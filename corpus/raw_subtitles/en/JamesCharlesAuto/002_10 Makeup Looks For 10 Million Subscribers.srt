55
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,720

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,970
inside at the mall and it the next

57
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,460

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,960
at the mall for the ribbon-cutting it

you may have missed it since my category

76
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,300
was not televised apparently when you

77
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,769
get hundreds and hundreds of thousands

78
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,269
of votes if you're a digital influencer

79
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,940
or you're still not important enough

80
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:31,440
which is just lovely so fighting against

81
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,090
that every single day but regardless

82
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,430
it's the People's Choice Awards and that

83
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,989
means you guys voted and that means way

84
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,230
more to me than any trophy that we can

85
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,739
win any single day so still thank you

86
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,390
the most

87
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,560
so the PCs were on a Sunday and the next

88
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,720
thing was Monday meaning it was my

89
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,640
pallet launch party tonight and oh my

90
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,590
god you guys I was so beyond excited

91
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,970
this party was planned at very very

92
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,320
last-minute so myself in the morphe team

93
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,910
were literally hustling all day long

94
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,040
picture was actually gonna be ready for

95
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,390
everybody to come and celebrate inspired

96
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,640
by the unleash your inner artist theme

97
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,709
of the palette it was an all-white party

98
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,810
which proved to not last for very long

99
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,150
judging by myself getting paint pour all

100
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,010
over me and my iconic custom outfit but

101
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,720
it was truly a night I will never forget

102
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,950
and I am so grateful to have every

103
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,110
single person in my life that has been

104
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,989
supporting me since day one I was

105
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,329
sobbing crying during my little speech

106
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,920
with Linda Murphy the owner and CEO I

107
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:21,420
really don't cry or get emotional that

108
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,030
often I will say I definitely have built

109
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,280
up a very very thick skin over the past

110
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,450
several years but there were just so

111
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,920
many people they were supporting me that

112
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,209
I could not help but get so emotional

113
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,859
and be so grateful for everything that

114
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,019
has happened in the past few months so I

115
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,239
sobbed thank all the makeup was okay but

116
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,320
after that I got ruined by gallons and

117
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,910
gallons of paint being poured on me

118
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,010
regardless and my outfit being

119
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,090
completely ruined well not really ruined

120
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,100
oh I guess because everybody got to

121
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,840
unleash their inner artist at the party

122
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,280
which was so much fun I am so incredibly

123
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,480
grateful for everybody in my life that

124
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,769
was able to make it and also everybody

125
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,730
who wasn't able to make it as well

126
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,349
obviously

127
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,030
a lot of charges going on at the time in

128
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,379
California with the fires and so many

129
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,819
other things but the support has meant

130
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,379
so much to me regardless and also major

131
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,580
thank you as well to every single person

132
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,989
on the murphy team that i have worked or

it has been so incredibly amazing and i

135
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,540
could not believe it is finally here and

136
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,430
without everybody this would not have

137
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,140
happened so you guys know who you are

138
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,519
love you all the most after the launch

139
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,900
party everybody jumped in the party bus

140
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,489
back to my house and we were literally

141
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,989
awake until 5:00 in the morning

142
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,910
celebrating um everybody got very they

143
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,590
had fun and so did I but I'm a sister

144
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,510
sober of course as if you guys know

145
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,000
because I had to wake up in literally

146
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,370
two hours because the next day was a

147
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,750
launch day waking up at 7:00 a.m. with

148
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,070
my parents and some of the more fut

149
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,580
members who had slept over was neither

150
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,080
fun nor rational either right now but it

151
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,460
was all worth it because at 8:00 a.m.

152
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,830
Pacific Standard Time

153
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,780
we broke make up history with the launch

154
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,360
of the James Charles X morphe palette

155
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,240
and oh my god you guys I am so

156
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,500
incredibly grateful we launched with

157
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,270
quite a lot of units I obviously cannot

158
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,070
release those numbers but we sold out of

159
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,220
the entire collection in Europe

160
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:59,580
Australia and Canada in less than 10

161
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,550
minutes and sold out globally in less

162
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,260
than one day breaking morphe records and

163
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,870
having their highest sales day in

164
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,400
history which is iconic well I'll be are

165
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,500
celebrating the palette sellout I don't

166
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,970
even know how it happened but you guys

167
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,650
pulled together and we had 10 million

168
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,050
sister subscribers on this YouTube

169
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,120
channel oh my god you guys we started

170
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,580
this channel only three years ago now

171
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,990
and never in 10 million years did I ever

172
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,820
think we would get this far

173
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,289
I like I cannot believe the progress

174
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,030
that we've had together as a family

175
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,289
this journey has been a quite the roller

176
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,150
coaster but I started this with a

177
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,099
mission in mind of creating beautiful

178
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,720
and creative makeup looks creating

179
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:38,910
entertainment content making you guys

180
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,800
happy and I can truly say we haven't

181
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,599
shaken up the beauty industry for the

182
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
better and then literally one day later

183
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:47,460
we also some have energy to hit 10

184
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,560
million on Instagram as well bringing

185
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,289
our total like social media reach to

186
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,789
over 20 million sisters which is so

187
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,910
beyond crazy I feel like we're literally

188
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,980
running a nation up

189
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,270
here and it feels so amazing and I am so

190
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,860
incredibly grateful for every single one

191
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,200
of you guys trust me if it were not for

192
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,270
you I would not be here and that is a

193
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,440
judgment promise I love my job and I am

194
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,540
so grateful that I get to do it and

195
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,280
inspire you guys every single day and

196
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,870
thank you from the bottom of my heart

197
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,610
truly after all those amazing things

198
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,290
that went on I decided for once in my

199
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,730
life to take a little bit of a break

200
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,080
most importantly I wanted to celebrate

201
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,150
with everybody in my life that means the

202
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,340
absolute most me but I also wanted to

203
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,620
chill to relax it take some time for

204
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,910
myself and my mental health because it

205
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,010
was a little sister struggling and

206
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,420
[ __ ] Ally but I also took a few days

207
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,010
as well to plant some really amazing

208
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,170
content coming soon I am so beyond

209
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,120
excited and after all that I am ready to

210
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,770
be back to pump up some amazing videos

211
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,930
for you guys of course using this baby

212
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,070
right here and that leads us to today's

213
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,150
brand new video

214
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,650
so you guys saw the finished and

215
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,030
beautiful 52 second commercial that I

216
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,830
was so incredibly proud of but what you

217
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,950
don't know is that that commercial was

218
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:50,050
shot not once but twice and both times

219
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,610
took well over a week to produce we

220
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,410
literally hired a videographer to come

221
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,000
on set and film the makeup creation

222
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,800
process of every single one of those

223
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,390
looks so I could later convert it into a

224
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,340
tutorial for this YouTube channel but

225
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,100
that didn't exactly work out when it

226
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,840
started taking five six seven hours to

227
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,670
create each look so unfortunately I do

228
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,870
not have tutorials of the campaign books

229
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,220
except for of course the unleash your

230
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,020
inner artist book which if you have not

231
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,850
seen that video make sure to click right

232
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,470
up here and I'm trying to think what I

233
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,180
want to do for my ten million video I

234
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,250
have to do something big iconic I have

235
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,990
to celebrate and I thought do I want to

236
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,520
brace myself and do every single one of

237
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,050
those looks again and film them as

238
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,050
tutorials and I came to the conclusion

239
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,100
no I'd rather not die on camera so then

240
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,570
I was thinking okay and maybe I'll make

241
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,250
it a lot easier for myself and just do

242
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,600
one of the locks so I created it and

243
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,120
after reading through thousands of

244
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,530
replies I gathered that you guys kind of

245
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,230
liked all of them and nobody could agree

246
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,210
so I do of course have a compromise

247
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,250
hopefully I can actually pull this off

248
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,110
but so my favorite looks that I've been

249
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,400
seeing so far from you sisters that have

250
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,720
been actually able to get the palette

251
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,790
and start to play with it happen looks

252
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,820
or you can bind a few different of the

253
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,770
campaign images into one so for today's

254
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,510
video since you guys could not decide at

255
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,740
which look you liked better I thought I

256
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,690
would have went out the palette

257
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,880
absolutely literally every single color

258
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,129
in here and try to recreate all the

259
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,689
campaign images on my face

260
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,129
one time this is gonna be a little bit

261
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:07,689
of like a weird mix of a tutorial video

262
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,589
but also mostly just be playing the

263
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,939
actual palette

264
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,289
I'll show you guys every single color

265
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,999
and they're the techniques that I like

266
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:14,919
to use for maximum color payoff and

267
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:16,149
blend ability and also a little bit of a

268
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,679
behind-the-scenes look of how I created

269
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:19,629
every single one of these looks so

270
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:21,939
without further ado Oh Kyra pink kitty

271
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:23,139
drink idiot grab a snack and let's get

272
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:25,330
started and I'll leash our in our

273
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:30,780
artists

274
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:32,740
[Music]

275
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,870
after looking at all the images and

276
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,020
stalking a few guys on Twitter as well I

277
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,310
saw this look by yani Mui she's home

278
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,959
credibly talented and she actually

279
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,339
combined all the campaign looks into one

280
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,750
I'm gonna change a few things but I'm

281
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,830
gonna use her photos inspirations today

282
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,040
because I think she did a really good

283
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,830
job picking the places to put everything

284
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,000
so thanks girl let's get started my base

285
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,160
is already on because this video is

286
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,050
gonna be focused on mostly at shadows da

287
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,760
so I'm gonna go ahead and grab my Mac

288
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,790
Paint Pot in the shade up painterly and

289
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,079
my morphe m17 3 brush that this is in

290
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,089
the jamesrowe specs morphe brush

291
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,860
collection and we're gonna use this to

292
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,020
prime my eyelids and get ready for

293
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,029
shadow sorta often that's gonna grab up

294
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,890
my palate oh my god it feels so crazy to

295
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,270
actually say that holy crap um I

296
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,160
promised yours will not come looking

297
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,000
like this this is actually the first one

298
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,290
that was ever made so I've been

299
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,209
traveling with this and using this for

300
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,890
several months now she's been through

301
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,600
quite a lot she's been dropped she's

302
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,980
been you she's been dug in too but she

303
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,930
still gets the job done so I'm gonna

304
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,490
first grab with my morphe m4a3 3 brush

305
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,930
and just dip into the shade at you're

306
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,200
kidding which is literally the best

307
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,940
Bruntlett which is literally the best

308
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,260
bright red and the entire world and I'm

309
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,579
just going to it start laying that on

310
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,750
the eyelid this property's gonna be the

311
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:40,360
easiest eye look you'll ever do because

312
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,410
we were literally just doing a look at

313
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,970
how pigmented that is I'm just packing

314
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,640
this color right onto the lid over top

315
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,380
of my Mac Paint Pot aka dry base

316
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,000
formulated specifically for the eyes

317
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,339
because those are the techniques that

318
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,750
are gonna give you the best results as I

319
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,190
said a million times I'm gonna use that

320
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,510
brush to kind of stamp out roads a

321
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,399
little bit because I am gonna kind of

322
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,290
wing it this out and pull it towards my

323
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,820
temple and then with whatever access

324
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,260
shadow is left on that brush I'm just

325
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,360
gonna start lightly going over those

326
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,649
edges to buff them out and make sure

327
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,610
they are nice and blended

328
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:08,200
I'm gonna have a little bit of a

329
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,750
fluffier brush and use this to go over

330
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,459
the edges and start drying out this red

331
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,160
eye shadow down underneath the eyeball

332
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:16,990
and also kind of everywhere else as well

333
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,610
to make this look less weight and I

334
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,990
don't 501 brush I'm gonna dip into the

335
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,819
shader literally it next to you're

336
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,439
kidding

337
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:24,809
I'm gonna give that a quick spritz I'll

338
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:27,059
buy a weapon set setting spray and use

339
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,279
that to meld together the red tones and

340
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,769
the highlighter that I already had on oh

341
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,539
my god I love the shadow so what much

342
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,339
the last step of the love stay click

343
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,470
it's of course the hearts now on the day

344
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,629
of set I actually put on a heart sticker

345
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,009
first and then did all the red and just

346
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:44,189
peeled it off and we had a nice and

347
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:45,809
negative space moment I do not have any

348
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:47,009
more heart stickers and I could not find

349
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:48,959
them at the craft stores today for some

350
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:51,059
reason so we're now going to draw them

351
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,279
on and hope that it looks okay I'm gonna

352
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,559
put one right here oh thank god

353
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,899
oh my god okay I'm gonna put another one

354
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,309
right here I'm gonna quickly set that in

355
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,109
place with just a little bit of canvas

356
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,189
on a tiny little pencil brush just to

357
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:03,899
make sure that concealer doesn't move

358
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:06,660
around I do a little heart in the inner

359
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,459
corner to kind of cue alright that is

360
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,109
the elastic I've already done and

361
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,479
completes I'm gonna grab the same brush

362
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:14,789
and painterly and pop some on the other

363
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:16,499
eyelid and get started on the blue book

364
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:17,819
I'm first gonna grab the about four five

365
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:19,919
six which is my brush that I actually

366
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:21,509
created with morphia this is the tiny

367
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,759
blending brush and dip into the shader

368
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,679
Cola and I'm gonna use this to start

369
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,970
building out the outer V I'm placing on

370
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,679
this color first because in order to get

371
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,479
really really pigmented and bright dark

372
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,979
blues you do have to use a slightly

373
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:33,600
different techniques than a typical

374
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:35,459
eyeshadows like I talked about in my

375
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,169
original video which for some reason

376
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,699
caused quite the controversy very

377
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:40,049
literally no reason at all for me

378
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,669
personally I definitely felt as though

379
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:43,559
my reveal video was very very upfront

380
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,789
and honest you guys about the palette

381
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,049
and the different aromas and the

382
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:47,309
techniques that you should be using and

383
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:48,959
the different products that work best of

384
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,879
it in order for you guys to obviously

385
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,529
get the best possible results and for

386
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,899
some reason a lot of people seem to

387
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:56,189
think that I was lying or that I was

388
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,269
trying to get more money out of you guys

389
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:58,439
which first of all I don't even

390
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:00,029
understand how that even be a thought

391
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:01,529
process considering the product that I

392
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:04,499
recommended to work fast with this

393
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:06,479
morphe eyeshadow palette was a Mac Paint

394
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:07,919
Pot they are sharing none of the same

395
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:09,149
monies that's not even helping morphe

396
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,619
it's just generally a really bomb

397
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:11,699
product that myself and the morphe

398
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:13,529
product development team have found

399
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:15,329
works really really well with these type

400
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:16,799
of shadows but also as well if you guys

401
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,999
have follow me for a very very long time

402
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,409
you would know that I definitely used to

403
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:20,819
get involved with quite a lot of drama

404
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:22,829
in the social media space and I used to

405
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:23,880
have a very very snappy mouth and I've

406
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:25,440
been working on that

407
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,150
over the past several years and I feel

408
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,800
like I've definitely gotten way better

409
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,420
at biting my tongue and not replying to

410
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,490
people but watching these Palin videos

411
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,660
oh my god you guys third but it

412
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,250
definitely a few at this point that I

413
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,050
wanted to literally reach through my

414
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,790
computer screen and be like why what are

415
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,930
you doing now if any of us actually have

416
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,520
the palate you may have noticed that on

417
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,560
the front packaging it says the James

418
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,880
Charles artistry palette now this is not

419
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,830
because of the unleash your inner artist

420
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,240
bono it is actually because when I got

421
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,160
the opportunity to create this palette

422
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,310
with morphe I said I wanted to create

423
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,200
literally the best rainbow mattes on the

424
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,160
market and that we definitely did but

425
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,420
what I've learned is that when

426
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,510
pigmentation is your number one priority

427
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,920
which for me it 100% was some of the

428
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,120
shades actually do have to be formulated

429
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,220
just slightly differently than a typical

430
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,170
eyeshadow in order to get those really

431
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,730
really bright and vivid pigments to

432
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,990
create beautiful rainbow looks I've

433
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,040
talked about that several times now

434
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,660
that's what I was talking about in my

435
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,400
original reveal video when it came to

436
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,320
press pigments versus typical eyeshadows

437
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,610
and people really really read on that

438
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,380
and I'm really glad that this is kind of

439
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,630
created a bigger discussion about the

440
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,740
actual ingredients and makeup but who

441
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,510
some of the things that I've been seeing

442
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,620
people saying or doing regarding these

443
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:29,670
actual shades have been interesting to

444
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,810
watch say the least

445
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,040
since this is the unleash your inner

446
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,660
artist palette I figured the best

447
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,850
possible example I could give to you

448
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,440
guys would be an actual artist if an

449
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,140
artist was going to paint a picture they

450
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,120
would never slap paint onto a canvas sit

451
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,470
back and wait for it to magically blend

452
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,450
together to create a beautiful piece of

453
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,800
art no that is the whole point of being

454
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,060
an artist you actually have to put in

455
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,440
the work you have to build up your

456
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,960
talent level you have to use the right

457
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,190
materials tools paint brushes paints and

458
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,020
put it on the right canvas to produce

459
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,240
the final product if you want to create

460
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,310
a beautiful watercolor painting it does

461
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,260
not matter how bright how vivid how

462
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,690
blendable or how expensive your

463
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,550
watercolor kit is because chances are if

464
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,860
you apply those colors to a canvas

465
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,300
they're simply never going to perform as

466
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,580
well as they could if they were applied

467
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,890
to watercolor paper now same thing goes

468
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,990
to acrylic paint or oil paint if you

469
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,340
apply those paints to a watercolor paper

470
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,140
chances are the paints are probably

471
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,360
going to soak through and melt it and

472
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,740
it's going to be a huge mess now of

473
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,570
course you can do those things if you

474
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,730
want to there are no rules to art but

475
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,590
for me I've always looked at makeup

476
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,870
specifically eyeshadow and in the same

477
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,630
exact way both art and makeup are not

478
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,520
easy they take a lot of time a lot of

479
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,960
raucous and a lot of talent but I nature

480
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,760
artists knows that sometimes switching

481
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,340
up your products and techniques to get a

482
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,990
better final result is always worth it I

483
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,220
was literally so far and deep into that

484
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,810
tangent that my camera stopped recording

485
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,790
and I just missed half of this purple

486
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,380
look sorry about that before I move on

487
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,610
I'm very proud of this palette I've

488
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,020
worked way too hard on has to do with a

489
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,060
lot of speculation so I just wanted to

490
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,980
clear all that up moving on that as the

491
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,830
blue look all complete I used the shades

492
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,030
hello playground Cola and a little bit

493
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,070
of brother to pull this all together

494
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,540
love how this look turned out and I'm

495
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,830
going to move on to it the galaxy log

496
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,090
before I do any of the art because the

497
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,370
purple is going to be it's super super

498
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,440
easy so what I've done so far is grab

499
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,450
the morphe M 4-3-3 brush and I've just

500
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,220
dip it into the shade single and I've

501
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,970
used this too it just kind of stipple it

502
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,920
all over my face

503
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,660
really really nicely just to get a light

504
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,370
wash of purple on there I want to get

505
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,070
like that nice kind of almost splotchy

506
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,570
wash of color lay down in this area so I

507
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,100
can add on lots of other things on top

508
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,540
and even though we are doing this mostly

509
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,980
I am definitely trying to keep most of

510
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,690
the pigment like right around kind of

511
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,120
the nose bridge and around like this

512
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,100
inner cheek region and lightly blending

513
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,170
out those edges so even if it's splotchy

514
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,610
it still looks good now with that same

515
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,530
exact brush I'm gonna dip into the shade

516
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,140
escape and I'm gonna use this once again

517
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,630
to kind of splotchy Li just dab on some

518
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,190
more pigment and dimension and then

519
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,630
final I'm just gonna take an AM at 5:06

520
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,980
brush and dip into the black shade it's

521
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,780
spooky and I'm just gonna do a little

522
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,210
bit of this because it definitely goes a

523
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,560
long way it this is so pigmented and I'm

524
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,960
just gonna add on a few more little

525
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,030
sister splotches here and there for some

526
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,380
final bits of a galaxy dimension now to

527
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,850
tie it all together I'm gonna grab the

528
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,820
shade artistry which is this a beautiful

529
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,320
metallic duo call blue purple shade or

530
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,510
right here and I'm gonna go this on my

531
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,070
finger and then it's going to a top over

532
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,820
some of the areas at the Galant oh my

533
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,080
god look at that

534
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,640
I'm gonna tap right over some of the

535
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,670
areas of the galaxy it to pack the shade

536
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,780
on there and to add some blue glow now

537
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,310
like I was talking about earlier with

538
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,660
different formulas being used this is

539
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,010
definitely one of the more unique ones

540
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,390
in the palette I've seen a lot of people

541
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,100
watching this one and being a little bit

542
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,540
disappointed by the color payoff it can

543
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,100
be used on its own if you want and it's

544
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,450
still absolutely stunning but the shade

545
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,280
is actually meant to be layered over top

546
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,680
of other colors hence what I'm doing

547
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,660
right now for the fall beautiful effect

548
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,610
by the way that shade literally is the

549
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,680
same way as well this one is meant to be

550
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,080
a kind of mixing shade for a highlighter

551
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,360
and blush but can still be used on its

552
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,040
own

553
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,449
very very beautifully and then last name

554
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,610
it's gonna grab a simple white liquid

555
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:48,839
liner to add on these stars so probably

556
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,459
the hardest part this entire campaign

557
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,439
was drawing and shading in every single

558
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,879
one of these hexagons when it came to

559
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:56,189
the B look now I think I'm gonna get it

560
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,509
done right now to get it over with so I

561
00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:00,149
can do the slime and the flame because

562
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:00,629
those are gonna be kind of easy let's do

563
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,949
this

564
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:03,540
to do this I'm just gonna grab an angle

565
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:05,459
brush and I'm gonna dip into the shade T

566
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,559
in the top right corner let's start the

567
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,669
first one right here for the next one

568
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,049
it's gonna do the same exact thing but

569
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:12,329
leave a little bit of a gap in between

570
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:13,860
if first I'm a really odd reason do you

571
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,809
want to recreate this at home which I

572
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,519
don't know why you would but if you just

573
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,870
want to be a queen bee for a day and you

574
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,149
have trouble with patterns because let

575
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,439
me tell you this is hard okay

576
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:23,880
we had lipstick Nick we're literally on

577
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,589
site trying to figure out what shape we

578
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,630
were doing for a good like two hours

579
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,529
before I actually ended up looking okay

580
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,149
so I would definitely recommend

581
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:31,799
practicing on like your arm or your leg

582
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,120
before you go right onto your face so

583
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,470
you don't mess up so now I'm gonna grab

584
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,960
the tiny little faulty brush this is the

585
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,269
m15 to two of these come in Maya brush

586
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,039
set and dip it did the shader punish me

587
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:42,659
which is this cool toilet light brown

588
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,990
and I'm gonna use this shade to blend

589
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:48,720
out all those lines so I want to do the

590
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:51,120
top right corner to be the most dark so

591
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,889
I'm gonna focus the color right in there

592
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,630
and then lightly blend out the arc

593
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:56,850
furnace okay I'm just gonna go in now

594
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,049
and blend out those edges I'm next to

595
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,610
get a little small brush and dip into

596
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:01,559
the shades in canvas and also a little

597
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,240
bit of it be at the bright yellow and

598
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,190
use these two colors to kind of

599
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,779
highlight the middle of these honey

600
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,889
columns so now that the combs are all on

601
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:09,450
there at the last and final step of this

602
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:11,490
look is going to be to grab a little bit

603
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,590
of concealer and a very tiny liner brush

604
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,059
this is the amma two-five-zero it's in

605
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,980
the brush kit and you can take again so

606
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,940
what we're gonna do

607
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,840
[Music]

608
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,460
alright so I'm gonna leave the queen bee

609
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,170
look alone for right now of course they

610
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,030
do want to add honey and later on but

611
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,380
that's gonna get really messy and really

612
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,170
sister sticky so I'm gonna go ahead and

613
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,550
move on to the flames to start sketching

614
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,930
out the fire I'm just gonna grab a matte

615
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,520
orange liquid lipstick this is

616
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,530
flamethrower from jeffree star cosmetics

617
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,910
I would use an orange eyeshadow with

618
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,200
that it's gonna take me eight hours so

619
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,310
sorry about it

620
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,350
everybody's just gonna go in and start

621
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,610
like sketching the flames for the orange

622
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,410
I'm gonna grab four three three brush

623
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,840
and dip into the shade at 5:08

624
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,830
first I'm gonna lay this down over top

625
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,480
um

626
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,010
the local dough stick didn't do you have

627
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,510
to bring it down to my neck okay right

628
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:59,190
like try to take this off I wonder oh my

629
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,270
god what I was scared and it's not one

630
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,930
video without having a mental breakdown

631
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,930
like just one

632
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,790
that took way too long okay now to add

633
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,170
some more dimension into the flame so

634
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,270
we're gonna do is grab a little pencil

635
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,530
brush and dip into the shaded B which is

636
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,140
literally the best of bright yellow

637
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,940
pigment in the entire world and I'm

638
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,620
going to put this in like the center

639
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,880
areas of the flames so that is the fire

640
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,560
look all complete we only have two

641
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,290
colors left being the green it's live

642
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,880
and then also the pink bubblegum now I

643
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,070
want to put this line right here join

644
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,680
for my jaw line so it like makes sense

645
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,580
grab a brow garment gravitationally grab

646
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,460
gravitationally it's not a word

647
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,050
thank you the gravitational pull

648
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,250
gravitationally it's a word now I'm

649
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,650
gonna put this line here so it makes

650
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,300
sense gravitationally but doing that at

651
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,370
least this big open space right here I

652
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,890
wanted to put a butterfly there but I

653
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,600
can't find them that's an issue so I

654
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,280
think because of the fact that the pink

655
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,650
look was and I look and then that I just

656
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,630
the bubble I need to somehow get like

657
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,250
the pink in here somehow so I think I

658
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,350
want to draw in a bunch of little pink

659
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,460
bubbles as if they're like floating so

660
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,900
to draw the outline of the bubbles I'm

661
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,470
gonna use the Kylie liquid lipstick in

662
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,510
the shade

663
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,550
no more this is literally an exact match

664
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,800
to the shade skip so this will be a

665
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,420
really good fresh to draw it with that's

666
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,340
gonna grab the shade to skip on a flat

667
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,810
packing brush and just put that right on

668
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,310
there using that same brush I'm gonna

669
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,380
dip into the shade of pink idiot trinket

670
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:23,890
which is to get a matte super light baby

671
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,850
pink I'm gonna put this like here okay

672
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,400
with a little pencil brush I'm gonna

673
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,130
grab a little bit of playground just add

674
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,640
in just a little bit of blue because why

675
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,960
not

676
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,510
and then same thing with a little bit of

677
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,130
a social blade as well a little bit of B

678
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,630
as well then I'm gonna use the white

679
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,280
liquid liner once again and just add in

680
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,680
some reflections now I'm gonna draw the

681
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,310
slime at first using a cream paint just

682
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,310
to get the outline

683
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,930
and then just let it get in place using

684
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,980
a packer brush and the shader social

685
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:55,540
there's there's definitely a less self

686
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,990
hair in there and then describing a

687
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:03,400
packer brush and that shade a packer

688
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:05,230
brush and the shade socialblade scary

689
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,090
with that same Packer brush I'm just

690
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,740
gonna dip into the shades B and also a

691
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,240
little bit of flashback as well and use

692
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,650
those to highlight inside of the slime

693
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,210
this tiny little detailing brush so

694
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,010
going to dip into the shade daddy and

695
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,840
I'm gonna use this to shade more of this

696
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,550
line and add in some little drip tips

697
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:23,590
and then once again at some more white

698
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:25,030
highlights I'm gonna put on a black

699
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,860
liquid lipstick up because it's the only

700
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,760
color that will not clash with every

701
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,770
single one of the other colors in my

702
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,980
