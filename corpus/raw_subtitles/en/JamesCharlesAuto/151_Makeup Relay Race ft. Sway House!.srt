218
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,370

ya girlfriend Johnson no Griffin so you

258
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,490
blew up on tik-tok because you were a

259
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,930
nurse yeah and medical school yeah I

260
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,850
want to know how you blew up in the

261
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,410
first place and how you decided to leave

262
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,060
nursing school because I think that's a

263
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,710
crazy decision that's when I first met

264
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,090
you I'll just say it too

265
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,100
okay I said into Griffin's do you have a

266
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,810
feeling about this case so Q is very

267
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,550
very smart but then we actually became

268
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:45,180
really good friends first off you can

269
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,420
always go back to scores yes I yes so my

270
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,730
idea of this was if I can go back and do

271
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,680
this later I always can like finish it I

272
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,420
I mean school is always pretty easy for

273
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,510
me right like this I feel like this is

274
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,730
an opportunity and

275
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,019
everyone you know gets and I was working

276
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,880
at it I really love that mindset because

277
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:02,290
at school is it super super important

278
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,550
like I always encourage my followers

279
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,019
they go to school pay attention in class

280
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,610
to your work like it's really really

281
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:08,320
important but at the same time school is

282
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,820
always there I'm like I'm a firm

283
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,680
believer like taking opportunities

284
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,120
taking risks so you got to a point I was

285
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,709
like okay I have enough of a following

286
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,630
and then I met the boys and we're all

287
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,709
gonna live together so yeah okay this is

288
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,389
worth it when was the first time that

289
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,910
you actually met all of that wasn't when

290
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,769

up like we had like a really good summer

293
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,459
and then I was like okay well I guess I

294
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:32,139
can come back and like finish or do

295
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:33,579

is so pretty oh thank you so Jaden the

320
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,430
first thing that I want to talk to you

321
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,319
about when you first started on social

322
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,630
media there was photos of you and like

323
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:34,779
cowboy Hawks you were like a country boy

324
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:37,930
huh yes sadly okay so I was born in

325
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:38,920
Texas all right and then when I was 14 I

326
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,779
moved to Tennessee

327
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,730
you know I everyone out there if you

328
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,350
don't conform to what everyone else

329
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,000
wears you're just like weird yeah I

330
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,449
didn't want to be weird to be honest I'm

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,490
sorry

332
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:50,920
right just didn't post scared but now

333
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,000
obviously several years later I really

334
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,980
want to come I do because I think it's

335
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,630
really cool how you're so open about

336
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,850
your style your music and everything and

337
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,019
I definitely enjoy that so speaking of

338
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,670
like a major transformation I think

339
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,110
you're tweeted like how like you buy

340
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,850
like only girls pants

341
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,889
yeah and how like you buy like a lot of

342
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,989
girls clothes yes

343
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:07,799
to my viewers probably sounds completely

344
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,989
normal because obviously they're

345
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,879
watching me I got a lot of hate doing

346
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:13,619
the exact things I did now you're gonna

347
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,970
mean like especially in Tennessee I know

348
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:15,989
it's whenever I first started sicked I

349
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,639
started painting my nails because I

350
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:19,319
thought it wasn't oh yeah like I was

351
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,929
actually a fan of Chase which is really

352
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:23,699
funny but I was a fan of Chase and I was

353
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:25,679
like yo this is so dope maybe I should

354
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,209
try and I did and I liked it yeah and

355
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,199
then I got my ears pierced but everyone

356
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,389
in my school actually almost got

357
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:32,100
suspended what because I had my eye

358
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:34,739
nails painted and everyone was just like

359
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,929
hating on me for it is so stupid yeah it

360
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:38,579
was crazy so I got my ears pierced I was

361
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:40,499
like ah I got beers beers inside up I

362
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,179
was in the graduation and I was wearing

363
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:43,439
my capping down the doors were open all

364
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,910
the parents were looking and then my

365
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,989
principal ran up it was like screaming

366
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,279
at me he was like you're not gonna

367
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:49,619
graduate if you have your ears pierced

368
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,309
eyes literal most ridiculous thing that

369
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,660
I've ever heard

370
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:53,519
ya know it made me feel really

371
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,649
embarrassed where I'm in now I just love

372
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,790
Who I am now yeah is it I like having

373
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,199
that story better than just being

374
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,910
someone who is like perfect their whole

375
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:01,499
life that's awesome now I can relate to

376
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,699
people on a different level right so

377
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:03,749
that's been pretty cool like people it's

378
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,689
good to think about yourself and love

379
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:08,369
yourself but ultimately it up we're

380
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:10,290
gonna go over time again I love any

381
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:11,639
other people it's not worth it yeah and

382
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,199
that's all that matters and I didn't get

383
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,339
that so I actually came out to LA and I

384
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,720
was like you know what everyone should

385
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,189
just do whatever they want like wear

386
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,110
what you want so I wear women's pants

387
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,129
cuz it fits my tiny butt better and I do

388
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,689
whatever I want because that's what

389
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:24,829
matters I think that's so cool I really

390
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:27,299
do good I didn't make you look better

391
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:29,220

popular person on the alpha everybody is

414
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,339
obsessed with what happened and like how

415
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,589
does that make you feel so I made a

416
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,089
video because my sister actually was

417
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,310
giving me crap because I didn't have as

418
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:25,139
many followers as her on tick tock and I

419
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,120
even have an account okay that kind of

420
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,129
lit a fire under me and I wanted to like

421
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,040
prove her wrong hmm so I made a couple

422
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:34,829

423
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,839
few videos and like mid-january okay I

424
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:40,949

425
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:43,290

426
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:46,259

427
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,430
amazing mother okay a few months later

428
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:49,500

429
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,910
biggest growing people on the app every

430
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,410

the every boys have stuff to do okay

432
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,100
like how how do you go from just being

433
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:57,720
like a regular college student to that

434
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,630
all of a sudden like being literally the

435
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,300
world's heartthrob I don't answer that

436
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,130
like is it still like surreal to me

437
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,810
honestly it's really cool too because

438
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,339
like everyone I feel like at some point

439
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,449
in social media you know as you're

440
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,680
growing really fast it really easy to

441
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,670
let everything kind of get to your head

442
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,779
and the one thing that I really love

443
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,189
about you and that I feel like a lot of

444
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,779
the fans have noticed as well as like

445
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:17,100
every paparazzi video every video at the

446
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,630
high post like you're always smiling

447
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,639
you're always taking photos with fans

448
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,350
and Mike I think your smile really does

449
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,120
like rub off on others and I think

450
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,750
that's really cool I mean I just think

451
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,939
of it like if it was me and then she's

452
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:35,040
like I don't you want like the same

453
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:36,140
attention but yeah I mean I'm not by any

454
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,610
means calling myself

455
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,230
anything like that but I don't know like

456
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,400
if I were to see like Zac Efron or

457
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,720
something like that walking by I'd be

458
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,100

459
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,540
