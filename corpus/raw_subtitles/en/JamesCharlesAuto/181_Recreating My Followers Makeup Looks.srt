my palette restocked for the first time

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,509
since the initial launch on more feet

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,830
calm you guys know we sold it out when

9
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,960
the leave few hours the first time and

10
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,570
once again and his sister sold out

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,480
worldwide which literally like my mind

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,310
is blown and I am so beyond grateful for

all of your guys's love and support and

14
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,340
I never in a million years would have

15
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,769
even expected to have the opportunity to

16
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,120
make a makeup product let alone do it

17
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,010
with morphe you make it literally the

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,050
best in the entire world and how the

19
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,820
demand and reaction just be so kindly

20
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,520
positive that it sells out not once but

21
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,899
twice like holy crap obviously the goal

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,040
this palette was to inspire people and

23
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,809
make people want to go on to their

24
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,890
comfort zones and play with color and I

25
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,629
will confidently say that we are

26
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,309
definitely doing that some of the looks

27
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,460
that I am seeing from this palette are

28
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,960
like mind-blowing the Tala is unreal and

29
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,460
that is what brings me to today's new

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,420

35
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,070
that two of these videos in the past so

36
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,710
far but they are truly one of my

37
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,180
all-time favorite series to film because

38
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,380

42

palette and I also tweeted asking for a

102
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,660
bunch of different artists to submit

103
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,580
looks like they've done this well just

104
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,080
the case I missed any and I picked out

105
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,210
three to do for today's video that I

106
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,190
think are gonna be so much fun and I'm

107
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,340
so excited for this first one because I

108
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,800
picked up this iconic look by makeup by

109
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,930
Raquel oh my god look at how pretty this

110
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,700
is it is just a warm toned brown smokey

111
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,500
eye but she added this beautiful pop of

112
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,120
yellow in the inner corner Brickhouse

113
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,430
one way all-time favorite artist to

114
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,470
follow right now she is literally 16

115
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,910
years old and she's been doing so many

116
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,950
incredible looks using the palette like

117
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,300
oh my god that blending work is insane I

118
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,830
invited her to my launch party and she

119
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,750
was just so incredibly sweet and is so

120
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,160
talented she reminds me a lot of myself

121
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,870
from a few years ago and I think she's

122
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,730
gonna go very very far in this industry

123
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,500
so please go check her out and show your

124
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,970
social support and love as always I

125
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,680
figured this look would be perfect to do

126
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,810
first and today is a brand video because

127
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,850
so many people have been requesting a

128
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,470
glam look from me which I totally get

129
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,910
obviously I've been focusing a lot on

130
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,620
the rainbow colors because that's kind

131
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,510
of the point of the palette but I did

132
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,860
put in a ton of beautiful neutral and

133
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,270
warm tone shades and there as well

134
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,230
perfect for everybody who doesn't feel

135
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,030
as comfortable wearing those crazy

136
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,560
colors on their eyelids and just want

137
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,850
something a little bit more wearable on

138
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,320
an everyday basis

139
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,570
this look is gonna be perfect because it

140
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,550
is a typical glam look but it still adds

141
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,750
a little bit of a pop of color for those

142
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,220
you who just want to dip your toes in

143
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,720
but don't feel comfortable going all the

144
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,580
way I'm gonna start off my drop of Miami

145
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,230
won 7-3 brush and dipping it to my back

146
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,140
Paint Pot in the shade of painterly

147
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,070
and using this to a prime my eyelids so

148
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,540
opening up the palette we're gonna be

149
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,060
mainly focusing on at the middle row of

150
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,010
bigger pans right here obviously we are

151
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,810
gonna add a pop of color later on but I

152
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,490
firmly did all these shades perfect for

153
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,350
creating any warm tone smokey eye and

154
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,060
that is exactly what we were doing today

155
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,410
I'm gonna first so if I can get a matte

156
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,180
four or five six brush and dipping into

157
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,640
the shade and no beans and this is the

158
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,500
warm tone of brown in the palette and

159
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,930
I'm just gonna pop the shade right onto

160
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,240
my eyelid I'm nicer than have another m4

161
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,550
fine

162
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,319
ruslan dip into a 10% off and I'm just

163
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,509
gonna place this shade right above that

164
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,370
no beans color and just blend it lightly

165
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,750
upwards just kind of chopping that shade

166
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,490
on there first and then using light

167
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,349
little circular motions just to blend

168
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,210
out that Brown edge moving right up the

169
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:59,949
line I'm resting up in a mat 4-3-3 brush

170
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,960
and dip into the shader code James a

171
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:03,130
right next door and same exact thing I'm

172
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,599
gonna use this color to go right over

173
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,520
that edge and start blending a little

174
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:08,500
bit more upwards just using light

175
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,849
circular motions and then finally with

176
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,259
an eye before for one I'm gonna dip into

177
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:13,270
the shade of two and they're just a

178
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:15,009
little bit of family as well and use

179
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,180
this to blend out that final edge will

180
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:17,590
be gone to the lower lash then I'm gonna

181
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,150
take the same I'm four five six brush

182
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,520
and the shade and no beads and just tuck

183
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,840
this right up in there bringing it all

184
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,639
the way across the lower lash line and

185
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,409
also making sure to connect it up with

186
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,919
that outer V on the upper lash line as

187
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,930
well

188
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,280
I cannot stand in smoky eyes when the

189
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,810
lower and upper lash line are not

190
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,330
connected I think it looks really really

191
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,440
messy so just put that collar there plug

192
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,970
in the same exact color order next

193
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,610
undergrad about ten percent off and

194
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,099
blend that edge out and blend this right

195
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,110
below no beans and then coat James and

196
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,159
then finally five honey in tune to

197
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,349
highlight the brow bone are gonna grab a

198
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:49,659
little bit of a face on just a flat top

199
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:52,270
little brush and give it a quick spritz

200
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:54,159
of the oven set setting spray and just

201
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,479
pop that right up in there I'm gonna

202
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,830
grab my tiny bit of five money on just

203
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,240
that same and four for one brush and go

204
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,070
over that because that was a little much

205
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,659
so that is the brown smokey I literally

206
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,639
already complete using the entire

207
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:05,349
mineral of the palette like I said you

208
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,880
guys I picked these colors for a reason

209
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,419
it is so easy to create the most

210
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,940
beautiful

211
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:11,469
chocolatey warm tone I look ever I'm

212
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,810
obsessed with how this turned out now

213
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:15,310
you could totally stop here but I do

214
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,960
want to add it just a little bit of a

215
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,310
pop of color you guys it is so much fun

216
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,719
to do so I'm trying to decide that

217
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,190
because in Raquel's original photo she

218
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:23,319
had a pop of yellow in the inner corner

219
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,469
which was so beyond a stunning like I

220
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,699
was obsessed with it but sister Kylie

221
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,169
recently posted a picture where she had

222
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,460
a pop of a pink in the inner corner and

223
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,139
it was so beyond sunny

224
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,580
I feel like inner corner colors is

225
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,319
becoming a major ten right now so I

226
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,460
think just to switch things up a little

227
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,199
bit because I have been doing a lot of

228
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,500
yellow recently I want to do a pop of

229
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,090
pink so to do a pop of color

230
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,350
for three one this is a little pencil

231
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,479
brush that comes in the brush set and

232
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,400
dip into the bright neon pink shade a

233
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,840
called skip no I do want to give you a

234
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,030
fair warning you guys if this pink shade

235
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,160
is insanely pigmented and if you have a

236
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,560
sensitive skin it may or may not cause

237
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,110
staining so be careful I'm just gonna

238
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,310
pop this shade right here I'm just

239
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,780
popping it right in that inner corner

240
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,430
and then using any excess that's left on

241
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,590
the brush to kind of lightly blend it

242
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,900
into the kind of transition shades that

243
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,490
we had going on around the eye I'm not

244
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,320
going to a matte five six to in a tiny

245
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,120
little bit more of skip but really top

246
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,560
off the access and just use this to

247
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,570
Crabb fluffily fluffily watch this is a

248
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,220
fluffy brush I'm scared just blend out

249
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,419
the address gonna dip into a little bit

250
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,009
of pink kitty drink a tea to help me

251
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,360
blend this out as well next for that pop

252
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,220
of glow I'm gonna dip into the shade of

253
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,410
litter leaves in that same little pencil

254
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,880
brush I absolutely love this color that

255
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,130
is one of my favorites from the palette

256
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,320
I'm gonna give this a good spread of the

257
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,389
morphe prepping setting spray and just

258
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,610
tap that right in the center just to

259
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,500
really make that shadow pop I'm just

260
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,570
gonna have a tiny little bit of a liquid

261
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,699
at glitter and they tiny little pencil

262
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,870
brush and dot dot right over top and

263
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,340
lastly probably not least I'm going to

264
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,229
line my waterline using the Makeup

265
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,250
Forever aqua oxalic color pencil in the

266
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,570
shade pink

267
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,560
you definitely could skip this step if

268
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,150
you don't feel comfortable putting a

269
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,139
pink and your waterline I know some

270
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,330
people may think that that would look

271
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,860
sickly you can definitely do a nude or a

272
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,330
block and said if you want a more smoky

273
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,500
look but for me personally I really

274
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,090
really like when the pop of color just

275
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,169
continues in if you like it really pulls

276
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,550
the whole eye look together

277
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,870
alright that is officially one eye all

278
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,250
complete I'm gonna go ahead and do that

279
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,900
one off camera quickly and I'll be right

280
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,009
back with the finished look I just

281
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,050
finished up the other bronze smokey eye

282
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,490
and I decided the pink looks a very very

283
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,560
beautiful but not our of Raquel's

284
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,820
original photo I do want to add a pop of

285
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,800
yellow in the inner corner just because

286
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,270
the look was literally too pretty not to

287
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,710
recreate and also to show you guys that

288
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,750
you can do this with literally any of

289
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,520
the color I mean a purple would be so

290
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,960
sunny with this a blue a green like

291
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,849
literally anything would look so pretty

292
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,540
with this so I was gonna do it the pop

293
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:32,550
of yellow

294
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,320
to grab a little bit of pee on a pencil

295
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,300
brush same exact technique is the pink

296
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,610
just popping the shade right in there oh

297
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,840
my god so pigmented like the pink Center

298
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,190
was gonna grab a fluffy brush and just

299
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,010
have been to a little bit that same a

300
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,270
shade B and just Suzi is to lightly buff

301
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,190
out the edges of that yellow and make

302
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,200
sure it's evenly diffused into both the

303
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,510
regular skin around the area and also

304
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,380
into the orange of the smoky eye just

305
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,000
like the other side kind of got me a

306
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,860
little bit of regulate on a tiny little

307
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,650
pencil brush and give it a quick spritz

308
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll sum up prep insect and use this to

309
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,650
highlight right on that inner corner

310
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,180
carving some more Beach make sure that's

311
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,920
nice and blend it out then carving a

312
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,420
little bit of a liquid glitter obviously

313
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,520
this one is it gold this time and

314
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,780
packing about right over top then I'm

315
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,550
gonna finish this yellow eye off with

316
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,530
just a yellow pencil liner this one is

317
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,660
from NYX gonna pop on a quick color of

318
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,950
mascaras in the Mac extended fight for

319
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,170
laughs today I'm gonna pop on the Lily

320
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,790
lashes and the style oh they are not

321
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,020
Miami's for once but they are very very

322
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,490
similar these ones are actually just

323
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,870
longer on the end so these are gonna be

324
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,070
perfect for an eye look like this where

325
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,260
we really want to focus it on the inner

326
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,960
corner and you can still always use code

327
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,430
James for 15% off so those are both

328
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,930
lines all complete I thought that was

329
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,880
gonna look crazy having two different

330
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,080
colors in the inner corner but kind of

331
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,180
like living for this little strawberry

332
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,800
banana lemonade but we have going on it

333
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,230
right now I'm gonna go ahead and brush

334
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,510
off any excess powder that we still on

335
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,130
at the face so we can move on to the

336
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,200
highlight can give my face a quick

337
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,610
spritz of the prep and settings right so

338
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
the highlighter has something to adhere

339
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,150
to and to kind of melt some of the

340
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,740
excess powder into the skin that on an

341
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,260
AM 501 I'm gonna dip into the shade of

342
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,290
face and just go right yeah a little bit

343
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,060
right above with the brow bone as always

344
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,830
Jim and then with that second m-43 one

345
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,260
from the brush set just a tiny little

346
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,780
dot on the tip of the nose and one lie

347
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,890
right down the center then finally my e4

348
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,390
brush I'm gonna dip into the shade it

349
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,340
literally the same color that I use on

350
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,900
my little pink inner corner you guys all

351
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,400
have been loving the shader recently for

352
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,930
blending together my highlight and blush

353
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,700
like I said in the beginning of the

354
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,470
video lips are already on for obvious

355
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,210
reasons and you guys I think that is the

356
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,460
first look inspired by a makeup by

357
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,720
raquel i'll complete

358
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:37,390
[Music]

359
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:38,980
I had that so much finally recreate this

360
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,050
look if I recount like it's kind of

361
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,840
rather too looks today like I said

362
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,340
before had such an easy go to warm tones

363
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,200
folky out using the middle row of the

364
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,820
palette this is exactly when I created

365
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,140
it and of course we got to do a little

366
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,760
puff of color as well just if it would

367
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,470
be whole unleash your inner artist theme

368
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,210
I think this is the perfect look for any

369
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,470
beginner makeup wear who wants to just

370
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,480
dip their toes into color but it's a

371
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,310
comfortable going all the way yet but

372
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,230
speaking of going all the way we have

373
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,570
two more looks to do so that further ado

374
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,040
let's jump on to luck number two alright

375
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,210
it is day number three I filming this

376
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,790
video but this is going to be look

377
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,530
number two I just wanted to say that

378
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,520
because of my hair it just got cut but

379
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,680
in the next that was going to go back to

380
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,910
long and really really gross this has

381
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,990
been a vest filming but we're gonna get

382
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,120
it done together

383
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,260
you and I so let's move on to the lock

384
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,540
so for the first think we definitely

385
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,160
kept it pretty simple glam still adding

386
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,140
a pop of color but a really really great

387
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,730
look for the everyday it girl on the go

388
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,260
but for look number two obviously that

389
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,120
says the artistry palette and it is a

390
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,920
full rainbow palette so for this look

391
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,480
you guys know how to throw in something

392
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,420
there with a whole lot of color so I

393
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,940
found this look by Lauren Bettles it is

394
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,740
this beautiful like rainbow cloud cut

395
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,240
crease with lots of glitter different

396
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,590
stars and I'm obsessed with how this

397
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,240
turned out oh my god I think it is so

398
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,650
pretty you guys know I don't get to play

399
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,640
with glitter that often on this YouTube

400
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,530
channel because I really really don't

401
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,060
like it but I feel like she used this

402
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,260
very very wisely in this stuff but I

403
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,610
also have a few other ideas up my sleeve

404
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,050
but I think I want to add to this look

405
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,420
to really tie it together as well so

406
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,560
without further ado let's jump in

407
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,690
so first let us rather than the inner

408
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,800
corner in that little crease moment and

409
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,720
obviously we're gonna cut out the cloud

410
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,610
later on but I'm first gonna cover to

411
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,380
m45 sex and dip into the shade Cola

412
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,450
which is the deep matte blue of the

413
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,180
palette and I'm just gonna pack Col up

414
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,220
right inside of that like inner crease

415
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,440
area and I'm gonna bring it out a little

416
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,610
bit farther to what I do cut crease is I

417
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,260
usually actually cut out right on the

418
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,480
crease line because I have this really

419
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,830
annoying flap of skin that like covers

420
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,420
my inner corner and seems like such a

421
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,100
stupid thing but you have no idea how

422
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,530
difficult it makes so many makeup looks

423
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,700
especially creases but with this cloud I

424
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,990
do want to kind of bring that in a

425
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,610
little

426
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,170
more so I'm going to take that into

427
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,760
consideration next article all I'm gonna

428
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,650
take a little bit of a daddy on the same

429
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,380
exact brush and place the shade as well

430
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,510
right next to it on the crease in the

431
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,490
crease why don't I just next to daddy

432
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,100
I'm gonna take it beyond an m4 3/3 brush

433
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,450
and places right there padding on the

434
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,800
color first and then blending it upwards

435
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,350
I'm gonna grab a little bit of you're

436
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,240
kidding on an M 4 5 6 brush as well and

437
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,380
put that in here I'm gonna add it

438
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,550
obviously in a lot more clutter that's

439
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,320
multiple of these all together but I

440
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,670
just want to kind of get the situation

441
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,420
started just like good amount of

442
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,730
everything out

443
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,100
I'm gonna grab escape I don't employ 5 6

444
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,360
brush and put this over here at least

445
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,860
and I need to go back into like all the

446
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,300
transitional colors to blend all this

447
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,030
together so it doesn't look disgusting

448
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,800
like this so what I'm going to do is

449
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,600
grab a fluffy brush and dip into it

450
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,950
single and I'm gonna use this and go

451
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,690
right over the edge of this red and

452
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,280
purple to diffuse these two colors

453
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,590
together and to blend out this outer

454
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,960
edge adding in some more of your kidding

455
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:27,000
a little bit more of B gonna buff out

456
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,350
that Daddy using a bit of social blade

457
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,790
and then finally a little bit of

458
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,380
playground just to buff out that inner

459
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,910
corner to cut the crease and create this

460
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,130
little cloud shape I'm gonna grab the

461
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,230

00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,780
ago I talked about how I always like my

545
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,160
pop on a glitter in the inner corner but

546
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,930
I'm just gonna take a little bit more of

547
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,690
that liquid liner and add in some dot

548
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,980
right on that white shade this is what I

549
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,420
like to do a lot too when it comes to

550
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,550
putting a bright highlight in the inner

551
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,260
corner because sometimes those are in

552
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,640
glitters or pigments they only shine a

553
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,260
super super bright if the light is

554
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,090
heading in but obviously depending on

555
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,440
your lighting it you can't always do

556
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,940
that so what I like to do is sometimes

557
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,980
take a white ladder and put a ton of

558
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,330
little dots here it's almost like mimic

559
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,890
the look of glitter because that way you

560
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,510
can still layer glitter over top of it

561
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,160
but even if the light doesn't hit it

562
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,470
it'll still be white now I just want to

563
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,240
take a few different chunky glitters

564
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,790
let's see oh I should do like little

565
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,380
star drips first huh I'm gonna grab my

566
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,209
liner brush and dip into the shade a

567
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,420
single and then I'm going to I guess

568
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,680
just like drip this down for a real one

569
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,080
I'm gonna take a little bit of brother

570
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,089
he's not same little brush now I'm gonna

571
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,170
pop on some glitter okay so have a few

572
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,610
different chunky glitters that I'm gonna

573
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,140
use today and they're often the brand in

574
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,280
your dreams on insert I don't want to

575
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,720
tip that or it's gonna fall everywhere

576
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,070
I'm gonna die but they're super dope

577
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,270
when they have a lot of chunky glitter I

578
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,430
feel like for some reason chunky glitter

579
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,720
is like impossible to find but it's not

580
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,620
the only glitter that I ever used cuz

581
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,850
you guys are I hate glitter period so

582
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,020
we're gonna put it on I don't get to put

583
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,140
it on using the peaches and glitter

584
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,140
adhesive

585
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,960
lots of filing at least I have a few of

586
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,309
these tiny little stars there's I do not

587
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,270
know how far I can tell that before it's

588
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,309
gonna fall

589
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,930
but they're shaped like stars I promise

590
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:54,250
thank you to my sister Burrell Co for

591
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,690
letting me borrow them could I go all

592
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,370
these little stars on to the bottom of

593
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,620
each little like drip as if they're like

594
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,870
stars that have fallen out of the sky so

595
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,660
cute oh my god so that is what I all

596
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,920
complete it I am obsessed with this this

597
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,350
is literally one of my favorite looks I

598
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,510
have ever ever done and it's also one of

599
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,100
the longest times I've ever spent on an

600
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,390
eye I'm gonna quickly cut and go off

601
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,610
camera to the other eye and hopefully

602
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,260
not take four hours and I'll be right

603
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,150
back with the finished look okay so

604
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,830
alright doc I decided on the other eye

605
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,660
off-camera this did in fact take me

606
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,610
another several hours which is just

607
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,650
lovely but it's done and that's all that

608
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,120
matters and I feel so beautiful I just

609
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,830
popped on a pair of Lily lashes in this

610
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,750

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,070
of the face for the highly unscientific

614
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,929
my face a quick spread of the more via

615
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,700
prep insect siding spray this is my

616
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:41,140

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,970
the shade of face from the palette and

618
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,140
then just grabbing literally on a knee

619
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,460
for brush you guys thought this my

620
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,740
all-time favorite combination and

621
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,530
putting this right over top just to mix

622
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,420
the highlight and blush together finally

623
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,710
for lips might go to a nude combination

624
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,330
and then just topping it off with some

625
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,470
gloss and finally finishing this look

626
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,050
off of the mac fix+

627
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:11,770
gold late edition for a little inner

628
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:13,809
glow okay I know literally four hours

629
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,300
later this is look number two inspired

630
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:17,620
by sister Lauren battles all complete I

631
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,880
went to this lips today knowing it was

632
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,820
gonna be challenging and it definitely

633
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,620
was but it took so much longer than

634
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,550
expected now you guys know I love it

635
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,920
just sitting down and playing with

636
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,929
makeup but this took us so much time in

637
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,429
patience and precision cutting this

638
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:31,870
crease making sure all the whites and

639
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:34,390
all the closure blended together but

640
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,340
that being said literally four hours of

641
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,650
work later I think every single bit of

642
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,330
that was worth it because I am obsessed

643
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,740
with how this lecture now I think it is

644
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,330
literally one of the most beautiful

645
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,140
looks I have ever had on my face like

646
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,299

further ado let's move on to the next

660
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,790
one

661
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,100
alright so finally on to the last look

662
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,420
of the video and I'm a little bit

663
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,010
nervous with this one I'm not gonna lie

664
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,390
I'm assuming if you saw the thumbnail

665
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,070
this is probably what you clicked on

666
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,429
this video which is why I kept it for

667
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,690
last

668
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,309
queen of marketing I'm gonna be

669
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,630
recruiting this look today from LA via

670
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:21,610
done prints one of my really good

671
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,559
friends Jose Jose is an incredibly

672
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,510
talented makeup artists but also truly

673
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:26,320
one of the nicest influencers I have

674
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,000
ever met

675
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,919
to this tank such a sweetheart I

676
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,049
absolutely love him the most but that

677
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,210
being said I am very very nervous for

678
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,410
this look that I am because this whole

679
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,600
makeup look is actually inspired by a

680
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,160
Marcelo con to photo who is an iconic

681
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,260
photographer now if you're not familiar

682
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,820
with like makeup community history this

683
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,790
whole look and effect actually went

684
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,350
viral several years ago by a photo edit

685
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,000
that Marcelo con 2 did know I've

686
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,860
actually shot with him before his work

687
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,660
is literally insane one of the coolest

688
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,220
photographers of all time and he's very

689
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,260
very known for doing it digital effects

690
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,059
now I know for a fact that this original

691
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,270
photo that Marcelo did it was completely

692
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:02,919
added it on and Jose did it with makeup

693
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,270
and what I saw Marcelo's photo a few

694
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,830
years ago I've always wanted to recreate

695
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,270
it but I just generally never thought it

696
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,400
would be possible using makeup because

697
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,200
the colors are so vibrant but sister

698
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,030
Hosea managed to do and to make it even

699
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,650
better he used my palette so I figured

700
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,210
for the last look today I would try my

701
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,309
absolute best to recreate this if it

702
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,260
turns out great amazing if it turns out

703
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:21,280
god at least it's the last look and you

704
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,770
guys would have already clicked off the

705
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,929
video early on ok so I think looking at

706
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,360
this photo and also at this really great

707
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:30,549
condition to charles palette i think i

708
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,419
want to start with the highlights and

709
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:33,760
kind of build

710
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:35,440
backwards with the colors ok so I think

711
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,790
our first thing I got my own 433 brush

712
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,850
and open to the shade of playground

713
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,950
which is this like teal blue

714
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,600
um this is this is my better side just

715
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,639
gonna put this like right oh my gosh

716
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,870
who's no going back now

717
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:47,309
then I'm gonna bring it like up to the

718
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,960
nose but I'm not gonna do is start

719
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:50,759
freaking out okay we're gonna make this

720
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,980
positive and I need some more up here

721
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,590
too I'm gonna layer obviously a lot more

722
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,820
on but I think this is a good start now

723
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,070
I'm gonna grab another M for three three

724
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,889
and dip into the shade single and I'm

725
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,049
gonna use this like below the blues so

726
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:07,500
like right here maybe you're gonna have

727
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:09,240
a little bit of a brother on a M 5:19

728
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,279
news up to kind of blend together the

729
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,570
blue and purple I'm just placing colors

730
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,370
on here randomly so I don't even know if

731
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,809
this is supposed to the K your tutorial

732
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,970
or what's going on I'm assuming there's

733
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:19,620
gonna be a lot of phase two needed to

734
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,360
like bring this to life you know what

735
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,429
that's okay you know I do love I got a

736
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,830
face to the moment I am the queen of

737
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,460
Phase two so you can definitely make it

738
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,960
work

739
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,389
I didn't that brother shade in between a

740
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,289
playground and a single definitely makes

741
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:37,019
it look way way way better but still not

742
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:38,250
good oh I forgot my brow bone I'll do

743
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:40,230
that in a second okay I need to put more

744
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,659
things here I've done some single up

745
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,909
here next to the blue can add a little

746
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:46,620
more purple here I'm gonna go to the

747
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:49,080
shade love that and a little bit more of

748
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:53,070
a fluffy brush and use this to not blend

749
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,379
out the edges of that purple oh yes yes

750
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,909
cess the chief just called and this this

751
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:59,460
is that that was so annoying a little

752
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:00,659
bit of love that in the inner nose area

753
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,250
I feel like during these videos and

754
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,629
these table looks they always get super

755
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,559
super discouraged when it doesn't look

756
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:09,330
perfect right away but in the end

757
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,769
usually happy with that right now

758
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,929
definitely at that stage where it looks

759
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:14,460
not good I'm not going to give up and

760
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,990
hopefully it looks okay by the time that

761
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,919
I finish this at this point I think

762
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,389
that's gonna be out anything that's

763
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,639
gonna say this look it's going to be the

764
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:22,500
highlight and like the white so I'm

765
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:23,610
gonna grab an M at four five six and the

766
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,139
shade hello

767
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,940
there's like the bright metallic I see a

768
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:29,340
baby blue from the pellets I'm gonna

769
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,480
give it a nice spread of some puppets up

770
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,179
because I definitely do you want this to

771
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,519
be like very very metallic and I'm gonna

772
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,690
start placing this color on the high

773
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,950
points

774
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,629
this is kind of coming together they're

775
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,419
not gonna lie gonna pop a little bit of

776
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:44,820
hello right on that inner corner on the

777
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:48,090
tip of the nose also down the nose

778
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,159
bridge and on the brow bone as well now

779
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,450
I want to take another one of the m45

780
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,659
six brushes is different to the shade

781
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:57,119
ring light once I get that metallic

782
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,609
pearl I want to give that a spread of

783
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,559
prep inside and put that like even more

784
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:02,099
in the middle this is exactly what we

785
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,359
need okay

786
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,239
oh I should definitely some on my ear

787
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,009
mm-hmm definitely in my ear and Jose's

788
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:10,559
personal photo he does have a winged

789
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:12,629
liner on now I fully already have lashes

790
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,129
on because I was too lazy to take them

791
00:24:12,629 --> 00:24:15,570
off before I started this look for some

792
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:16,979
reason and now I'm gonna be really lazy

793
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,049
I'm gonna try to do my wing liner over

794
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:19,229
top of my lash days is this going to

795
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:21,749
work

796
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:27,960
probably not am I going to try

797
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:29,009
absolutely oh my god I am the queen of

798
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,440
savings time

799
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,330
look at that wing you oh my god I would

800
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,789
normally literally never do waiting this

801
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:37,739
thick but Jose's wing was large and in

802
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:39,299
charge today gal so we're gonna match it

803
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:40,019
I'll do it on the other eye too even

804
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,639
though there isn't gonna be anything

805
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,139
over there I guess then I just make my

806
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:47,009
Wayne die literally literally perfectly

807
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:48,599
even I'd like to and Jose's virginal

808
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:50,700
look he does have the lower lashline

809
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,379
smoked out with block you guys know I

810
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,749
don't really like putting block on my

811
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:56,099
waterline but we are going to do it

812
00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:57,869
today I'm gonna dip into the shade of

813
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:04,679
spooky on my time at 5:08 brush and just

814
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:05,789
go right in there oh my god I should

815
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,899
have just left that how it was

816
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:11,639
oh I'm gonna use the Urban Decay glide

817
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:13,669
on pencil in the shade at zero which is

818
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:15,799
the block when I put this in my

819
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:17,269
I guess last I'm gonna pop on a black

820
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:18,950
line with lipstick this is Oprah in the

821
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:20,929
shade of the Bronx whose coach a misters

822
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,969
30% off whenever I do black lips I have

823
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:35,509
the tendency to over line them way too

824
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:37,219
much oh that is not good mascara all

825
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:39,169
right you guys I think this is the final

826
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:42,379
look final of be done print inspired by

827
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:43,999
Marcelo con tu foto all complete I'm

828
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:45,349
really not sure how much better I can

829
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:47,239
get this to look up considering the

830
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:49,309
original was not even actual makeup and

831
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:50,539
it was a digitally edited photo where

832
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:53,019
literally anything is possible

833
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:56,029
considering that I think we did okay

834
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:57,440
today I think it looks definitely decent

835
00:25:56,029 --> 00:26:00,559
with a little bit of facetune though

836
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,609
this will be good and fresh and with all

837
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,070
that being said I think those are all

838
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:05,509
three looks all complete I really hope

839
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,359
you guys enjoyed watching me a recreate

840
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:09,950
or at least try to recreate these three

841
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,929
makeup looks on my face today

842
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,279
oh my god when I saw these three looks

843
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:14,959
from the original artist I was so

844
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,549
excited and I just wanted to play and

845
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:18,259
sit down with the palette which is

846
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:20,209
exactly the point of why I made this in

847
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,619
the first place these artists blew my

848
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:23,209
mind and even if the last look didn't

849
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:24,799
exactly come out quite as planned I

850
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:26,719
definitely had so much fun challenging

851
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,070
myself tonight and I felt equally it's

852
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,359
beautiful in all three looks

853
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,829
