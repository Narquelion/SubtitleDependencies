00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,840
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,310
welcome back to my youtube channel so it

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,810
is officially October I am so excited

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,970
for the fall and for all the cute little

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,219
pumpkin spice lattes and sweaters but

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,780
most importantly I don't care what day

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,599
of the month it is this month is

8
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,100
Halloween the entire bar I definitely

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,449
plan on doing a ton of different

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,710
Halloween looks for you guys so

11
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,779
definitely make comment down below and

12
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,359
tell me what you want to see me do for

13
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,119
this Halloween but for today's look our

14
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,830
very first one I did this half face neon

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,929
light up skull inspired makeup look and

16
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,910
I am honestly it's so so hard to be how

17
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,520
it turned out I think it just looked so

18
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,840
so sick it definitely was not the

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,309
easiest makeup look I've never done it

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,500
took a very long time and a lot of

21
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,480
concentration but I feel like it's not

22
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,190
that hard you just have to be a really

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,320
really patient and be willing to take

24
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,510
your time - something that I definitely

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,860
struggle with but hey we came with okay

26
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,510
today by the waves today's look is

27
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,879
inspired by the wigs and makeup manager

28
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,590
on Instagram she does so many beautiful

29
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,090
and stunning skeleton makeup books do

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,710
you guys have to check her out all right

31
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,120
all that being said happy Halloween

32
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,150
everybody grab your Piketty drink at

33
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,380
ease and let's get started

34
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,380
[Music]

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,360
alright guys so I already went ahead and

36
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,890
I primed my face off-camera as always

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,150
using my favorite moisturizer but before

38
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,920
we actually go in with the makeup I want

39
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,390
to pry my lips and for today's video I

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,920
partnered with Yoos to show you guys

41
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,600
their brand new crystal lip balm

42
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,979
basically this lip balm acts as like a

43
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,780
moisturizing primer underneath the

44
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,549
makeup and it just wax for you so it

45
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,750
feels super super lately on the lips

46
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,400
which is great because we're gonna be

47
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,720
putting a lot of makeup on today so we

48
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,640
don't want it to feel very very heavy

49
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,930
and it also can needs a lot of natural

50
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,909
ingredients like shea butter and coconut

51
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,369
oil which makes for a really really long

52
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,110
lasting hydrating feeling which is so so

53
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,340
good like I said everybody putting on a

54
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,720
lot of face paint and

55
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,460
and liner onto my lips today which is

56
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,799
not saying that I normally do and it

57
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,030
tends to get really really really dry so

58
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,650
this is just gonna make sure those lips

59
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,330
last all day long and are super super

60
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,860
comfortable to wear so now that we are

61
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,960
all primed and ready to go like I said

62
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,180
we were gonna be wearing a lot a lot a

63
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,590
lot of makeup today so I'm gonna quickly

64
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,909
go ahead and do my base up camera as

65
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,050
well as my eyebrows to save some time

66
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,970
and then I'll be right back to sur off

67
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,649
the eyes okay so jumping bright and I

68
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,909
have my base already completely on it

69
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,470
this video is obviously gonna be focused

70
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,149
on the eye makeup and the skeleton

71
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,920
portion so I figured might as well just

72
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,840
save some time and for my eyes today I'm

73
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,360
gonna start off using my morphe 35o

74
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,860
palette I use this palette so much in

75
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,080
all my videos you guys have heard me say

76
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,400
this a million times but it is surely my

77
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,600
all-time favorite palette for a color

78
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,370
looks and I'm gonna be using all these

79
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,780
of blue shades in the left-hand row I'm

80
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,550
gonna start off by carving an M 4-3-3

81
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,560
bet and typing into this light blue

82
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,360
shade up in here and use that to start a

83
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,160
transition shade I'm going in with a

84
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,170
very very light hand because a blue eye

85
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,150
shadow does tend to be very hard to

86
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,000
blend out and I do want this to look

87
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,350
good obviously I mean duh so I'm just

88
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
gonna blend this very very carefully

89
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,459
making sure that this doesn't get too

90
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,019
high up into like the brow increase

91
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,180
region and just keeping the shadow

92
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,829
mostly concentrated in the crease I am

93
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,450
taking what's left of that shadow on the

94
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:50,280
brush and just winging it out as well

95
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,540
there's obviously gonna be a lot going

96
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,130
on in the mouth region with all the

97
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,810
skeleton makeup so I definitely make

98
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,670
sure it's balanced on the eye portion

99
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,989
and this is gonna be a lot of dimension

100
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,519
a lot of different colors going on it so

101
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,380
I feel like weighing this out and making

102
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,000
the shadows really really blown out and

103
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,260
wide with a lot of different shades and

104
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,150
dimension is just going to like really

105
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,130
even off this low neck so I'm gonna grab

106
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,170
an AB 5:07 brush and dip into this

107
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,150
darker blue shade in the top left hand

108
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,810
and use that to darken up the crease in

109
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,810
the outer corner

110
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,460
then I'm just gonna grab my own 4-3-3

111
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,170
that I had that light blue shade on and

112
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,880
use this to lightly buff over those

113
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,190
edges make sure everything is super

114
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,570
blended out copy that same M 507 brush

115
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,160
that I used for this blue I'm gonna dip

116
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,200
into this darker blue shade in the

117
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,580
bottom and use this to deepen it up even

118
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,900
more at this point you guys have low

119
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,400
base you may do a million half cut

120
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,690
creases I was reading through this

121
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,220
pretty quickly just because there is

122
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,960
gonna be a lot of work and color going

123
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,270
into the bottom half of the face being

124
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,950
the skull so just follow along the best

125
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,840
you possibly can or watch another two

126
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,880
turtle on a half cup crease I'm

127
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,770
basically just doing a full on blue one

128
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,810
and then guard my M 506 I'm gonna dip

129
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,060
into the slightest bit of black from the

130
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,400
bottom of the palette and I mean slight

131
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,510
you need to be so careful here can't

132
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,190
even tell you how many times I've messed

133
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,080
up an entire look with black shadow so

134
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,670
only grab a little bit and then once

135
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,100
again going with the next darkest blue

136
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,600
shade and using that to blend it oh now

137
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,250
that the shadows are all laid out and

138
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
blended and decide now I am so happy

139
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,040
because the blue shadows for me are

140
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,740
usually really really tricky but today

141
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,060
this looks so good and blended so thank

142
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,760
God the makeup cards are in my paper

143
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,169
today but moving on normally to cut my

144
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,180
crease I would use my a tarp shaped a

145
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:23,120
concealer as all of you guys know but

146
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,500
that has a tan base obviously so instead

147
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,270
I'm gonna use my Kat Von D lock-it

148
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,250
concealer in the shade whiteout today

149
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,780
just because I want this a cut crease to

150
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,220
be like white as opposed to like a tan

151
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,030
color so you can overlay it with a

152
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,030
glitter in a second

153
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,960
and then I'm just going to set that

154
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,000
concealer in place using my sugar pill

155
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,470
single shadow in the shade taco and then

156
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,560
finally for an extra pop I'm gonna grab

157
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,090
my Mac reflux teal and my morphe M two

158
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,310
to four brush and I'm gonna spritz it

159
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,750
using some fix+ and then pack a little

160
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,670
bit of this on to the later purchase a

161
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,740
nice pop of blue for the lower lash then

162
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,630
I'm gonna grab at 5:07 and dip into the

163
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,850
medium blue shade in the top and just

164
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,290
start to buff out the lower lash you

165
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,060
guys always know when it comes to doing

166
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,920
a half cut creases I always like to

167
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,200
bring this shadow in the very inner

168
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,550
corner on the lower lash line forward as

169
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,040
opposed to following my natural eye

170
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,630
shape this is a very drag technique but

171
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,300
I love how it makes my eyes look a lot

172
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,530
more open and wide driving my original

173
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,690
I'm four three three brush I'm gonna use

174
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:21,610
this to buff out that bottom edge and

175
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,440
then finally I'm gonna grab an M 213 and

176
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,120
dip this in the absolute darkest blue

177
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,070
and then just push this right into the

178
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
lashes so that is what I all complete

179
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,430
obviously I'm gonna add a mascara and

180
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,750
lashes towards the end of the look but

181
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,580
everything else is gonna take me a

182
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,540
long-ass time and I don't want to have

183
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,300
to deal with these charcoal up wearing

184
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,140
lashes for the next several hours so I'm

185
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,490
gonna go ahead and do the other eye

186
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,900
off-camera quickly and I'll be right

187
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,760
back to start off the skeleton and then

188
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,710
we'll put on the lashes and stuff later

189
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,090
on now we get to move on to the fun part

190
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,220
of this tutorial and that is the half

191
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,930
base skeleton look next in occur have

192
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,070
any white eyeliner pencil this one is

193
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,270
from a morphe in the shade

194
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,070
coconut and I'm gonna start sketching

195
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,240
out the highlights of a skull

196
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,830
I have a picture pulled up on my phone

197
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,330
right here that I'm looking at a lot of

198
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,010
times when you do skeleton makeup you

199
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,810
usually start with black to do like the

200
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,280
shadows but instead today we're focusing

201
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,050
on the highlight so really make sure

202
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,460
your toning into the light and the

203
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,110
darkness up the photo to really make

204
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,760
sure we achieve this effect correctly

205
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,350
okay so my camera died and I didn't

206
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,660
catch it I mean imagine that we really

207
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,610
surprised at this point but what I did

208
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,260
is I started off with my two top front

209
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,450
teeth and sketched those in and then

210
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,010
just started out from there making my

211
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,260
teeth get smaller and smaller as I get

212
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,400
out to the molars out of the corner and

213
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,960
then I'm just gonna do the same exact

214
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,040
thing on my bottom lip and then taking a

215
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,750
break from the mouth from one second

216
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,750
then just gonna trace my cheekbone

217
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,050
if you make a mistake it's okay don't

218
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,490
worry about it that's why we're starting

219
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,260
off with this white eyeliner basically

220
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,670
this entire top line that I just made

221
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,080
was completely wrong so I'm just going

222
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,760
to grab my Beauty Blender and quickly

223
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,080
try to go over as best as I can

224
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,390
but it's gonna be hidden in a few

225
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,260
seconds anyway because of the shadow and

226
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,700
stuff that were gonna be putting on

227
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:55,920
there so I'm gonna go ahead and redraw

228
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:57,690
that now and then finally placing one

229
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,340
really long line to trace up my jawline

230
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,930
and yes I am definitely being a lot more

231
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,520
sharp and chiseled than normal

232
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,050
definitely does not hurt to fool the eye

233
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,800
a little bit then I'm gonna start to

234
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,660
sketch in my nose and then remember

235
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,250
normally I know when we do a skull we

236
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,080
usually focus on the shadows first being

237
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,610
in the Blackshades flat first today we

238
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,600
need to do the whites first just make

239
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,920
sure we get those highlights all in

240
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,960
place before we place the shadows later

241
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,280
on so just kind of think the opposite of

242
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,510
what you would normally sketch so I'm

243
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,670
just kind of sketching a white outline

244
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,080
of where the nose would normally be if

245
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,190
that makes sense now I'm just going to

246
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,990
quickly go ahead and mirror that same

247
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,430
exact white lines on the other side I

248
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,380
just went ahead and I drew out all the

249
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,790
lines and once again don't worry if it's

250
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,470
not perfect you can always fix anything

251
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,750
up with concealer and we're about to

252
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,430
blend the crap out of it anyway so this

253
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,680
is just to get a rough baseline but now

254
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,210
that everything is roughly on I'm gonna

255
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,370
remember three threes that I use for my

256
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,500
eye crease and back into my at 35 beat

257
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,380
palette you guessed it and dip into this

258
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,120
bright blue shade and serve to blend out

259
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,250
all those white lines I'm also gonna

260
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,900
grab a clean m5 13 brush or any big

261
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,490
fluffy brush and just go over those

262
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,380
edges to make sure they're not too

263
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,400
intense then I'm just gonna go ahead and

264
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,230
repeat this for literally every single

265
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,430
white line that I've already drawn okay

266
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,050
so this way we're looking absolutely

267
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,550
ridiculous trust me I know it's gonna

268
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,230
get better in a second don't worry

269
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,490
there's a lot of layering that needs to

270
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,230
really go into this look to make sure it

271
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,300
looks really really realistic what I'm

272
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,040
gonna do is grab a slightly domed hacker

273
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,320
brush into the same Indian blue shade

274
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,300
once again and I pack this on into the

275
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,920
same exact areas tracing over where

276
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,450
those white lines were originally and

277
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,670
this is just gonna help add a lot more

278
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,650
to bend into the white lines once we add

279
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,940
them in next I'm gonna do the same exact

280
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,010
thing on the nose and the teeth as well

281
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,320
but I'm gonna use my m14 and I'm just a

282
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,190
tiny fluffy pencil brush and said just

283
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,190
make sure it's more defined

284
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:39,620
okay so now that we have all the blue in

285
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:41,000
place next we're gonna go in with the

286
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,860
black and this is where we have to be

287
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,779
really really careful and really precise

288
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,060
or else is gonna start looking a really

289
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:49,100
messy and really wonky real fast I'm

290
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,660
gonna start out by Gary Miami 506 brush

291
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,149
which is that same brush we used in

292
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,560
black to deepen up the crease and I'm

293
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,529
gonna dip it right back into the black

294
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,440
with a 35 B I'm gonna start to really

295
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:08,570
lightly fill in these areas in between

296
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:09,680
the blue where there is no light what

297
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,110
I'm gonna do next grab ie

298
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,060
37 brush and dip once again into that

299
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,550
black shade and use this to add it to

300
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,199
mention into the teeth region because

301
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,610
using a faulty brush in there would be a

302
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:24,380
disaster alright and now that the block

303
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,360
is all in place I told you guys this is

304
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,100
gonna be a long one I'm gonna go Miami

305
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,110
five thirteen which is my blending brush

306
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,029
to blend that blue out and I'm gonna dip

307
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,860
this into the teal and I'm gonna get a

308
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,829
lot of it on there and I'm gonna go

309
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,890
right over top of those lines one more

310
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:41,300
time to blend together the blue and the

311
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,670
black this step is basically to

312
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,680
eliminate any tan skin left showing in

313
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,079
this region okay so now that we have the

314
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,399
black and blue in place finally our last

315
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:50,480
step is going to be to add the

316
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,399
highlights which makes this like

317
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,070
actually neon and today I'm gonna be

318
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,810
using the white mixed liquid liner I'm

319
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,240
gonna be super careful here because this

320
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,640
took a lot of time but all I'm gonna do

321
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,670
is just trace a thin white line right

322
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,019
over the center most bluest point of all

323
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,670
the blue lines and that's going to

324
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,670
create that neon sign effect

325
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,770
just for an action little touch because

326
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,510
at this point why not I'm gonna grab an

327
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,190
Emma for for one or just any fluffy

328
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:27,010
blending brush and dip the tiniest bit

329
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,690
into the Mac reflux teal spreads a

330
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,880
little bit of it with some fix+

331
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,940
and then just tap this pigment right

332
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,930
over top of those highlighted areas

333
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,610
finally to finish off the hook I'm gonna

334
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,620
pop on the new bounce of lashes in the

335
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:43,000
style dragon Lee and you can use code

336
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:44,800
James for 20% off all their lashes all

337
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,950
right sisters and that is this hot faced

338
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,510
neon skeleton makeup all complete I

339
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,890
