12
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,029
have a little bit of time between the

13
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,560

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,000

17
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:37,640

[Music]

19
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,620

23
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,089
do my eyebrows before everything else

24
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:50,190
whatever let's scoot well because you

25
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,119
guys really never ever do dot but I

26
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,320
thought it'd be easier to do when the

27
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,699
plane was like on the ground and like

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,159
not moving so this waited like tatcha

29
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,019
water cream to give myself some moisture

30
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,850
it is so tiny called what do we know

31
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:01,890
because getting it very very cold but I

32
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,869
freakin I love this time of year so much

33
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,670
because it's winter vibes slowly grows

34
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:07,380
chilly girls for foundation I've been

35
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,149
mixing together to what different

36
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,759
foundations and that is first the dior

37
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:15,179
air plush open opinion are you want to

38
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:19,380
use a narrow Saul's on planes is it

39
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:20,520
going to explode oh we're good okay okay

40
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,600
I've been using this one and then

41
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,920
obviously the to pay for this one you

42
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,929
guys knows my all-time favorite just

43
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,020
kind of mixing it the two together for a

44
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:29,140
nice contraction on the hog like this

45
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,650

covered a little bit of dragon candy

49
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,710
color corrector mama mama I thought I

50
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,390
would try to like use a few different

51
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,010
things than I receive because every time

52
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,450
I makeup I use the same [ __ ] which I'm

53
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,830
sure you guys are really bored of all

54
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,119

55
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,790
this that it will be uploaded but I do

56
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,460
know that we are filming this one day

57
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,900
after I announced my show that I am

58
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,280

59
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,350
just wanted to first of all say thank

60
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,020
you guys so much for all the love and

61
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,240
support about the show I was definitely

62
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,009
not prepared for the response that I got

63
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,860
I've only been working on this for a

64
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:10,269
really long time so in the world

65
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,470
no I guess just like seeing the whole

66
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:13,720
community like actually come together

67
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,610
like be excited or something was really

68
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,959
really exciting for me obviously a few

69
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,269
people even started uploading their

70
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,440
audition videos to YouTube which was a

71
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,610
crazy thing of all I thought it would

72
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,650
definitely changing a few days we will

73
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,630
to get ready but nope there's already

74
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,860
some lip videos they uploaded which just

75
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,209
is like literally the coolest thing ever

76
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,820
while this color does not match my neck

77
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,830
at all for once it looks to pay our moon

78
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,630
loves to say James your foundation is

79
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,870
way too yellow you

80
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,490
I always say no I actually really don't

81
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,660
think that looks like a [ __ ] beer

82
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,310
every single day and this is what

83
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,830
happens when I use a pink foundation

84
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,480
Tomic concealer and conceal this

85
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,380
lighting in this plane is done in oh my

86
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,720

88
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,660

89
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:59,790
my forehead because this whole dinner

90
00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:03,100
situation oh no this is not good

91
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,820
what oh my god this is the fastest night

92
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,380
of my entire life

93
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,610
I wanted to do like a full eye shadow

94
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,620
luck what this way is going away faster

95
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,880
than anticipated which I have spooked

96
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,930
about okay so we're gonna try to do two

97
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,120
eye shadow look with the mini palette

98
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,460
super super fast in my reveal video for

99
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,020
the series I had on a neutral Brown like

100
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,600
just matte look which I have never done

101
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,100
before but I literally was obsessed at

102
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,540
how I looked and I felt so beautiful and

103
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,340
I actually got a lot of comments on it

104
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,510
to it which made me really happy so I

105
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,070
wanted to do like a very similar look

106
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,470
today so I'm gonna grab a little bit of

107
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,420
a team on an m4 33 brush I'm gonna put

108
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,250
this in my outer corner just like pocket

109
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,390
into here and there's gonna pull that

110
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,160
into the crease just like this then I'm

111
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,080
gonna go back into that same brush from

112
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,190
before and a little bit more of punch me

113
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,930
honestly I'm gonna get a little bit of

114
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,280
hoola bronzer as well so it like kind of

115
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,820
warms it up a little bit I was going to

116
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,820
buff out that

117
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,170
well I think this is the worst eye

118
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,640
makeup has ever lock I'm so scared

119
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,290
what's going on right now I'm gonna try

120
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,030
to cut my crease now a little bit of

121
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,450
concealer which I'm scared for because

122
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,920
we're on a moving vehicle a vehicle I'm

123
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,480
grabbing the shade of canvas on another

124
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,580
fluffy brush I'm just gonna use this to

125
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,890
holding up her landing I feel nauseous

126
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:17,269

127
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,680

129
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:39,560
of Flash stock onto my legs oh no what

makeup is clearly not yet complete this

137
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:12,080
is probably the worst idea that I've

138
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,180

139
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,050

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,740
palette but instead I'm gonna be using a

185
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,180
a brand new thing that just launched

186
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,680
that is the Dhokla cosmetics highlight

187
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,090
our palette and this one is the flash

188
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,980
she just launched her holiday collection

189
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,850
and I'm honestly very excited for it if

190
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,650
we're being honest I feel like

191
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,270
highlighters are cliche at this point

192
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,919
like every single brand has a 50,000 of

193
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,720
them but watching Jacqueline's video I

194
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,919
was honestly very excited to try it a

195
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,690
lot of it especially the illuminating

196
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,700
powder which I put in my setting powder

197
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,230
today it that spilled a little plain so

198
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,150
didn't even get to really try it out but

199
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,550
I do have this palette it did not go

200
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,020
over the plain and that's it and see how

201
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,850
it is I'm just gonna grab actually I'll

202
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,530
use like her just a little brush gonna

203
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,960
grab a little bit of a gleam on this

204
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,520
brush wait let me feel oh I feel so

205
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,780
buttery Wow okay that's a beautiful

206
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,000
formula let's have a little bit of gleam

207
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,650
on this brush and hold it on the chin

208
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,490
that'll get on the brow bone area as

209
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,979
always oh wow there we go oh my gosh

210
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:38,130
that is the lighting that I needed oh

211
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:39,120
that looks gorgeous oh my god alright

212
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,050
you guys so pretty much all I have left

213
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,370
of this makeup look it's going through

214
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,200
the lips but since we woke up with the

215
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,419
ass crack of dawn I have not got a

216
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,290
chance to eat yet and we happen to be

217
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,120
right next door to my favorite

218
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,770
restaurant of literally all time not

219
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,210
sponsored but really wish it was the

220
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,590
pains literally Daenerys Keens to where

221
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,300
I live in California is over an hour

222
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,470
away and my friends and I drive all the

223
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,390
time because it is literally that good

224
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,890
so while we were here we're going to

225
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,530
indulge cuz some chicken tenders fries

226
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,270
and Texas toast or Vegas toast this is

227
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,860
now a law instead of just a cheque or

228
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,760
anything so let's come along for the day

229
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,170
all right

230
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,700
here's the goodies homework shaking

231
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,590
because I haven't eaten yet so whoop

232
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,670
aunt I'm just kidding but I did want to

233
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,140
tell you guys what I get it canes every

234
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,460
time I was to the three-finger combo

235
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,580
because you get three chicken tenders

236
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:23,670
and fries and a piece of Texas oats now

237
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:27,990
this cans host is literally it's like

238
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:34,920
sweet and salty at the same time that's

239
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:36,690
alone this alone makes it just also the

240
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,100
Box combo where you get four titers

241
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,960
instead of three and then you get

242
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,090
coleslaw but that's [ __ ] disgusting I

243
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,980
feel like close all your people and then

244
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:48,100
you do two pieces of toast instead of

245
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,100
[Music]

246
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,310
okay you guys so the look is all

247
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,020
complete I this is my lips off camera

248
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,220
after eating canes because it was quite

249
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,780
the situation and now that the look is

250
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,980
all gone gonna lock my face in place a

251
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,180
long time these know if it happens that

252
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,050
setting spray and then it's gonna use a

253
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:16,260
little bit of a mac fix+ and go bite to

254
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,490

changed because I'm doing a

258
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,540
meet-and-greet looking like this would

259
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,520
be a little bit crusted illegal I agree

260
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,550

261
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,910
