26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,190
stuff that we've learned from our

27
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,469
experience dating in the beauty world

28
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,039
and all that type of stuff I have a

29
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,410
confession

30
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,399
what this is only the second time

31
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,280
anyone's ever done my makeup what oh my

32
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,049
god oh my god this is so exciting so I

33
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,640
put together this look on Amanda's face

34
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,340
today any killing it we came up with

35
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,020
this cut crease chartreuse liner type

36
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,400
situation we really want to just think

37
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,330
out of Amanda's comfort zone she does

38
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,010
tend to wear a lot of very very

39
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,479
beautiful and like glam natural style

40
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,320
makeup but I really wanted to like for

41
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,509
sure and do something that she would

42
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,250
never normally do bolt them in and I had

43
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,630
very very straight brow shape and she

44
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,250
said that creases are not saying that

45
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,110
she ever does so of course that's what I

46
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,430
put on her face today that's looks so so

47
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,020

48
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,250

so Mays row nation today we're using of

60
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,590
course my holy girl and apparently this

61
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,479
is Amanda's too because she brought it a

62
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,880
makeup ever Ultra HD foundation shake in

63
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,750
the shade why 2:45 I was hoping it would

64
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,450
be Y 315 that's what I should

65
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,300
I go by the number of mines 120 I don't

66
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,490
know donation is the best I've liked

67
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,930
everyone so miss Amanda do you have a

68
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,720
new man in your life I do

69
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,490
so I started dating someone about 7

70
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,560
months ago actually did every week it's

71
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,500
been 7 months I was in a relationship

72
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,480
for such a long time that you get so

73
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,100
guarded it's so hard to let someone back

74
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,230
into your life and your social media

75
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,730
your followers like people who watch

76
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,950
your videos they're your family so I

77
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,050
don't just show them anybody right so

78
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,570
and I wanted like time to be with myself

79
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,150
and work out myself and then we met just

80
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,190
randomly like at a Halloween party and I

81
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,780
was like I wouldn't date him that we

82
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,130
were friends for a while and then it

83
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,840
just like happens to me at least expect

84
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,950
it yeah those of you guys who don't know

85
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,510
if you follow me on Twitter or snapchat

86
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,060
you know that I get myself into boy

87
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,380
drama quite often like it really excited

88
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,240
over like a straight guy and then I get

89
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,770
my heart hurt for no reason when I had

90
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,840
no chance in the furnace place I'm very

91
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,650
very bad knocking this but recently

92
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,600
however I've been getting myself

93
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,910
involved a lot of like guys so we're

94
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,720
kind of on the DL or more like closeted

95
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,890
or not really kinda rolled their

96
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,780
sexuality but at the same time like

97
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,190
still are talking to you which is fine

98
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,120
but at the same time it's like it's a

99
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,590
lot to deal with in it's something

100
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,300
that's very very powerful just because

101
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,430
like I'm so open and comfortable myself

102
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,570
it's totally okay but it's frustrating

103
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,410
for me at the same time and it's saying

104
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,530
that I don't really know how to handle

105
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,660
and and I have had to sell money like

106
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,160
late night like two hour-long FaceTime

107
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,230
calls where she's just like listen James

108
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,510
get your together but like oh my

109
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,970
gosh she's been like my see it's really

110
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,080
not your fault like I mean you have to

111
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,519
keep yourself guarded right and it's

112
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,769
hard because you wanna believe that

113
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,030
someone's nice and they're so nice at

114
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,230
first and everything's great like how

115
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,260
could it go wrong and then they're

116
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,910
immature or it's I mean I can't relate

117
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,260
to the closet thing obviously because I

118
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,580
haven't been with that but I just have

119
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,930
one of my best friends and he deals with

120
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,950
that too and it just sucks because it's

121
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,000
like okay well then what are you doing

122
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,830
like I'm not something you can hide

123
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,959
right like if you're with me or with me

124
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,670
like I want a normal relationship and

125
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,470
you deserve that but you deserve so much

126
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,730
better and like I've told you like it'll

127
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,410
weed out all the bad ones to try to

128
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,940
waste your time but when I first moved

129
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,840
to LA I didn't go on a date for a while

130
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,870
I think I only went on a couple

131
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,370
and they were not good and it was just

132
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,050
like I wish I could like write a book or

133
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:13,340
like do like story time videos on all

134
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:14,630
the stuff that would happen I don't know

135
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,459
I how many things that would get I know

136
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,320
but I feel like a lot of them still

137
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,519
watch my stuff which is super weird and

138
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,169
I don't get them it's like they don't

139
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,400
want you but then they don't like don't

140
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,540
want you to move on as anybody thought

141
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,040
for a reason though when I look at all

142
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,200
the relation to work out I'm like no no

143
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,280
I'm happy that it didn't work out hmm

144
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,110
that's one thing they would be every

145
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,130
time I've like got into like a weird

146
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,410
thing where I've like called you at like

147
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:38,090

rose-colored glasses on or something

151
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,310
because they seem so amazing and you put

152
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,500

like they know it I don't know what it

175
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,090

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,890
so ugly I don't even know we're gonna

198
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,820
Amanda's face make for a few minutes now

199
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,340
while we do that we're gonna move right

200
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,700
on to it the eyebrows those are a pair

201
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:32,270
of bras right there so people ask you

202
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:33,470
like wine growing recently do so much

203
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:37,070
with them I feel like my forehead is so

204
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,120
big to it five to you

205
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,650
we're gonna take a little bit of a cut

206
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,580
crease line or situation here on Amanda

207
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,440
so we're gonna be something off with

208
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:47,140
deep morphe 35o palette and once again

209
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,140
code james or code amanda for 10% off

210
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,990
I'm gonna start off by grabbing this

211
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,669
liner brush from the morphe rolls gold

212
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,890
collection and dip into this warm brown

213
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:56,870
shade right up in here so Amanda's

214
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,909
latest face is very very similar to mine

215
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,370
in the fact that we both have a pretty

216
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:02,630
straight brow shapes and not much like

217
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,280
the way when you actually open your eye

218
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,200
so I'm gonna have to do a little bit of

219
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,780
a low cut crease here but that's totally

220
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,909
okay and it will doubly look regardless

221
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,620
there just won't be a lot of like space

222
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:15,409
to blend but we're gonna make it work

223
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,849
as always I'm gonna grab this morphe r39

224
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:18,050
brush and dip into this light warm shade

225
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,550
right here and I'm gonna blend out that

226
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,169
light a little bit how do you do your

227
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,580
cut creases do you like start off by a

228
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,990
blending a lot together then deepening

229
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,880
and then cutting it with concealer

230
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,620
yeah usually I'll blend everything and

231
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,890
then I'll go in with like Paint Pot or

232
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,180
concealer and then carve it out okay cuz

233
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,440
I do my cut crease is in a really really

234
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,960
different way I will actually like start

235
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,450
off by drawing the bottom line and then

236
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,159
just blend upwards which I've never seen

237
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,210
anybody else do it that way but I feel

238
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,469
like that gives me like a really really

239
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,390
clean that's smart

240
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:45,710
crease I don't know if you are someone

241
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,849
if you're definite like wanting to do

242
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,020
more cut creases you should try it out

243
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,419
let me know like how it works

244
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,860
yeah angled brush first yeah that's

245
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,200
what's always worked for me I like that

246
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,180
technique really really well I'm next to

247
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,950
grab my morphe M 213 and dip into this

248
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:02,469
warm up dark brown shade in the bottom

249
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,469
I'm just to deepen up the crease line

250
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,030
[Music]

251
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,170
an understanding of this Anasazi a for

252
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,820
brush limit more of that shape tip

253
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,220
concealer just too hard out of the

254
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,170
crease this is also why I like starting

255
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,280
out with that line rather than just like

256
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,110
putting color on there and then cutting

257
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,210
it later because this kind of like gives

258
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,270
you a guide of where to like cut the

259
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,350
concealer as well it's like the crease

260
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,550
is basically does there you just need to

261
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,270
clean it up I guess yes do you do the

262
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,800
other way around

263
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,990
I need stupid and now I'm kind of

264
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,270

the bottom edge of the wing up blending

317
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,459

322
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,350
because it's a cut crease but then we

323
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:49,649
want the bottom to be like really really

324
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,300

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,259
