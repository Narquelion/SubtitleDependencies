00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,640
welcome back to our YouTube channel

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,010
today I'm done to the very special guest

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,500
BAE's rug I thought this is a club you

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,759
never thought you would see coming no me

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,139
either I know thank you

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,630
first today's video has something very

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,279
very plagued I obviously am in the

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,289
beauty community and Brian is in the

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,289
vlogging community but before he was a

11
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,769
blogger he was a gamer a full-time

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,720
gaming a nerd and I just feel like those

13
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,150
worlds are two opposites and right now

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,700
we're having likely opposites collide so

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,130
for today's video I'm gonna teach Brian

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,290
how to do my makeup and then after that

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,579
he's gonna teach me how to be

18
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,100
professional gamer and we're gonna face

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,280

me too even though we have virtually

22
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,710
nothing in common I think this will

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,969
probably be really really funny and a

24
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,200
definite awesome challenge

25
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,750

okay so now a bare face and ready to go

43
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,119
as you could see my face is looking a

44
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,890
little bit bad right now

45
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,810
I had a facial this morning my sister

46
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,759
Yoli glow popped all my pimples for me

47
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,040
just let you know beauty gurus can have

48
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,520
pimples 217 million layers of foundation

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,990
we are definitely far from perfect but

50
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,540
without further ado let's go ahead and

51
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,920
cover this up please let's do it

52
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,280
I got you so do you know what the first

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,680
step of this is going to be foundation

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,290
yeah really yeah okay there I don't

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,570
really know what foundation is but is it

56
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,140
this yeah no way yeah okay see I did

57
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,700
learn a thing or two from her

58
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,020
yeah I love that we just did a quick

59
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,640
sister switcheroo already yeah oh my god

60
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,050
okay so you're gonna want to pounce it

61
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,940
in as opposed to like rubbing it you

62
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,270
know like this yeah okay okay that looks

63
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,800
better

64
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,149
yeah all right all right so you're just

65
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,050
talking about how you broke out like

66
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:16,150
extremely bad do you know I'm not bad

67
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,890
but do you use makeup to like feel more

68
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,140
confident about her like just to hide in

69
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,940
stuff or yeah I actually wear makeup

70
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,770
like as an art makeup for me has never

71
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,180
been something as the way to like hide

72
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,560
insecurities or anything although I

73
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,670
definitely feel like really confident

74
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,440
and pretty where the full face that

75
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,060
makeup off for me I basically just wear

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,100
makeup like as an art form and to kind

77
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,050
of express myself I never really need it

78
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,480
to like feel pretty but I I mean like

79
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,310
definitely some people do yeah as like a

80
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,900
straight guy who's like dates girls

81
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,239
obviously what is your opinion on like

82
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,770
when girls wear makeup to me not to

83
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,630
sound cheesy at all like girls don't

84
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,489
need make-up to express how they look

85
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,989
but like if it's something like you said

86
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,940
like it's an art like if it's something

87
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,920
that they enjoy doing that of course

88
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,410
they're gonna do it if anything if

89
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,760
anyone is into makeup and passionate

90
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,590
about it like that just makes them more

91
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,320
attractive like their personality true

92
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,720
it is so true honestly after spending

93
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,910
the day with you like I've learned so

94
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,739
much about makeup and how it's really

95
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,230
not only about the looks like I swear

96
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,450
like it it it feels like I'm being

97
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,910
artistic now yeah it's weird like I love

98
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,080
it isn't it fun it is you want basically

99
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,519
all the comes to that are we focus on

100
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,370
the highlights of your face it's going

101
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,050
brightness and attention to the center

102
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,040
all right perfect

103
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,720
[Music]

104
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,540
okay so next time is gonna be our powder

105
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,239
so Brian is gonna use the Beauty Blender

106
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,680
it is going to dip it in and then he's

107
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,390
gonna set first I always start with

108
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,590
underneath my eyes okay cuz that's what

109
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:43,269
crease is first okay so I have a

110
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,880
question for you yeah you started on

111
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,709
YouTube I think five and a half years

112
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,019
ago now that's a little bit crazy but

113
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,549
you just turned 21 correct yeah okay so

114
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,430
me and Brian are really not that far off

115
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,560
age wise but you do vlogs correct yeah

116
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,180
now there's definitely been some drama

117
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,530
and the vlogging community of people

118
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,180
making a fool of themselves

119
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,820
I'm not gonna name any names here all

120
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,400
right was it strange for you as someone

121
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,930
who like shares our entire life

122
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,000
the Internet and obviously I do this as

123
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,530
well but to go from being a normal

124
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,390
everyday like high school student to all

125
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,489
of a sudden being watched by millions of

126
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,229
people and now considered a role model

127
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,850
honestly the transition from like not

128
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:20,790
being anything to becoming something is

129
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,229
a blessing first cuz like it's it's

130
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,540
insane that like this many people

131
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,790
actually want to watch my videos wanna

132
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,620
like stay updated with my life I never

133
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,350
really started to pop off until after

134
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,940
high school huh but honestly it's crazy

135
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,830
to me because I have a bunch of my old

136
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,330
friends that snapchat me to this day

137
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,280
like watching my videos and I'm like

138
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,020
that's so crazy that like that is weird

139
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,580
that they stick with my life that like

140
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,770
Emily we don't really talk that much but

141
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,570
like they still like like keep up with

142
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,419
my day to day life yeah okay so I was

143
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,190
doing my sister research on your channel

144
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,539
and I saw that you joined like I think

145
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,460
it was two years ago

146
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:55,080
mhm so it was not too long ago mm-hmm

147
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,460
how has that changed your life it's

148
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,990
definitely like a blessing to have so

149
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,070
many people like looking up to as like a

150
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,169
role model but I think that it's

151
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,580
definitely also a really scary thing as

152
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,750
well because like we never really knew

153
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,010
where we're gonna be like it's exact

154
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,840
five years ago you knew you're gonna be

155
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,160
like where you are now I felt like when

156
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,870
I first put on makeup I knew I was gonna

157
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,130
sign with carpet girl and yeah blow up

158
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,930
to where I am not like never in a

159
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,889
million years what I haven't imagined so

160
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,260
it's not like I really started doing

161
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,250
this to become like a role model yeah so

162
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,780
what all of sudden millions of people

163
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,970
are watching and I feel like you do

164
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,560
instantly get that tag as a role model

165
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,880
there's really nothing you could do to

166
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,139
kind of get rid of it we're gonna

167
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,599
contour our face using the Kat Von D

168
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,190
shade my palate right now but it's kind

169
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,990
of like a really really overwhelming

170
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,460
feeling to all the sudden how that many

171
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,229
people watching and looking up to I feel

172
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,669
like it's definitely like scary and you

173
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:37,610
obviously have to like be on your best

174
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:40,620
behavior and not make a really stupid

175
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,570
mistakes yeah of course many names yeah

176
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,639
I mean I myself have made tons and tons

177
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,470
and tons of mistakes my it's I think

178
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,610
it's really really awesome to like be a

179
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,960
role model for young people and get

180
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,729
people like watching you looking up to

181
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,300
you that placement is perfect really

182
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:55,889
okay and then just blend it in so the

183
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,960
point of contouring is basically like it

184
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,070
adds shadows to the face when you're

185
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,900
putting up there on my cheekbones

186
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,220
because it's like the very bottom my

187
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,500
cheekbone it makes it look like I have

188
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,820
like really snatched okay she phones

189
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,800
have that makes any sense no it does

190
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,449
it's looking really good right now

191
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
laughter I think I'm doing a good job

192
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:15,240
what do you guys think I love that

193
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,560
confidence yeah it looks pretty good so

194
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,129
basically with nose Kondo we're gonna be

195
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,409
putting

196
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:21,659
uline's on the side of my nose as

197
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:23,729
closely as possible so it looks really

198
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:25,830
really pinched okay does that make sense

199
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,939
no you don't want to follow the natural

200
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,099
shape in the nose that's kind of the

201
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:32,759
whole point you try to fake it oh oh

202
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:34,439
yeah our next one's gonna be to add a

203
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,539
little bit of blush before we move on to

204
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,729
the eyes and this goes on the apples of

205
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:44,849
my cheeks the apples like a nice smile

206
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:47,279
like do they look like

207
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:51,889
even definitely have a lot of color

208
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,889
going on our next one's gonna be to bake

209
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:58,110
definitely help me out yeah gonna take

210
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,240
the beauty run with a powder on it right

211
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,709
I'm gonna go right up against your nose

212
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,110
contour so right there all the way down

213
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:10,409
and see how that line is perfectly

214
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,409
parallel yeah yeah yeah on the other

215
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:18,779
side

216
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:20,039
perfect yeah so while we're baking in

217
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:28,499
the oven our next step is going to be

218
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:29,279
the eyebrows oh no we're on that level

219
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:31,919
yeah

220
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,079
oh hey not the worst I used to at aside

221
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,659
without brow no I'm gonna make this one

222
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,599
better don't give up on this one

223
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:40,949
always okay watch I can fix it yeah all

224
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,519
right all right I got this

225
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,689
I feel so concentrated it's ridiculous

226
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,369
I wanna show you how I would do this

227
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:48,779
yeah okay once you get to the tail

228
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:51,149
there's clearly like a lot going on over

229
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,189
here right now that's okay if you clean

230
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:55,199
it up so I'm gonna bring it out and then

231
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:57,329
up top also needs a little bit more

232
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,529
definition okay I'm gonna pull this up

233
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:00,529
right here and then bring it down

234
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:08,550
so has a nice arch and shape and then

235
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:13,740
I'm gonna go right under

236
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:17,580
[Music]

237
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:21,229
oh yeah come up the Little Miss I made

238
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,639
oh that actually looks good interesting

239
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:26,610
wait this one's hard like the eyes are

240
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,380
actually harder to do than the face yeah

241
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,080
yeah for sure okay so now the brows are

242
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,729
all complete next up it's going to be

243
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,050
the eye shadow yes first gonna dip into

244
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,360
like a light Warren shade us then we

245
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,000
called our transition color and that's

246
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,669
gonna go right in the eyelid and that

247
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,860
like makes everything blend really

248
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,800
nicely together okay and I'm gonna dip

249
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,230
into a more burnt orange shade and

250
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,899
that's going to go in the crease again

251
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,459
but it's gonna keep it more concentrated

252
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,510
so that's gonna add more dimension

253
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:00,540
there's no way I could possibly mess

254
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,830
this one up you'd be surprised I think

255
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,000
that same shader I'm gonna pack it on

256
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,770
like the outer portion of the lid I

257
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,910
don't dip into like this dark brown

258
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,620
shade right here and I'm pop that right

259
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:17,010
into the outer area of the violet so

260
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,500
right on that outer corner just like

261
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,350
that see okay I'm gonna grab this

262
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,810
shimmery shade up here I'm gonna spritz

263
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,480
it with a little bit of fix+

264
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,959
and by adding water to a shimmery shadow

265
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:35,760
it makes it more vibrant okay I'm gonna

266
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:39,270
pop that right on the inner corner and

267
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,870
hug it right up there that's good yeah

268
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:45,660
that actually does that fit and then

269
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,520
grab our eyeliner I'm gonna do a winged

270
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,279
liner with the one right here uh-huh

271
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:57,600
okay all right so like this I'm gonna

272
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:58,260
take a tiny line think you can recreate

273
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,500
that on the other eye

274
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,779
I can probably recreate like all this

275
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,160
like the first steps then this part

276
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,600
where I have to actually draw it I don't

277
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,910
think I'm gonna be able to do that no

278
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,579
that's true actually I'll make it better

279
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:15,380
that's the thought let's do it so you're

280
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:15,380
gonna hold that like this

281
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:25,029
that way I kind of went a little bit too

282
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,529
high okay so you can see that for yeah I

283
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:28,750
could see so in that case you're gonna

284
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,550
want to grab a clean brush and just go

285
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,620
over that edge to kind of make sure like

286
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,910
the color is diffused and that'll how we

287
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,899
make sure the colors like evenly

288
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,970
distribute everywhere

289
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:38,860
there aren't many rules to make up it's

290
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,930
a lot about self-expression but the

291
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,820
number one rule that is a rule is you

292
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,660
have to blend okay blend blend blend

293
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,040
blend blend

294
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,959
alright I'll keep that in mind there you

295
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,690
go okay so the way you're holding it

296
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,310
right now it's bad yeah hahaha since

297
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,420
you've got a little bit of makeup on the

298
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,050
side of the brush if you hold it like

299
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,550
this

300
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,010
not only is it putting it in the crease

301
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,720
but it's also putting it all up here -

302
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,889
because you're rubbing it on so when

303
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,540
you're applying I should especially when

304
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:02,800
you want to make it more defined you

305
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,050
want to make sure to hold it that brush

306
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,880
as parallel as possible so it's really

307
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,339
only getting the point

308
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,480
right in that crease or even lower so

309
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:11,740
sometimes you can get a little bit on

310
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,410
the lid but that's okay because you're

311
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,290
gonna cover up anyway - okay is this

312
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:21,120
like the the glam one okay so it's it's

313
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,120
this one right here no that one no

314
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:27,750
[Music]

315
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,880
you're ready for the winged liner oh man

316
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,130
my favorite part okay I'm ready for this

317
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,360
all right I used to take art class in um

318
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:38,870
sixth grade oh I got an F but Picasso is

319
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,870
Shh

320
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,179
[Music]

321
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,180
you ought to end to be as points at as

322
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:52,140
you can possibly get I try try let's see

323
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:54,660
if you could fix it up that is

324
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,790
definitely not fixable oh well she's

325
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,260
gonna be really thick so even if you

326
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,390
mess up you could just fix it with

327
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,280
concealer is that like the concealer is

328
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,450
like the go-to of the mix okay like when

329
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,640
you have a good concealer you're pretty

330
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:10,050
much unstoppable so if I go like this

331
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:12,090
ready I'll take my concealer there's

332
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,610
like to make it thinner kinda looks

333
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,920
great I think I did a great job on that

334
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,240
uh-huh if I have two glasses here these

335
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,440

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,650
basically want to put it right at my

340
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,690
eyelashes as close to like the lashline

341
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:45,330
as you can get then you want to make

342
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:47,670

I do something right love a good sister

345
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,000
eyelash application

346
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,410
[Music]

347
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,149
so while that was on your face they

348
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,680
didn't do anything yeah so basically

349
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,910
like leaving the powder on there for a

350
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,380
little while it kind of brightens

351
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,580
everything up so like I was telling you

352
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,930
how you put the contour to kind of

353
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,730
create those shadows yeah

354
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,709
the baking powder helps intensify the

355
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,870
highlights to just further the illusion

356
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:13,160
of like more chiseled features okay okay

357
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,480
so our next one's gonna be the

358
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,890
highlighter this is the one time where

359
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,750
you do want a lot of product on the

360
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,820
brush it off and then you're gonna put

361
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,110
it right on top of the cheekbone that

362
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,120
doesn't seem like something I can mess

363
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:26,899
up but we've said that about everything

364
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:38,990
see that glow oh that's nice give it a

365
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:41,060
little world this world huh yeah so good

366
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,760
okay okay so I also like to do

367
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,890
highlighting on my nose to make my nose

368
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,120
look nice and pinched so you want to

369
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,649
make sure to draw this smallest line you

370
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,820
possibly can right down the center cuz

371
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:56,660
that really creates like starting from

372
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:57,890
right here yeah mm-hmm perfect but this

373
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,420
is the liquid lipstick meeting goes on

374
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,520
obviously a liquid it has this little

375
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,860
doe foot applicator we like to call it

376
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,450
but it dries down a fully mapped like a

377
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,010
normal lipstick so you get like a little

378
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,200
bit of wiggle room so you're gonna go

379
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,270
ahead and apply this on me and I like to

380
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,490
over line a little bit only on the top

381
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,930
left so basically I go a little bit over

382
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,190
my natural lip line to make them look

383
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,440
nice and juicy

384
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,669
okay I got this

385
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,669
[Music]

386
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,880
as you can see I'm not like a good

387
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,590
tracer that was something I wasn't good

388
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,600
at as a kid so staying inside the lines

389
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,090
yeah I can tell

390
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:38,010
when in doubt when something goes wrong

391
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:39,990
conceal it yeah okay okay so we have one

392
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,880
final step which is gonna be to set our

393
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,190
face in place so it last through all the

394
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,260
sweat blood and tears it's about to go

395
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,730
down in our gaming session okay all

396
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,240
right

397
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:52,980
quick spritz when you do setting spray

398
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,680
it's really great to use like a pallet

399
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,180
or a fan to kind of Fanning the liquid

400
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,710
out for the back and that kind of makes

401
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,630
all the powders and stuff like meld

402
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,280
together and look more like skin as

403
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,930
opposed to okay a million products just

404
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,930

my brother but I remember before I would

505
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:11,250
leap out of the closet to him we'd be

506
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,110
planning on like Xbox Live and like

507
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,669

508
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,950

don't even know me

512
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:27,570
yeah it's so intact no I know that it

513
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,730
sucks yeah because like when people say

514
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,340
oh that's so gay they really mean to say

515
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,600
like oh this sucks you suck like I don't

516
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,519
think they need to say in an offensive

517
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,779
way but like some people just don't

518
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,350
realize what's coming out of their mouth

519
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:42,840
but I always remember like trying to be

520
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:45,419
in this like gaming world I guess but

521
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,129
like always instantly yeah because it's

522
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,529
like kind of tough when like people are

523
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:51,960
screaming out Gaelic every five seconds

524
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:53,879

525
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,470
people just say how the pinger okay I

526
00:20:53,879 --> 00:21:02,669

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,460
apocalypse being you

545
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,390
yeah sesame yeah okay all right sister

546
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,760
so that is all we have for this

547
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,650
challenge today I literally had so much

548
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,150
fun today even though like I said

549
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,490
earlier me and Bryan don't really have a

550
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,350
lot in common I think it was so cool to

551
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,120
kind of like trade places and see into

552
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,590
the other person's like industry and

553
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,580
what they really really loved to do we

554
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,710
were definitely brought together by a

555
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,920
strange Instagram live occurrence but

556
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm say never in a million years did I

557
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,300
think I'd be into makeup like that yeah

558
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,920
and like after today I kind of want to

559
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,020
actually go home and try to do my mom's

560
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,450
makeup I think years old I don't really

561
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,890
how devoted you were to it like you

562
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,290
really cared you took your time with

563
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,390
like thought was so cool it really is

564
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,040
like an art like yeah it's it's not just

565
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,220
makeup like you throw on makeup it's

566
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,780
like precision and like creativity

567
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,670
yeah it's stuff like that so like I

568
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,140
actually enjoyed it yeah and I never in

569
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,270
a million years expected to like be

570
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,730
playing freaking black ops or a

571
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,110
professional gamer but without one we

572
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,120
killed it we got so far

573
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,440
and it was really awesome to kind of

574
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,540
participate in a world that I was once

575
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,830
literally horrified out because of some

576
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,120
like the nasty comments and stuff but

577
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,560
you do have to understand that like

578
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,720
these are really really young kids yeah

579
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,100
are educated and exactly fingers crossed

580
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,480
they will find their cost and they

581
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,820
definitely what they're saying is

582
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,350
offensive sometimes but there's people

583
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,480
like you who are like leading a

584
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,920
community of people especially young

585
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,260
kids as well and you like teach them

586
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,000
right from wrong and that that's super

587
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,440
super awkward if you guys enjoyed
