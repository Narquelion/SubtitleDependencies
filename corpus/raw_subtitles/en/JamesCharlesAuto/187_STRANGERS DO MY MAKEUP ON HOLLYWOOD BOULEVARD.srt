00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,369
probably crazy I may be regretting this

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,320
on the end of it but I'm gonna have

9
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,850
strangers walking down the street do you

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,199

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,730

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,160

foundation if I'm breaking out once

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,050
