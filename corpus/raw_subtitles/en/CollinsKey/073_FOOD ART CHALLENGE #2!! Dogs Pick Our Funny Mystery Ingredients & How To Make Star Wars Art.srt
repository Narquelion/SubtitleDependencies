00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:04,069
(air whooshing) - We've got puppies because

4
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:06,134
you challenged us to do the ultimate food art challenge,

5
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:07,067
with these puppies who are going

6
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:08,324
to pick our food ingredients.

7
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,157
My guys name is Fluffy!

8
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:10,232

9
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:11,065

let's go for it!

13
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:14,628
- [Collins] I'm making an edible Pennywise,

14
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:15,464
so Fluffy's gonna be choosing

15
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:16,914
all the different food ingredients.

16
00:00:16,914 --> 00:00:18,623
- [Devan] And since I'm making an edible Frankenstein,

17
00:00:18,623 --> 00:00:20,682
Puffy's gonna be choosing all my foods.

18
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:21,515
Oh, avocado.

19
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:22,532
Green just like Frankenstein.

20
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:23,365
- [Collins] Pineapple!

21
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:24,846
Nice, that could be perfect for Penywise's brain.

22
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:25,997
- [Devan] Oh, flour nice.

23
00:00:25,997 --> 00:00:27,470
- [Collins] Agar Agar, okay solid.

24
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,786
- [Devan] Little handshake, nice to meet you.

25
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,124
- [Collins] He looks very comfortable right now.

26
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:30,957
- [Devan] Yeah.

27
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:31,790
Oh no, he wants to get away.

28
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,536
- [Collins] My man Fluffy, picking the berries!

29
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,914
- [Devan] I'm actually surprised he chose seaweed.

30
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:35,831
- [Collins] Yes, honeycomb!

31
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:36,664
- [Devan] Oh sweet, carrots!

32
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:38,861
Oh he's got it, he's got a hold, he's tryna grab it.

33
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:40,188
There's no saving that chicken now,

34
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:41,914
he's gone, two clouds have ambushed him.

35
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:43,351
Oh, looks like Puffy's a little chemist,

36
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,541
he chose calcium lactate and sodium alginate.

37
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,432
- Yogurt all right.

38
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:47,553
He's so adorable.

39
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:48,621
Oh, he's ready to go.

40
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:49,454
- [Both] Oh yeah!

41
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:50,862
- [Devan] Oh, mozzarella cheese!

42
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:52,331
- [Collins] Oh, man he got the pretzels.

43
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:53,993
- [Devan] How am I gonna use purple cabbage?

44
00:00:53,993 --> 00:00:54,988
- [Collins] Isobel, perfect!

45
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,167
- [Devan] The puppies have picked our ingredients,

46
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:58,296
and now I'm making Frankenstein's brain!

47
00:00:58,296 --> 00:00:59,316
- Wait, tip it right in!

48
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:00,644
- [Both] Three, two, one.

49
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,477
(splash)

50
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:02,310
- [Both] Whoa!

51
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,178
- What's going, what was that?

52
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:04,557
- Yes, now I've just gotta get it out.

53
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:05,390
- [Collins] What is this?

54
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,820
- This is calcium lactate and sodium alginate.

55
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,653
Do you have a ladder?

56
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:09,486
Can you pick me up? - A ladder?

57
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,585
Yes okay sure, here we go.

58
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:11,418
- Just, just pick me up.

59
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:12,841
- There you go okay, I'm sorry you're so heavy.

60
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:13,674
- Put me down, put me down

61
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:14,507
- Okay I'm sorry.

62
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,237
(laughter)

63
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:17,647
- First of all, let's see if we can pull out the bowl!

64
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:19,301
- [Devan] Hold on, hold on, Collins this is mine!

65
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:20,134
- I'm helping.

66
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:21,331
- This is my thing! - I'm trying to help though.

67
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,164
- This is mine.

68
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:22,997
Are you trying to help me?

69
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:24,196
It looks like you're trying to sabotage my art.

70
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:25,418
- Dude it looks like a jelly!

71
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,251
- [Devan] I know!

72
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,084
- Oh!

73
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:28,958
Oh, I can feel it forming! - [Collins] That's like

74
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:29,791
a jelly fish!

75
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,192
It's like a jelly fish! - Yes!

76
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,347
- [Collins] Gonna be freezing this

77
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:33,440
and then smashing it with liquid nitrogen!

78
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,383
(celebration)

79
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:36,704
- [Devan] Our table looks so cool!

80
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:38,205
- [Collins] Oh my gosh! - [Devan] Wow!

81
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:40,460
- [Collins] I have never seen this much sodium alginate,

82
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,953
and calcium and whatever this stuff is in one man!

83
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:44,125
- Yo!

84
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,624
- Wow! - Look at that bro!

85
00:01:45,624 --> 00:01:46,708
- [Devan] Wow! - This is definitely

86
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:47,642
not Spongebob's home anymore.

87
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:48,725
- [Devan] No it is not!

88
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:49,872
- [Collins] Now it's time to smash the pineapple

89
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:52,108
and turn it into Pennywise's brains but here's the thing,

90
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:53,846
this hammer's too small, I'm gonna have to use,

91
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:54,914

94
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,413
- Where did that come from?

95
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:58,366
- This came outta nowhere Devan,

96
00:01:58,366 --> 00:01:59,203
no one saw - what!

97
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,503

98
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,090
And especially not you guys but don't worry

99
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,481

101
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:07,198

102
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:08,375
- Oh my gosh!

103
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,078
(laser) (glass smashing)

104
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:10,911
- [Devan] Wow!

105
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:11,744
- [Collins] It was obliterated!

106
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:13,491
- [Both] The yeet hammer is amazing!

107
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:14,759
Oh my gosh!

108
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,382
(dog barking)

109
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:18,222
- Now it's come the time for me to harvest some honey

110
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,500

111
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,333
Dude!

112
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,281
- [Collins] Holy cow!

113
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:23,731
- [Devan] Look at the ball I made!

114
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:24,564
- Can I feel it,

115
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:25,397
can I touch it? - Yes you can!

116
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:26,230
- I want to caress it's outer shell!

117
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,899
- Behold, Frankenstein's brain!

118
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,114
Massaging the brain.

119
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:30,776
- [Collins] It looks like a giant blueberry

120
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,559
- And it's probably gonna taste even better

121
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,392
than a blueberry.

122
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:34,225
All right, now it's time to find out

123
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:36,038
what's inside Frankenstein's brain!

124
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:36,995

You ready?

129
00:02:41,198 --> 00:02:42,031
Here we go!

130
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,160
- [Both] Three, two, one, done!

131
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,125
Three, two, one.

132
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:47,958
- [Collins] Is it breaking?

133
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:48,863
- [Devan] Not yet, not yet! It's super solid man!

134
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:51,993
- I'm going to a weak point, three, two, one.

135
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:53,205
Oh, this is so bizarre! - Oh!

136
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:54,064
Has it popped yet?

137
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:54,897
- No!

138
00:02:54,897 --> 00:02:55,730
I'm just digging it.

139
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,563
- [Both] Oh!

140
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:57,771
- [Devan] Whoa! - [Collins] It's just juice,

141
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:58,843
oh my gosh!

142
00:02:58,843 --> 00:03:00,902
This is so satisfying! - [Devan] Dude!

143
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:02,378
This is awesome!

144
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:03,411
- [Collins] Wait so where are the brains though?

145
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:05,849
- What do you mean, this is his brains, he's got no brain.

146
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,141
- [Collins] What if that's like the brain juice?

147
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:08,721
- [Devan] Exactly, it just turned to mush in there!

148
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:09,905
- I think I've figured out the perfect way

149
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:10,994
to harvest the honey right here.

150
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:12,166
So check this out, just gonna take my hand,

151
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,055
and gather all the honey.

152
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:15,599
This is gonna perfect for Pennywise's brain juice.

153
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,432
Wait, wait, wait, what is that?

154
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:17,460
- I'm making his hair!

155
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,074
- [Collins] Wait, wait, wait, is that Keyper Kelp?

156
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,459
- Yes, it's my own brand of kelp,

157
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:21,543
dude I'm starting my own business.

158
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:22,376
- But who's buying it?

159
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:23,209
- Well, me.

160
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,042
- You're buying your own kelp?

161
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:24,875
- Yes. - [Collins] All right here

162
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:25,708

163
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,541

00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:29,541
- [Collins] Just gonna push through.

167
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,374
Oh!

168
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:31,207
Look at it man!

169
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:32,040
They're like little meteorites,

170
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,873
(explosions) hitting into the honey,

171
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:33,706
The honey's like a planet.

172
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:34,685
Here we go, I'm just gonna squeeze like this

173
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:35,575
here we go, three, two, one.

174
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,275
Oh, look at that!

175
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,139
Yo, this honey is so satisfying,

176
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,984
and especially when I add it to Pennywise's brain,

177
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:42,101
oh it's gonna be delicious.

178
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:43,712
What is going on? - Dude,

179
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:44,635
where is the end of this?

180
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:45,468
- What is going?

181
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:46,695
- Where's the end? - Hey, hey, hey,

182
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:47,528
You've gotta relax bro,

183
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,361
you've gotta chill! - It just doesn't,

184
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,194
it just ended! - Devan, chill!

185
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:50,777
I've got a yeet hammer! - Whoa, whoa, it ended!

186
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:51,610
- [Collins] Now I'm just gonna squeeze

187
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,612
out some of the honey here, continue to harvest it.

188
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:54,445
Oh!

189
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:55,278
Look at this man!

190
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:56,111
It's called the good thumb, here we go,

191
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:56,944
just like this! - [Devan] Okay.

192
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:57,777
- [Collins] Let's good thumb it down!

193
00:03:57,777 --> 00:03:59,052
Here we go like that, there we go.

194
00:03:59,052 --> 00:03:59,885
Bam! - It works!

195
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:01,226
- [Both] It's now the good thumb!

196
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:02,542
- As opposed to the bad thumb.

197
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,375
(buzzer)

198
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,263
(snipping) All right here we go,

199
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:05,096
time to really squeeze it up, here we go,

200
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:05,929
three, two, one.

201
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,106
Oh!

202
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:09,089
It is so satisfying Devan!

203
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:09,922
Oh!

204
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:10,755
I love it! - I'm totally

205
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:11,588
listening to you!

206
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:12,421
- [Collins] Looks like ad alien creature

207
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,726
from Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker,

208
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:14,688
I'm kind of freaked out a little bit.

209
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,189
Hello and welcome to Yeet News.

210
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,022
- We've got Devan - Yeet, yeet, yeet,

211
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:17,855

212
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:18,688

213
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:19,748
- a professional kelp sculptor - yeet, yeet, yeet,

214
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:20,852
- Devan, what's it like - yeet, yeet, yeet,

215
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:21,685
- to sculpt kelp? - yeet, yeet, yeet,

216
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,480
- yeet, yeet, yeet, yeet, yeet, yeet, yeet!

217
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,588
- Fascinating, back to you Patricia!

218
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:26,421
- Yeet!

219
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:27,254
- All right, next I've gotta transfer

220
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,524
all of this over here into my bowl,

221
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:29,357
all the honey, here we go!

222
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:30,738
(excitement) - This is so much fun dude!

223
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,024
- All right, now it's time to boil the honey,

224
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:34,652
add some agar agar, and create this crazy substance.

225
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:35,765
- [Devan] For his hair color I need to

226
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:36,868
straighten out these kelp noodles.

227
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:38,633
- I've got my melted honey and agar agar,

228
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,708
so here we go, gonna tip it over in three,

229
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,541
- [Both] two, one.

230
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,374
- The high pour!

231
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:43,207
- Oh!

232
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:44,040
- Oh! - Dude!

233
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,873
- It got whisked,

234
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:45,944
prematurely! - That was close!

235
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:46,788
- That was great!

236
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,665
That was an engineering feat of genius Devan,

237
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:50,818
see the way it flipped forward, flipped back,

238
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:51,886
didn't spill one drop!

239
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:53,644
- You know actually, for your track record,

240
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:54,619
that was actually pretty good.

241
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:56,127
- That was pretty fantastic, what do you guys think?

242
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:58,003
- [Devan] Uh, bro, I think they missed it.

243
00:04:58,003 --> 00:04:58,847
- [Collins] Yeah I think you're right.

244
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:00,002
We've got the whisk right here, so again,

245
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:00,835
(power music) I'm gonna,

246
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:01,668
(popping) demonstrate,

247
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,501
my power stance - Collins, Collins!

248
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,334
- and my whisking!

249
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:04,861
- I have some options, for this sifting.

250
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:05,850
Which one should I use?

251
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,773
(heavy guitar music) - Why don't you tell me?

252
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:09,042
- All right, I'm gonna use this thing.

253
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:09,932
- A wiffle ball? - Yes.

254
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:10,765
- Let me see it. - Is this a wiffle ball?

255
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:11,598
- I donno.

256
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:12,663
Pitch it to me dog. - Okay.

257
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:13,496
- Nothing like whisk, - All right,

258
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:14,329
- wiffle ball whiskin' - you ready?

259
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:15,162
- baseball, yes! - Here you go!

260
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:16,388
- [Both] Three, two, one!

261
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:17,221
(popping) - Ow!

262
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:18,279
Time for me to whisk up some honey!

263
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,071
- [Devan] This is not working at all,

264
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,438
wait Collins what're you doing?

265
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:23,028
All right well hopefully this thing works out

266
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:23,861
for Frankenstein's hair!

267
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:25,249
- All right here we go, high knees, high knees and

268
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:26,529
(whisking) - Oh!

269
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:27,367
- Yeah man!

270
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:28,619
- All right here we go, - Yeah!

271
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,790
- That, is how ya whisk!

272
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,354
- [Devan] I think I used the wrong bowl.

273
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:33,074
You know, I don't know what bowl I'm supposed,

274
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:33,907
(glass smashing)

275
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:34,740
(laughing)

276
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,651
- Did you just break that?

277
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:36,484
Seriously!

278
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:38,495
What is even the point of what you're doing?

279
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:39,328
(air whooshing) - All right the glass

280
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:40,161
is all cleaned up and now

281
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:40,994
I've got my fluffed up honey right here,

282
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:42,058
and this is going to be the perfect insulation

283
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:43,652
for the inside of Pennywise's head.

284
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:44,485
Gotto kinda,

285
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:45,318
shake like this - I did not,

286
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:46,151
- give it a little, - see you do that!

287
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:46,984
- have to take a hand, put a hand

288
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:47,817
on one side. - That's amazing!

289
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:48,650
- Here we go - Yup!

290
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,483
- Just with one hand Devan.

291
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,316
- Oh okay, just one. - Just got to give it a little

292
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,149
little back and forth, little jiggle.

293
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:52,419
- Yup, yup, totally in sync.

294
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,263
Dude, you ready for this?

295
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm making the hair for Frankenstein bro!

296
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,927
- Oh, that's actually pretty cool.

297
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:57,760
- All right, well here we go.

298
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,647
It's time to take the color right now and Devan,

299
00:05:58,647 --> 00:05:59,480
without looking, - What?

300
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,313
- What color do you think this is?

301
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:01,146
- Uh, green.

302
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:01,979
- You're wrong.

303
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,067
Uh, this just in, Devan key is not a psychic!

304
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,283
Youtuber Devan key, who claimed to be a psychic

305
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,410
for many years is not a psychic!

306
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,394
- I, never did that!

307
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:11,143
- Yeah, sorry reports say he never actually claimed

308
00:06:11,143 --> 00:06:13,112
to be, okay, sorry - Yeah no I never did that.

309
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:16,432
- If we can cut, back to you Patricia, quickly, quickly cut!

310
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:17,265
(beep)

311
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:18,344
- [Collins] So here we go just gonna add some drips

312
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,494
on here so here it goes gonna go for some drips.

313
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:20,872
- [Devan] This is not how I intended it.

314
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:21,914
- And thank you guys for choosing

315
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:22,896
the best ingredients (dog barking)

316
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:24,399
for me, I really think that I'm gonna be winning this.

317
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,378
I don't wanna say that you intentionally chose

318
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:27,394
wack hair for him, but I mean,

319
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:28,692
you may have intentionally sabotaged.

320
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:29,525
- [Devan] I know!

321
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:30,358
What are you guys doing man?

322
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:31,223
All right here you go.

323
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,728
Oh, oh!

324
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:33,762
- [Collins] To finish of my honey cloud,

325
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:34,985
just gonna scrape off the excess color

326
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:36,425
with a pineapple right now and this is gonna add

327
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:39,072
such a sweet flavor to the inside of Pennywise's brains.

328
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:40,439
- [Man] Twenty minutes later.

329
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,015
- The honey clouds are done,

330
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:44,245
and these things look insane, - Whoa!

331
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:45,078
- and the craziest thing,

332
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:47,848
they feel like an absolute cloud!

333
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:49,668
- This is like cloud slime dude, but solid!

334
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:51,500
And I'm making popping bobas. (popping)

335
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,390
- [Collins] What like Boba Fett?

336
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,223
(laser) - [Devan] Yes,

337
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:54,056
like in The Mandalorian.

338
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:55,085
- [Collins] All right well right now, time to take my jiggly

339
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:56,626
honey clouds and drop them right now into the powder,

340
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:57,735
- Okay. - the powder islands open.

341
00:06:57,735 --> 00:06:58,568
Here we go, three,

342
00:06:58,568 --> 00:06:59,401
- [Both] Two, one.

343
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:00,649
(food hits powder) - [Both] Oh!

344
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:03,819
(food hits powder in slow mo)

345
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:04,652
- Yes!

346
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:05,897
You got it on you, but not on me.

347
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:06,851
- Here we go, bam!

348
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:07,684
(slapping powdered food) - You know what,

349
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:08,517
I'm just going

350
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:09,350
to leave you to this, - All right.

351
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,183
- I'm just gonna grab something, I'll be back.

352
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:11,748
(slapping powdered food) (coughing)

353
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:12,830
- [Collins] We've cleaned up all the powder

354
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,898
and now it's time for the final part of Pennywise's

355
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,572
delicious brain, so I'm going to be smashing

356
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:17,598
a whole bunch of berries.

357
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:18,468
All right here we go!

358
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:19,318
- [Both] Three, two, one.

359
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:20,151
- Let's see this here we go.

360
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:20,984
- Okay, okay,

361
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:22,778
- Boom, boom, boom, boom. - Yup, yup, yup, yup.

362
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:23,705
- Oh my gosh! - Yup!

363
00:07:23,705 --> 00:07:25,765
- The berry seeds, they are everywhere!

364
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:26,799
- All over my face!

365
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,632
- Holy cow!

366
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:28,617
I got hit in the head!

367
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:30,274
You got hit in the head! - I know!

368
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:31,286
- We got impaled with berries!

369
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:32,119
Boom!

370
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,006
Holy cow I lost the hammer, all right here we go,

371
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:34,886
Boom!

372
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:35,719
I lost another hammer!

373
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:36,835
Luckily, we've got a baseball bat,

374
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:38,539
- Oh, luckily we do.

375
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,115
- [Collins] Look at that, oh man!

376
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:41,968
- [Devan] You got it in my bowl for my boba.

377
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:44,255
- It was a very effective method to collect the juice

378
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,457
in a nice little, nice little sample of juice right here.

379
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:47,541
- Collins. - What?

380
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,374
- What?

381
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:50,028
- All in all that went a lot better than it could've.

382
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:51,174
- [Devan] All right, finished up the boba,

383
00:07:51,174 --> 00:07:53,253
this is gonna be perfect for Frankenstein's brain cell!

384
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,619
- [Collins] Luckily I was able to collect

385
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:55,789
all the berry juice, I've heated it up,

386
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:57,254
mixed in a whole bunch of agar agar,

387
00:07:57,254 --> 00:08:00,102
and now it is time to cool it down on some dry ice.

388
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:01,505
- [Devan] All right time to pour in my mozzarella.

389
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,424
- [Collins] I'm gonna dump this dry ice out over like this

390
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:04,257
- [Devan] Oh, wow, okay! - [Collins] So here we go,

391
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:05,090
are you ready? - Yup.

392
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,082
- [Collins] Do not try this at home!

393
00:08:06,082 --> 00:08:07,828
- [Both] Three, two, one.

394
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,494
- [Collins] I'm just gonna go very slowly on top.

395
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:10,661
- [Both] Whoa!

396
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:12,763
- [Collins] Holy cow! - [Devan] Whoa!

397
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:13,631
- [Collins] Look at that! - [Devan] What!

398
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:15,122
- [Collins] Beat that bro, Pennywise's brain

399
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:18,176
is on another level, I'm going to win for sure!

400
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:19,009
Wow!

401
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:20,170
All right well bam, there we go,

402
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,479
berry juice is now cooling down,

403
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,935
cooling down of course in the inside of an igloo.

404
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:26,002
- [Devan] I'm gonna use cheese as the edible glue

405
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:27,026
for Frankenstein's brain,

406
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:28,205
(dog barking) and I can see the puppies

407
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:29,386
are getting very excited about this cheese.

408
00:08:29,386 --> 00:08:30,683
All right, I'm making a nice little dog treat balloon,

409
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,570
with this mozzarella cheese right here.

410
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,200
- And I've collected all the dry ice juice

411
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,856
here in a siphon, that's what this thing's called,

412
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,033
so here we go!

413
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,212
- [Devan] Just gotta shape it like this here.

414
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:40,131
- [Collins] Just give it a quick smack!

415
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:40,964
- You do it.

416
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:41,855
(smack)

417
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:42,688
- I smacked it!

418
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,521
- [Devan] I'm gonna make a balloon

419
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:44,419
out of mozzarella cheese.

420
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,516
- [Collins] All right, well as you do that

421
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:46,349
I'm gonna see if I can take this here.

422
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:47,394
(dramatic orchestral music) Whoa, whoa, whoa!

423
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,227
- I just blew a whole in it.

424
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,340
- See if I can just shoot it out like this.

425
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,173
- [Both] Oh!

426
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:51,100
- [Devan] Dude!

427
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,933
- [Collins] Yo!

428
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,745
- Oh no, my cheese is past it's prime man.

429
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:55,554
- [Collins] It's not an Optimus Prime cheese anymore.

430
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:56,387
- It was never - it has now

431
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,220
- an Optimus Prime. - become a frisbee.

432
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,820
So yeet! (crashing)

433
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,780
- [Devan] Okay, so apparently I've gotta step up my game

434
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,521
because your Pennywise is gonna be lookin' awesome.

435
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:04,692
Oh, its working dude!

436
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:05,706
- [Collins] Holy cow, - [Devan] Look at it!

437
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:06,539
- that little bubble!

438
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:07,372
- [Both] Oh!

439
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:08,205
It popped, Man!

440
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:09,038
- Well as you do that Devan,

441
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:10,404
I've got this drill right here, I've put a head massager on,

442
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:12,046
and this is how I'm hoping to make Pennywise's hair.

443
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:12,879
- Hello, what? - Got an ice-mold

444
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,712
right in here.

445
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:14,545
- [Devan] Three, two, one - [Collins] You know what,

446
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,363
I'm just gonna dip it in like this, all right!

447
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:17,634
And then, here we go, - [Devan] Oh dear, oh dear.

448
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:18,467
- [Collins] just gonna start - [Devan] Oh dear!

449
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:19,300
- [Collins] spinning it slowly.

450
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
- [Both] Oh!

451
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,516
- What! - Yo.

452
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:25,726
- Oh my gosh, I wasn't expecting that at all man!

453
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:27,545
- Oh, yes, here we go,

454
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:28,611
I got it, I got it, I got it. - Is it working?

455
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:29,444
- Yes!

456
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,277
You're very focused on this thing.

457
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:31,208
- [Collins] Whoa!

458
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,505
Here we go let's see this.

459
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,338
- [Both] Oh!

460
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:35,179
- [Devan] Collins! - [Collins] I'm actually

461
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,012
Spider-man!

462
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:37,517
Look it, I've like spider webbed myself bro.

463
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:39,035
- And they're edible too!

464
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:40,513
- Look at that man! - Can I eat it, can I eat it?

465
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,521
- Yeah you can try eating some spider webs right now,

466
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:42,763
see they're biodegradable

467
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:43,717
spider webs here man! - Whoa!

468
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:44,869
- Who knew, all you need is a power drill

469
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:47,166
and a head massager to become a superhero man?

470
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:47,999
This is legit!

471
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,968
This hair is coming out and it's coming out nicely man!

472
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:50,849
- [Devan] That is looking good man!

473
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:51,682
- It's a big chunk of hair

474
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:52,551
right here dude! - Wow!

475
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,925
- Holy cow, could you imagine finding this in your drain?

476
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:57,482
All of us enjoy lovely luscious hair like this.

477
00:09:57,482 --> 00:09:58,659
- It doesn't make me wanna eat it.

478
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:59,704
- That's the whole thing about Pennywise,

479
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:01,674
you don't wanna eat Pennywise cause he's goal's scare you!

480
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:02,726
- [Devan] All right, for my next thing,

481
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,067
I'm making Frankenstein's brain tubes!

482
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:06,067
Now, all I need is to just pour this in.

483
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:06,900
- [Collins] Whoa!

484
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,733
- Yes!

485
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,566
Look at that!

486
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,399
Look at that!

487
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,232
- Look at that! - [Collins] it's not going in.

488
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:11,065
- [Devan] It's not going in.

489
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:11,898
- I think I should squeeze it Devan,

490
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:12,731
cause my hands, (laser)

491
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:13,564
yup, they're made for squeezing!

492
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:14,402
So here we go, woohoo!

493
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:15,693
- Oh, yeah!

494
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:16,526
- [Collins] There we go, just thought

495
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:17,379
I would just give it a quick little squeeze like that.

496
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:18,504
It didn't do anything. - I don't think that worked.

497
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:19,889
All right, filled up some tubes,

498
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,995
now it's time to blow the noodles out from the tube.

499
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,164
Here we go, three, two, one.

500
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,316
(blows)

501
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:25,341
- [Both] Oh!

502
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:26,450
(celebration)

503
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,283
- Three, two, one.

504
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:28,335
(machine blows)

505
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:29,168
No!

506
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,001
- Are you kidding me?

507
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:30,966
- It got all over me - You just,

508
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:32,055
blasted me in the, there we go!

509
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:33,123
And now you're red just like me!

510
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:33,956
(squeals)

511
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:35,075
- Got some balloons here and now it's time

512
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:36,641
to stick them in some liquid nitrogen!

513
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:37,748
(dog barks) - [Collins] Now tell me

514
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:38,581
you aren't a visionary, at first,

515
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:39,632
I had no idea how I could use balloons for Pennywise,

516
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:42,949
but now I think I can actually use it for his forehead.

517
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:43,782
So here we go. - Well before you do that

518
00:10:43,782 --> 00:10:45,244
I have my Frankenstein head right here.

519
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,350
- That's actually exactly Frankenstein's head Devan.

520
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,079
- What, no it's gonna take a ton of work

521
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:49,912
what are you talking about? - No, no,

522
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:51,524
I mean that can looks exactly like Frankenstein's head.

523
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:52,728
We're gonna move the liquid nitrogen

524
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:53,602
very carefully! - [Devan] You're really

525
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:54,435
serious about this.

526
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:55,268
- Oh I'm very serious.

527
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:56,138
And here's the thing Devan, seet!

528
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:58,767
We're gonna be moving Frankenstein's head right here,

529
00:10:58,767 --> 00:10:59,846
and Devan, - It's just a can?

530
00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:00,880
- grab my finger.

531
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,713
- What, okay? - Grab my finger,

532
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:02,546
and pull the lever.

533
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:03,379
- What lever?

534
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,212
- The lever Devan.

535
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:05,045
- What?

536
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:05,968
- Pull the lever! - When did that get there?

537
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:06,801
- Here we go, - Okay.

538
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:07,634
- on the count of three, ready?

539
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,666
- [Both] All right, three, two, one.

540
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,511
(electric shock) whoa!

541
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:11,344
- Here we go Devan, - Okay.

542
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:12,177
- I'm bringing him to life, - Okay.

543
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:13,010
- here we go!

544
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,843
(slap) (pop)

545
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:14,676
- Hey dudes it's me.

546
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:15,853
- [Both] He's alive!

547
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:16,724
- Oh my gosh!

548
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:17,557
Wait so, - No way!

549
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:18,581
- how do you feel right now?

550
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:20,748
- I donno, I'm still pretty new to this.

551
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,133
(knocking)

552
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,071
Yo, Franky!

553
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:23,989
Where'd he go man?

554
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:25,932
You pulled the lever?

555
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:27,603
- Yeah dude, it was getting weird.

556
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,470
pull the lever! - You didn't think

557
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,611
- You just pulled the lever - that was weird?

558
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:30,578
- on your bean Frank!

559
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:32,169
- He doesn't even really have a brain yet.

560
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,981
- Without any further-a-do, it's time to drop a balloon

561
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:34,877
into the liquid nitrogen.

562
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:36,299
Do not try this at home!

563
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:37,346
So here we go, are you ready?

564
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:38,908
- [Both] Three, two, one.

565
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:39,741
Oh!

566
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,925
- It's just bouncing!

567
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:41,804
- It's floating!

568
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:42,949
Here we go, just gonna push it in.

569
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:43,782
Oh my gosh!

570
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:44,631
Look at it, it's deflating!

571
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:46,564
Now freezing the balloon will make it perfect

572
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:47,889
for Pennywise's forehead.

573
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:49,346
Look at it bro! - What, I got avocados!

574
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:50,179
- Look at it here we go, we'll place that

575
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,012
right over here like this! - Oh,

576
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:52,069
- Look at this! - so close to the avocados!

577
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,902
- [Collins] Look at it man!

578
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:53,735
- [Devan] No!

579
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:54,654
- [Collins] Holy cow! - [Devan] It's refilling up!

580
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:55,966
It has a mind of it's own!

581
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,724
- [Collins] This thing is alive right now man!

582
00:11:57,724 --> 00:11:58,557
Oh my gosh!

583
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:00,571
- Flip it over, flip it over, flip it over!

584
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:01,722
(balloon popping) (screaming)

585
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:02,956
- [Collins] That's a lot of avocado's,

586
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:03,789
you're making quick work of it.

587
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:04,636
What're you doing that for?

588
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,256
- [Devan] This is for Frankenstein's head dude!

589
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:07,192
This is Rapid Rise,

590
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:08,469
instant yeast! - That's Rapid Rise?

591
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:09,302
- [Collins] You've gotta have - [Devan] Yes!

592
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:10,135
- [Collins] the instant yeast.

593
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:11,279
Well I gotta say I was hopin the liquid nitrogen

594
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,838
would help me out, but unfortunately it popped the balloons,

595
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:14,106
it ruined the integrity, so now,

596
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:15,377
we're gonna take this bottle of water,

597
00:12:15,377 --> 00:12:16,258
and then gonna fill it up.

598
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,091
So here we go are you ready?

599
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:17,924
Three, two, one.

600
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:19,899
I'm just gonna squeeze like that.

601
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:21,257
So here we go just gonna have to do

602
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:22,090
a couple, couple powerful squeezes,

603
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,961
so here we go, power up!

604
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:23,935
(powering up)

605
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,768
Perfect!

606
00:12:24,768 --> 00:12:26,897
All right there we go, tied off the balloon,

607
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:28,399
and this thing is looking fantastic.

608
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,516
- You can't do this with guac!

609
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,578
- Why is it so hard?

610
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:32,615
- Because this is Frankenstein's head!

611
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:34,215
All right, now I'm gonna add this into the can.

612
00:12:34,215 --> 00:12:35,664
- Look at my balloon man, you fling it like this.

613
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:36,578
(laughter)

614
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:37,411
(excitement)

615
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:38,795
- [Devan] All right, filled this thing up,

616
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:39,628
now I've gotta pop it in the oven!

617
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:40,461
- I'm gonna place this right over here,

618
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,156
and we gotta wait a second for that to finish, don't we?

619
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:42,989
- Yup!

620
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:43,822
- [Man] Twenty minutes later.

621
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:44,933
- All right just popping this thing

622
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:45,766
outta here just like this!

623
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:46,599
- [Collins] Holy cow!

624
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,029
So that's what the avocado bread looks like?

625
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:48,862
- Yes!

626
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:50,070
- [Collins] I've got some boiling how ice-mold here,

627
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,143
we're gonna pour it on the balloon.

628
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:51,976
- Boom, yup! - What!

629
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:52,809
- Oh!

630
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:53,642
- All right here we go!

631
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:54,542
- [Both] Three, two, one.

632
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,034
- [Collins] Just gonna go for a very soft pour

633
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:56,867
over here like this!

634
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:57,700
- [Devan] Oh!

635
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,664
That looks awesome!

636
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:00,561
- [Collins] So this right here is Pennywise's fourhead!

637
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:02,001
All right here we go, just gonna pout a little bit more on.

638
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,142
Oh my gosh!

639
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:04,556
It's so satisfying! - [Devan] Wow!

640
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:07,391
- I'm telling you Devan, you have no idea,

641
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:09,460
how awesome my Pennywise is gonna be!

642
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,232
Boom, okay ice-mold is done!

643
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:13,285
- Now I've just gotta core the center of it out like this!

644
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,118
This is a perfect cavity for his brain.

645
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:16,380
- When I start putting it all together,

646
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,856
my Pennywise is gonna be on another level.

647
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:20,061
Yo these monsters are getting very close to being done,

648
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:22,732
but there's still one more big thing we gotta add to them.

649
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:24,146
- I'm making the dye for Frankenstein's skin,

650
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:25,967
and you might be wondering why it's purple,

651
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,002
and that is because it's about to change.

652
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:29,251
- Please hold this open for a second,

653
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:30,655
all right here we go, just gonna place a pretzel

654
00:13:30,655 --> 00:13:31,488
on the inside.

655
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:33,988
This pretzels gonna act as the front of Pennywise's face.

656
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:34,821
All right Devan, here I'm just gonna

657
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:35,987
suck up some of this good juice like this.

658
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:36,976
- [Both] Three, two, one.

659
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:38,236
(syringe sputters)

660
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:40,893
- Oh it had the squeach.

661
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:41,950
- [Devan] So I got some vinegar right here

662
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,931
and we're gonna pour this in.

663
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:43,865
What are you doing,

664
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,698
and how did you blow that up? - I've gotta

665
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,021
mix up my pretzel up in here hermano.

666
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:46,854
- Okay, you ready?

667
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:47,687
- [Both] Three, two, one.

668
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:48,529
- [Collins] Let's see,

669
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,362
is it going in. - [Devan] Pour it in.

670
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,195
Yup!

671
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:51,028
- [Both] Whoa!

672
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:52,232
- All right, just gonna fill up the rest of it!

673
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,302
Yes! (balloon popping)

674
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:54,469
- [Both] Whoa!

675
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:56,750
- No way!

676
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,917
(slow mo)

677
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,909
- Are you kidding me dude? (laughter)

678
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:01,742
Look at you!

679
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:02,691
Look at this!

680
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:03,830
- It hit the pineapple.

681
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,663
- Look at that!

682
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:05,496
- I'm sorry!

683
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:06,577
- For the first time, I was unscathed.

684
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:08,323
- Yeah, I act like a giant blast shield!

685
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:09,175
- [Collins] Now we gotta coat the pretzel

686
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:10,065
in a whole bunch of yogurt

687
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:11,307
that way it's perfect for the front

688
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:12,225
of Pennywise's face!

689
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,613
- All right now, it's time to turn this thing green!

690
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:15,696
- [Both] Three, two, one.

691
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,713
- [Devan] It's supposed - [Collins] Keep going!

692
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:19,546
- [Devan] to be a dark green, - [Collins] Keep going!

693
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:20,402
- [Devan] look at that! - [Collins] Oh my gosh!

694
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,235
- We've got all the elements,

695
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,099
and now it's time to compile them

696
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:24,133
into the ultimate edible art sculpture!

697
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:25,266
All right, status update,

698
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:26,341
- I'm still single! - It's been about

699
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:28,491
two full days, yeah, Devan is still single

700
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:30,373
and so am I, so yeah!

701
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:31,206
(high fiving)

702
00:14:31,206 --> 00:14:33,857
It's been two full days of working on our art pieces,

703
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,773
and this is all we've come up with!

704
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:37,103
I've had a whole bunch of friends help me out

705
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:38,291
with this thing, which was very nice!

706
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,393
- [Devan] I'm gonna pop my Frankenstein head

707
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:42,152
on there, this is still a work in progress.

708
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:43,091
- [Collins] All right, while you do that

709
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,922
I'm gonna paint the mouth with some edible paint over here.

710
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:45,935
All right, so we've just gotta

711
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:46,768
keep putting these things together man,

712
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:48,770
no other way then forward if you know what I mean.

713
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,603
- Sure.

714
00:14:49,603 --> 00:14:50,614
- You can't go backwards.

715
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:52,162
We've got the finished monsters,

716
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:54,827
and these are the most incredible art pieces

717
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,652
we've ever made on the channel ever

718
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:57,677
and I've gotta level with you guys

719
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:59,855
this wasn't all me, I had to get some friends together,

720
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,678
took about a week, all ten of us put this thing together.

721
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:03,715
- I have to say, I'm not even mad,

722
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:05,164
that thing looks amazing!

723
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:06,801
- [Collins] Before we reveal, It's time to find out

724
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:08,475
who the puppies think created the better art piece.

725
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,347
Dude look and they're so excited,

726
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:11,609
they're so excited to pick the art piece,

727
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:12,515
so here's the thing guys,

728
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,172
Frankenstein, or Pennywise okay?

729
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:16,015
So here we go, Fluffy, I want you to,

730
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:16,848
just focus right here. - [Devan] I think they like

731
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:17,681
their toy.

732
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:18,739
- [Collins] Right over here, so which one do you like?

733
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:22,376
Are you gonna go Pennywise, Frankenstein, Pennywise, oh man.

734
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:23,670
- [Devan] That's a leaf!

735
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,586
And you know leaves are green,

736
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:25,647
and Frankenstein's green. - [Collins] But that's

737
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:27,790
a dinosaur and dinosaurs are like a scary monster

738
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,273
like Pennywise is, that is green,

739
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:30,479
I don't think this is very conclusive,

740
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,101
so I don't think they have a clear opinion,

741
00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:33,368
so you know, let's just do the reveal.

742
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:34,739
We put a tone of work into this,

743
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:36,050
so here is the big reveal!

744
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,743
- [Both] Three, two, oh!

745
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:38,947
- Five second subscribe challenge, we want to see

746
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:40,199
if you can subscribe to this channel

747
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,932
and turn on the channel post notifications

748
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:44,087
in five seconds, you ready?

749
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:44,920
Here we go!

750
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,646
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done!

751
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,125
- If you could do that comment down below Keyper Squad,

752
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:50,958
right now!

753
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,493
- [Both] Three, two, one ta-da!

754
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:54,326
What!

755
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:56,743
(excitement)

756
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:59,633
We got the edible monsters and now its time to find out

757
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:03,106
how they taste, as well as reveal their secret surprises!

758
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:06,922
I gotta say mine, the hair, is just freaking me out!

759
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:07,968
It looks so weird!

760
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,931
- Dude, your whole one is freaking me out!

761
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:11,558
- I'm gonna have nightmares about this thing!

762
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:13,266
- And as mine was drying it got a little cracked

763
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,294
but I actually think it helped the aesthetic you know.

764
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:17,084
- I donno man, he needs some moisturizer bro

765
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:18,264
we gotta lotion this man up.

766
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:19,342
- But that's not the point man

767
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:20,253
he's Frankenstein, he's made

768
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:22,014
from all these different pieces you know.

769
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,327
- All right, it kinda helps it out.

770
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:24,947
So which one do we want to eat first?

771
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:26,533
- [Devan] Oh man, it's such a toss up,

772
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:27,954
they're both so amazing,

773
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,104
I donno, I think lets eat mine first.

774
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:31,274
- All right, so we'll eat your Frankenstein first

775
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:33,013
then we'll come down to Pennywise.

776
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:34,864
- And mine has a very special surprise

777
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:36,202
in the top of his head,

778
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:37,491
yeah that's right it was hollow,

779
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:39,391
so I was able to but his brain in there

780
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:40,814
and some other fun stuff, you ready for this?

781
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:42,124
- Wait, so you're just gonna

782
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:42,957
peel back the top of his head?

783
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:44,682
- Yes, I'm just gonna peel open his head and you'll see.

784
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:45,517
- What?

785
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:46,669
- I was already kinda creeped out by your guy

786
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:48,003
but knowing he has a hollow head

787
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:50,565
I'm like lowkey scared that he's gonna like jump out at me.

788
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:51,398
- Boo! - Hey!

789
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:53,194
You can't do that, you can't do that.

790
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:56,306
Whew, I need to walk that one off, holy cow, okay.

791
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,139
- [Devan] I'm just gonna peel off the top of his head.

792
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:57,972
- Yo be gentle, you gotta be gentle!

793
00:16:57,972 --> 00:16:58,805
His neck is like,

794
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:00,114
(grunting)

795
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:01,764
- I built this monster, I know how it works.

796
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:02,931
- Whoa! (revealing orchestral music)

797
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:03,907
- No looking! (screeching)

798
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:04,757
Don't look in, it's a surprise.

799
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,773
Now I've just gotta take one of these things

800
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:10,461
and drop it in to see the activation, you ready?

801
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:11,294
- When you drop it in, is it just gonna like,

802
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:12,626
shoot out top like a volcano

803
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:14,084
or what's gonna happen? - It very well might do that,

804
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:15,910
he might come to life, he might jump at you,

805
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,937
you know, who knows.

806
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:17,845
- The last part, what?

807
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:19,168
- His eyes might glow you know,

808
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,050
a lot of things could happen!

809
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,101
You ready for this?

810
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:21,934
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, lets,

811
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:22,767
- No you gotta come close

812
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:23,671
- No I think, let's,

813
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:25,263
- You've gotta come more this way.

814
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:26,557
- Okay, oh man all right!

815
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,016
- [Both] Three, two, one.

816
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:28,969
- Drop it in!

817
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,136
- [Both] Whoa!

818
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:32,636
- [Collins] His brains are bubbling bro!

819
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,936
What on earth!

820
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:35,041
- Beat that!

821
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,326
It doesn't smell so great though.

822
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:37,740
- Man, his brains are stinky.

823
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,696
Whew!

824
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:39,539
Sharp!

825
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:40,372
Yep.

826
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:42,789
Very tangy, goes to the back of the throat.

827
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:43,745
- Holy cow.

828
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:45,616
So we're just gonna scoop out some of his brains.

829
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:46,459
- [Devan] Yes we are!

830
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:47,440
- [Both] Oh!

831
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,888
- Man it's just dripping, it's all gloopy!

832
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:50,859
- That's some good stuff!

833
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:51,695
(disgust)

834
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,920
I'm gonna take an ear right here, look at that!

835
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,753
- Oh that's kinda cool, okay.

836
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:56,252
And then I'm gonna take one of these bolts.

837
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,256
- You know what, you've got a bolt,

838
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:58,328
I'm gonna try get some of this eye here,

839
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,236
let's just scoop in here like this.

840
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:02,569
(screaming)

841
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:05,418
All right boom yeah, here we go,

842
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,734
we've got an eye on top of it all!

843
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:08,263
- Should I go for his nose do you think?

844
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:10,494
- Go for it Devan, It's very rare you get to eat a monster.

845
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:11,797
I gotta say, there was a lot

846
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:12,968
of elements that went in to making this,

847
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,614
like first of all, that is the most amount

848
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:15,596
of sodium alginate, poured in the calcium lactate

849
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,171
that I have ever seen.

850
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:18,808
- [Devan] And the brain was the best!

851
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:20,410
- [Collins] I know and when you popped it too!

852
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,612
- I can't wait to see how the popping boba tastes as well,

853
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:24,547
I wonder if it's gonna be different than the other stuff.

854
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:25,746
- [Both] All right here we go,

855
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,249
three, two, oh hold on!

856
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:28,408
- We just launched some brand new merch

857
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,254
so if you click the top link in the description right now,

858
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:31,653
we've got a whole bunch of crazy new designs

859
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,224
so get yours before it all sells out,

860
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:35,333
click that link right now and lets se how this tastes!

861
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,416
- [Both] Three, two, one.

862
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:43,174
(celebration) (yelling)

863
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:48,407
- That is terrible. - That is so bad

864
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:49,245
but I kind of admit it's

865
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:51,062
probably what brains would taste like.

866
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:53,689
For realism, your monster gets an A+,

867
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:56,758
but in terms of taste, Worst thing we've tasted yet!

868
00:18:56,758 --> 00:18:57,621
- [Devan] It's so bad!

869
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:59,457
- [Collins] Now it's time to taste my Pennywise,

870
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:01,285
and I really hope, it tastes better than yours.

871
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:02,490
The first thing we're gonna do is break open

872
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,406
the forehead Devan, it's very domesque.

873
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:07,239
Sorry Pennywise!

874
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,072
(hammer clinking) - Oh!

875
00:19:08,072 --> 00:19:08,905
- That's a hard head!

876
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:09,843
He's resilient okay hold on.

877
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:10,772
- He's wearing a hard hat!

878
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:11,605
- Holy cow!

879
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:12,606
- [Devan] That is harder than I expected.

880
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:13,713
- Actually really this is disturbing.

881
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:14,746
- Is it working, is it working?

882
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:15,881
- [Both] Oh! (explosion)

883
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:16,836
- In my eyes!

884
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:18,409
In my eyes!

885
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:21,271
Oh my gosh, it's the entire ambrosia salad!

886
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:23,522
- [Devan] He's like ten time more disturbing

887
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:24,355
than he was before.

888
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:25,635
Oh my goodness!

889
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:27,687
- Yeah, I did not pop the head off enough!

890
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:28,953
- [Devan] What have you done?

891
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:30,027
- [Collins] I'm sorry!

892
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:31,537
- [Devan] This is terrifying!

893
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,575
- [Collins] Now it's time to see how

894
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:33,654
the inside of Pennywise's head tastes,

895
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:35,760
just remember Devan , it's vegan!

896
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,459
We did A whole bunch of crazy stuff,

897
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,924
I smashed a pineapple with liquid nitrogen,

898
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:40,915
and a yeet hammer!

899
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:42,576
That was a first, we've never done that before,

900
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:44,648
we then made some delicious whipped juice full,

901
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:45,692
that is probably going to be

902
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:46,754
the best tasting part of this whole thing,

903
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:49,209
and of course, we cannot forget the pretzel in the balloon.

904
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:50,042
- Can I take more of him?

905
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:50,993
I wanna take off like the ears.

906
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:52,001
- [Collins] Yeah you might wanna take off

907
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:52,846
a little bit of the hair over here.

908
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:53,854
All right here we go!

909
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:54,687
