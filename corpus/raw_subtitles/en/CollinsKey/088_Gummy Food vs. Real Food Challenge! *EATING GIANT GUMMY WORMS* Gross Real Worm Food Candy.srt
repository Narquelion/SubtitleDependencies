1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,945
- You would never eat a real worm, right,

2
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:03,159
'cause I wouldn't eat a real.

3
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:04,221
Would you? - I wouldn't, no.

4
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:06,279
- Yep, well, we would not under normal circumstances,

5
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:08,462
but today, one of us at the end of this video

6
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:10,320
is going to find out what it tastes like

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,401
to eat a real worm because we asked you guys,

8
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:14,524
what are some real foods and what are some gummy foods

9
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:15,483
you would love to see us eat?

10
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,240
So right now, let's try them out.

11
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,829
Devan and I have no idea what is in store for us

12
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,977
because our dad is the one who went through all

13
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:23,432
of your comments, picked them out,

14
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:25,441
bought the gummy foods and the real foods.

15
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,486
So we're gonna be surprised.

16
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:28,210
So this right here is the first food

17
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,586
that a ton of you guys suggested.

18
00:00:29,586 --> 00:00:31,298
We have no idea what it is. - I hope it's good.

19
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,001
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

20
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,412
- [Devan] Oh my gosh!

21
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:37,073
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

22
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:39,005
- [Both] Dude!

23
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,065
- Oh my gosh. - Three, two, one.

24
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:43,685
(screaming loudly)

25
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:44,744
- [Both] No.

26
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,055
- This is.

27
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:46,888
- Oh.

28
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:49,471
- How does one eat just a fish?

29
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:52,947
See, the thing is I don't even know

30
00:00:52,947 --> 00:00:54,217
how one would go about this.

31
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:55,572
Oo, look, it's squishy.

32
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:56,776
- You're going in in the middle?

33
00:00:56,776 --> 00:00:58,228
- Well, where do you eat a fish?

34
00:00:58,228 --> 00:00:59,277
- You're using a butter knife.

35
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:00,769
Bro, that's not gonna cut anything.

36
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,247
- I don't have anything else.

37
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:03,080
- These are good.

38
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,946
What are these, Swedish Fish?

39
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:04,779
Yeah.

40
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:06,985
- Dude, I can't. - Don't disrespect the fish.

41
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:09,007
- Damn, I might have to.

42
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:09,924
Little fin.

43
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:12,429
- No, no, no, I got a little bit of it.

44
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:13,429
There we go.

45
00:01:15,062 --> 00:01:17,312
It's got scales everywhere.

46
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:25,620
For the fam.

47
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,120
I taste the ocean.

48
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,250
(laughs) Next round.

49
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,527
Here we go, I think it's gonna be delicious.

50
00:01:31,527 --> 00:01:33,446
Three, two, one.

51
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:35,158
- Oh, what is that?

52
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:36,830
- Dude, that's an eyeball.

53
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,969
- What? - That's an eyeball.

54
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:39,391
- What, I can't eat this.

55
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,175
Bro, I can't eat that.

56
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:42,426
- I've got the gummy ones.

57
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:44,140
- Dude, I'm gonna throw up.

58
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,851
- The smell is nau-zhee-a-ting.

59
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:46,768
Nauseating?

60
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:51,191
I am going to enjoy this.

61
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:53,348
I got some gummy eyeballs here.

62
00:01:53,348 --> 00:01:54,809
- Do I really have to eat this?

63
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:58,273
I am definitely not picking this up with my fingers.

64
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:00,362
- It's gummy, but it also kind of tastes like gum.

65
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:02,418
It has a bubble gum flavor to it.

66
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:04,462
- Oh, it's squishy, bro.

67
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:05,800
Oh my gosh.

68
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,163
OK, I literally feel like I'm gonna throw up.

69
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:09,362
Oh, it's looking at me.

70
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,392
It's looking at me.

71
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,279
It's on the fork, it's looking at me.

72
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,691
Oh no, OK, I just gotta get it over with.

73
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:15,634
(laughs wickedly)

74
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:16,945
All right, here we go.

75
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:18,659
Three, two-- - OK, wait, wait, wait.

76
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,751
First, we've got a challenge for you.

77
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:22,455
Right now, we want to see if you can subscribe

78
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:25,145
to this channel, turn on the channel post notifications,

79
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,025
and give this video a thumbs up in seven seconds.

80
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,103
Here we go.

81
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:30,936
Seven,

82
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:31,769
six,

83
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:32,602
five,

84
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:33,435
four,

85
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:34,268
three,

86
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:35,101
two,

87
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:35,934
one, done.

88
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:38,590
If you can comment down below, Keyper Squad right now,

89
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,156
I'm gonna be replying to a ton of you guys

90
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:42,159
who were able to do that in seven seconds.

91
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,591
But right now, Devan, here we go.

92
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:44,812
Time to eat the eyeball.

93
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:46,187
Oh, dude.

94
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:47,020
- OK.

95
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,203
Three,

96
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:49,527
two,

97
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:50,360
one.

98
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,867
It's so salty.

99
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:01,613
- (laughs) Man.

100
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:02,845
Yo, bro, you are a trooper.

101
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:06,621
Right now it's on to round number two.

102
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,800
A ton of you guys suggested whatever this is.

103
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,754
Again, I don't know what it is

104
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:10,901
because our dad picked them out.

105
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:12,491
But let's find out what you guys suggested.

106
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,115
Hopefully, it's delicious just like the last one.

107
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:15,997
Three,

108
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:16,834
two,

109
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,225
one.

110
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,643
- Yeah, I didn't get the real ones.

111
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,062
That's the real egg.

112
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:22,297
Aye, aye.

113
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:23,275
- Eggs are actually kind of delicious.

114
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:24,153
You can scramble them.

115
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:26,414
- No, bro, you gotta eat those raw.

116
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,247
- What? - Bro, you

117
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:28,826
can't scramble them.

118
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:30,568
That's weak, bro. - Raw eggs?

119
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:33,259
- Dude, I had a raw fish eye, come on.

120
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:35,844
- Dude, I've never actually drank raw eggs before.

121
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:38,804
- These are practically raw.

122
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:41,395
It's got a little citrus vibe.

123
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:42,645
It's real good.

124
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:45,207
All right, here is your glass.

125
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:47,563
- I am not excited about this at all.

126
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:51,146
So I think we're gonna crack the first egg.

127
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,639
I guess there's just no easy way around it.

128
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,841
Gotta drink it.

129
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:57,725
- Hold on. - What?

130
00:03:57,725 --> 00:03:58,843
- One more thing.

131
00:03:58,843 --> 00:04:01,272
Before swallowing, you have to

132
00:04:01,272 --> 00:04:03,076
swish them around in your mouth.

133
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,262
- That's not a thing.

134
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:05,996
If I do both, what do I get as a prize?

135
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,006
- You can have the rest of my gummy here.

136
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,256
- [Collins] OK.

137
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:17,825
- Oh my gosh.

138
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,154
- I want the gummy. - You can have them all, bro.

139
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:25,924
- Oh my gosh.

140
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:27,158
- Let's go to the next one before I throw up.

141
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:28,944
For this round, we're making things a little bit

142
00:04:28,944 --> 00:04:31,303
more dangerous because now we're gonna trade

143
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:34,470
off having the ability to swap trades.

144
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,706
So Devan, right now you can choose.

145
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:41,283
Do you want to keep the trays we have or swap them?

146
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,191
- I'll just keep it, I have no idea what I have.

147
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,339
I'm just gonna keep it. - So who knows,

148
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,387
if that was a bad one, you could have

149
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:46,789
swapped it, gave it to me.

150
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:48,047
Next time it's gonna be my turn.

151
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:49,156
Let's go right now.

152
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,369
Let's see what you guys suggested.

153
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,010
Three, two, one.

154
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,478
- [Devan] Aye, it's sushi!

155
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:54,837
- I love sushi!

156
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,124
- Either one of these would've been amazing.

157
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:58,594
- Sushi dance, sushi dance, sushi dance, uh.

158
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:00,371
Give me that, sushi dance, sushi dance,

159
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,345
sushi, sushi, sushi dance.

160
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,240
I like sushi a lot.

161
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,907
Here we go. - Cheers.

162
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,382
Whoa!

163
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:09,861
It's a marshmallow.

164
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:11,485
- Hmm? - Bro, you gotta try that.

165
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:13,005
- Uh uh, I want to try this one.

166
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:14,316
- This is so good. - What is this?

167
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:15,830
- It looks like some licorice stuff.

168
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,995
- Bro, what about this sushi with this sushi?

169
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:20,995
- That's gonna be gross.

170
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:25,546
- That's horrible.

171
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,691
Here we go with the next round.

172
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:30,832
And remember, I can either choose this item or switch.

173
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:31,967
I want to be dangerous.

174
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:33,701
I don't like what's in front of me right now.

175
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,852
I'm gonna swap them out.

176
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,861
So we're gonna do a little shimmy shimmy here.

177
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:37,912
- Shimmy shimmy roo.

178
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:40,009
- Three, two, one.

179
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:40,842
No! - Yeah!

180
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:42,715
- Bro!

181
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:44,459
Dude, these are, like, crazy hot peppers.

182
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,596
- I am so bad with spicy stuff.

183
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,192
I'm so glad I got this.

184
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:50,859
(ominous music)

185
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:53,788
- These are hot.

186
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:56,353
These little ones, I think, are the most intense because

187
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:58,997
they look little, and the little ones, you know, they bite.

188
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:00,385
What? - These are slightly spicy.

189
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:02,466
I don't do well with spicy stuff.

190
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:05,549
It crossed my mind as I was biting it

191
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,008
that this might be spicy.

192
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:09,008
It is spicy.

193
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:12,355
- Why did I chew it so much?

194
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,351
Dude, this is actually really, really, really hot.

195
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:15,886
- Why would you make a gummy version

196
00:06:15,886 --> 00:06:17,886
of this that's so spicy?

197
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:22,026
- OK, this was no joke.

198
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:24,776
This round was intense.

199
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:25,693
Next round.

200
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,997
What kind of pepper is that?

201
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:29,753
Next up, my mouth, ow.

202
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:32,074
It's still in some serious pain from that last pepper, man.

203
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:35,109
There's just this afterburn on my lips, on my tongue.

204
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:36,009
Ow.

205
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:37,669
Next one, let's see what you guys suggested.

206
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:39,160
- Wait, did we get to switch them or not?

207
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,582
- No.

208
00:06:40,582 --> 00:06:41,958
I forgot.

209
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,558
Well, I guess pizza's good both ways, right?

210
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:44,648
So one of these is gummy.

211
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:45,773
- We don't know which one though.

212
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:46,728
- One of them is real.

213
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:49,095
Here we go, three, two, one.

214
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:51,763
- Aye, I got the real one.

215
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:53,090
I have to try a piece of that.

216
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,075
- I'm having a reaction, bro.

217
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:56,456
Look at this. - That looks so crazy.

218
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:58,066
That, I have to try a piece of that.

219
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:02,360
- Oh my gosh, it's a full pizza made out of gummy.

220
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,036
And now it's time for my gummy one, man.

221
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:06,308
Yeah, help me get it off.

222
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:07,983
This looks so wild. - What the heck?

223
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:09,383
I feel like we're gonna break the pizza.

224
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:10,991
- Don't break the pizza, Devan.

225
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:12,113
- We got it. - Dude, what if I

226
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:15,363
could fit this whole thing in my mouth?

227
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:27,556
It's just so tough.

228
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:36,103
Now it is my turn to choose whether

229
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:37,637
or not we switch or keep them.

230
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:40,635
I have had a horrible experience thus far

231
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:42,743
with switching, so we're gonna keep 'em.

232
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:44,873
Here we go, three, two, one.

233
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:47,338
- Aye, yo, this is just a regular Coke.

234
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:49,204
- I got the gummy one, dude. - Bro.

235
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:50,037
- Here we go. - Cheers.

236
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,787
- Cheers, bottoms up.

237
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:57,383
- How does it taste? - Actually,

238
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:59,800
it tastes just like it, dude.

239
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:03,743
It was super hard to break it off.

240
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:04,776
- It's stuck to my teeth.

241
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,315
I wonder, this and this, come on.

242
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:08,148
- Go.

243
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:11,355
Well?

244
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:12,448
Next round, let's go.

245
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,172
This is it, the final round.

246
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:18,730
You guys suggested real worms versus gummy worms.

247
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,951
We don't know which one is which and Devan, it's your turn.

248
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,588
Do you want to switch or leave it?

249
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,511
- You know what, last time I switched it

250
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:29,074
and it actually was the best choice.

251
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,342
I'm just gonna do that again.

252
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:31,527
- Let's hope. - Let's just do that again.

253
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:32,558
- Let's hope it pays off.

254
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:33,740
So we're gonna go for the switch.

255
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,111
- Dude, I'm so nervous.

256
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:36,217
- Why would you guys suggest this?

257
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:37,449
- I have no idea.

258
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:39,616
- Three, two, please, one.

259
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:42,253
Yeah!

260
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:43,086
Woo hoo!

261
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,374
They're alive.

262
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:47,299
- [Devan] Oh my gosh.

263
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,440
- It's moving. - Oh!

264
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,671
- This is perfect payback because I got so much

265
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:53,600
gross stuff throughout this entire video.

266
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,669
Devan, do you want to pick one

267
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:57,976
up really quick and show them?

268
00:08:57,976 --> 00:09:00,726
Oh, it moved! - It moves so fast.

269
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,888
- Oh, it moved.

270
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:06,761
- OK, I don't want to go for that guy.

271
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:08,094
I don't want to.

272
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,467
(distorted screaming)

273
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,178
- Devan is about to eat this worm.

274
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,376
But first, if you want to be featured in our next video,

275

276
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:19,182
you would love to see us eat.

277
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:21,482
And also, the Keyper of the Week is Molly.

278

Here we go, Devan, you ready for this?

283
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:31,302
Three,

284
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:32,372
two.

285
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,240
I'ma eat them.

286
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,490
One, go for it.

287
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:42,324
It's moving.

288
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:43,157
It moved.

289
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:57,799
- Dude, stand up, what are you doing?

290
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,114
Well, there you have it.

291
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:03,367
See you guys later. - I feel like I'm gonna puke.
