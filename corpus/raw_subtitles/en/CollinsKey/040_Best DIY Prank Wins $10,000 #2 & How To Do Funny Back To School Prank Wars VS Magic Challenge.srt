1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
- You challenged us to make three crazy pranks.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,587
The winner gets $10,000,

3
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:04,420
and by the way--

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,384
(both men yelling)

5
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:06,217
- What did you you do to me?

6
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:07,636
(men yelling)

7
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:09,536
- [Collin] You challenged us to make an edible volcano

8
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:11,136
and castle prank so let's go.

9
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,501
- [Devan] To kick it off I'm boiling honey

10
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:13,828
to make a manmade honeycomb.

11
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:16,341
- And I'll be using a pineapple as the base of my volcano.

12
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:18,146
- All right, you said the pineapple, here you go.

13
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:21,021
- Yup, wait that's not a pineapple bro, oh my gosh.

14
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:21,894
All right Devan this is all fun and games,

15
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:23,734
but like how do I get my pineapple out of here bro?

16
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:24,982
Oh man!

17
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:25,815
- Did it work?

18
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:26,648
(groaning)

19
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:27,481
- Wow. - Okay here we go.

20
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:30,914
- Wow, that like actually totally worked.

21
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:32,704
- Wow. - There we go!

22
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:34,916
The pineapple's out, look at that man, that's so cool.

23
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,653
Look at the imprint it left man.

24
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:38,483
Prank's on you Devan, I'm actually enjoying it.

25
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:40,351
How are you gonna make a manmade honeycomb?

26
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:41,360
- With some magic bro.

27
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,024
And my secret sauce is in the baking soda.

28
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:46,399
- [Collin And Devan] Three, two, one, whoa!

29
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,642
[Collin] Dude its like totally bubbling over the edge!

30
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:49,691
- [Devan] It looks like the moon.

31
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:52,134
All right, gotta pour it into the pan first, just like this.

32
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:53,059
- [Collin] Oh my gosh.

33
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:54,721
- [Devan] Wow, it's so fluffy bro.

34
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,554
- [Collin] Oh my gosh.

35
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,185
- It looks kind of funky though, I'm not gonna lie.

36
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,071
Dude my honey settled so well.

37
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,260
- Oh wait what? - Now it's time

38
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,906
to break it up into sand bits.

39
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:03,236
You ready for it? - Do not try this at home!

40
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:05,653
- [Both] Three, two, one, oh!

41
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:09,722
- [Colin] That is perfect sand, dude oh my.

42
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:10,973
- This is gonna taste so good.

43
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:12,035
Nope, nope, nope.

44
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:13,253
- Are you sure, I just want I.

45
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:14,086
- No no no, whoa, whoa, whoa.

46
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:15,191
- Gonna mix up a whole bunch of peanut butter and jelly

47
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:16,070
to make the base of my volcano.

48
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,882
It's not coming out though, hold on let's see if we can,

49
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:18,823
oh boy!

50
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:20,163
- Oh dude, what did you do?

51
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:20,996
- Have you? - Is this?

52
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:21,829
Is that bad? - I think

53
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:22,844
this peanut butter might be expired.

54
00:01:22,844 --> 00:01:24,090
So here we go, we've got the jelly.

55
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,965
It's very bubbly on the top.

56
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:28,307
Wait a minute bro, this isn't jelly!

57
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:30,184
This is slime, wait was this a prank?

58
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:31,017
- Yes it is!

59
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:32,842
All right, I've got a ball of Isomalt here to

60
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,675
- A ba, what?

61
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,713
- Of Isomalt, I'm using it to make sea glass.

62
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:36,546
- Is that related to a seagull?

63
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:37,407
I don't know, like a sea glass

64
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:38,371
is just like glass.

65
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:39,673
- [Devan] Now I poke a little hole in it.

66
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:40,848
Just like this. - Okay.

67
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:41,681
- [Devan] And fill it up with air.

68
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:42,761
- Oh. - It's totally working.

69
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:44,334
- It's like a radish. - A radish?

70
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:45,802
- [Colin] This is one of the coolest things we've done.

71
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:47,040
Of course we can't use this right here

72
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,866
because it's actual slime, it is not edible at all.

73
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:49,911
So we gotta get some actual peanut butter

74
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:50,806
and jelly right now.

75
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,386
All right here we go, it's gonna take the peanut butter

76
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:53,219
and let it drop.

77
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,573
- [Devan] That looks more like peanut butter, man.

78
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,773
- Yeah, oh yeah, just a lot of girth to it.

79
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:57,812
There we go.

80
00:01:57,812 --> 00:01:58,645
- What did you just say? - Oh!

81
00:01:58,645 --> 00:02:00,158
- Got my sea glass bubbles done

82
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:02,743
and not it's time to smash'em up into the glass jewels.

83
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:03,576
(chuckling)

84
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:05,200
And remember, do not try this at home.

85
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,283
- [Both] Three, two, one!

86
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:09,842
Oh!

87
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:11,067
- [Devan] That was insane.

88
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:14,130
- That was beautiful man, that was absolutely beautiful.

89
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,441
- [Both] Three, two, one!

90
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:17,760
Oh!

91
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,325
- Look at that! - That's so cool!

92
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:21,382
- It looks so much like.

93
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:22,964
(upbeat music)

94
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:23,851
- I was gonna hit it again.

95
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,907
Now I'm gonna be smashing my coconnut

96
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:26,634
to make some edible moss out of it.

97
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:27,467
Wait what is that ?

98
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,787
- [Devan] I'm making coral with water, flour, and oil.

99
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:30,911
- You really want to crack open coconut,

100
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:32,609
what you gotta do is look for the little face on the bottom.

101
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:34,296
Then occasionally it'll make funny faces at you.

102
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:35,322
- Balala!

103
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,533
- What you wanna do is find the mouth

104
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,377
and then trace your line right up here

105
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:39,692
and you'll see there's actually a seam.

106
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,227
So right here, look at this, if I take it like this

107
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,469
I was smacking it pretty hard, no crack.

108
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,188
But this time--

109
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:45,021
- Still nothing.

110
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:45,854
Oh wait it actually worked.

111
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:47,324
- Ouw!

112
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:48,157
- I mean--

113
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:49,690
- Oh yes, yes, yes! - Whoa whoa whoa!

114
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,523
You're not getting any of juice.

115
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:51,356
- Dude it's perfect!

116
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:52,875
- No, don't you need the juice?

117
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,120
- [Collin] Look at this!

118
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,795
Oh no no no, I don't actually need the juice.

119
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:57,747
I just need the inside of the coconut.

120
00:02:57,747 --> 00:02:59,477
- Got it. - Just the husk.

121
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:00,310
- Uh oh, it's coming up,

122
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,143
it's coming up. - Okay okay okay.

123
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:02,022
- Duude! - Yooo.

124
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:03,806
- This is so cool! - That looks nuts!

125
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:05,213
- I gotta put my coral down over here,

126
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:07,552
but for some reason there's coconut juice

127
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:08,656
all over it.

128
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:09,489
I don't know why.

129
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,830
- Yeah I don't either, that's very confusing.

130
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,695
- Who would do that?

131
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:13,017
- Let's find him and kick'em off the channel.

132
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:14,416
- No, that's a little drastic.

133
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,225
Next up I'm making some edible kelp.

134
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:17,479
So I've got some calcium lactate

135
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,195
and some sodium algenate over here.

136
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,448
So just gotta suck up some of this good juice here.

137
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:23,110
- [Both] Three, two, one.

138
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,943
- Go for it!

139
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:26,163
(screaming)

140
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:26,996
- [Devan] Dude!

141
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:27,829
It totally worked.

142
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,850
- [Collin] That is so cool.

143
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,062
- [Devan] Instant kelp noodles!

144
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,153
- Oh my gosh, that is insane.

145
00:03:32,153 --> 00:03:33,475
Last thing I need to do to complete my moss,

146
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:34,904
is put all my coconut meat in here,

147
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:36,205
blend it up with some spinach powder

148
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:37,038
and its gonna be perfect.

149
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:38,984
- [Devan] Now I'm cracking up some eggs to make the base

150
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:39,817
for my castle.

151
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,531
- And I'm making some hot lava slime right now.

152
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:42,904
So I've got some cilium husk. - Oh nice.

153
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:43,737
- Add this in like this.

154
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,845
Oh dude, it's already orange which is perfect!

155
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,015
It's just like lava, man.

156
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:48,296
- [Devan] Next up I grabbed this meat.

157
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:49,144
Just add this in here.

158
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,812
- [Collin] Yoo dude, it's coming together.

159
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:52,532
Bro that is gonna be perfect slime.

160
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,296
To cool down the cilium husk lava slime,

161
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:55,518
I'm gonna pour it on the dry ice.

162
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:56,351
Three,

163
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,184
- [Both] Two. - Oh wait wait!

164
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:58,017
- Oh yeah, three second like challenge.

165
00:03:58,017 --> 00:03:59,909
We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds.

166
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:00,742
Ready?

167
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,838
Here we go, - Three, two, one, done!

168
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:06,171
- Three, two, one, oh, whoa!

169
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,473
- Its like bubbling up. - That is so cool!

170
00:04:10,473 --> 00:04:11,306
- Whoa, look at the bubbles! - No way!

171
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:13,156
- [Collin] Look at the bubbles, look at the bubbles.

172
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:13,989
- What! - What!

173
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:15,331
Its expelling so much dry ice right now.

174
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,707
Yo!

175
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:17,616
Look at that!

176
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:19,276
- [Devan] It's going crazy.

177
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:20,650
- [Collin] It looks like something out of a movie man.

178
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,755
- [Devan] All right now we gotta add in

179
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:23,831
some of these sliced up vegetables here.

180
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,329
- Oh my gosh. - Just like this.

181
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:27,682
My last step is to add some of this Agar agar,

182
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:28,884
and then pop it in the oven.

183
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:30,396
- We have the base of my volcano all done.

184
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,117
We've got a pineapple coated with the peanut butter

185
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:33,451
and jelly granola around it.

186
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,284
(thunder and lightening) - Thou shall not pass!

187
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:35,177
- Where?

188
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:36,038
I'm not trying to go anywhere.

189
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:37,686
- You shall not pass this challenge.

190
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:38,743
- What? - That's what I meant to say,

191
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:39,576
you're not gonna win. - No,

192
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:40,409
I'm gonna win the $10,000.

193
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,271
- No you're not. - I will totally win.

194
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:42,104
- You're not.

195
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:42,937
Make the pile on here, yup!

196
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,654
- [Collin] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

197
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:46,637
- Just gotta nail it down just like this!

198
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:47,579
- [Collin] Right up here I got a whole bunch

199
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,298
of peanut butter and carob right here.

200
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:50,737
So this is gonna be the outside of the volcano.

201
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:53,119
- Now it's time to pop out this watermelon tube.

202
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,952
Tower done.

203
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:55,494
All right I'm starting with my towers here.

204
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:56,835
Just putting these down like this.

205
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:58,676
And then grabbing these hot dogs.

206
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:00,384
- [Collin] And just imagine man, as a science project

207
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,095
for back to school this would be perfect.

208
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,481
- All right I'm gonna finish these in a second.

209
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:06,759
But first I have to get out the agar agar solution.

210
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,548
- Oh my gosh, is it your jelly meatloaf?

211
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:09,675
- This is nasty!

212
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,569
(screaming)

213
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:12,657
No, no, it fell apart!

214
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:14,504
- [Collin] Well I'm gonna be mashing some potatoes here.

215
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:16,568
To act as the ocean here around my volcano.

216
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:17,765
That's probably the worst smelling

217
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:19,036
ingredient we've used so far, man

218
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:21,704
- Now it's time to add some sea foam around the sides.

219
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:22,537
- What?

220
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:23,817
That looks light an evil goblin, wait--

221
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,225
- [Devan] When you dip this bottle in here

222
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,707
with this rag on it.

223
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:27,540
- Wait I am so confused.

224
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,373
Wait what's gonna happen? - You'll see, you'll see.

225
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:29,382
Can you grab me some red?

226
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:30,215
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

227
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:31,048
- I just need some red. - Some red?

228
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:31,881
Well I have red over here.

229
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:32,714
- Oh yeah yeah yeah. - Oh wait wait.

230
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:33,547
- Oh yeah that's good.

231
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:34,380
- Pink, pink is fine. - Pink, pink is fine.

232
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,213
All right well here you go, here's pink,

233
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:36,046
want me to open it for you? - Thank you.

234
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:37,427
Now you just blow on this end here.

235
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:38,432
- Wait what's gonna happen though?

236
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:39,265
Oh,

237
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:41,368
that is nuts. - Yup!

238
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:44,151
Just gonna put it on the sides just like this.

239
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:45,792
- I did not see that coming at all man.

240
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:46,625
That was awesome.

241
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,267
- Got a little sea foam moat right here.

242
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:50,595
Oh and by the way these are specialty made edible bubbles.

243
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:51,900
- All right time for us to complete the pranks

244
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,419
and these things are gonna look insane.

245
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,399
We've got our finished pranks

246
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,525
and these are the best ones we have ever made.

247
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:57,486
- These are insane!

248
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:59,498
- On another level, so here's the big reveal.

249
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:02,886
- [Both] Three, two, one, tada, yes !

250
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:03,919
- [Collin] And you get to comment down below

251
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,802
whose prank looks better!

252
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:07,410
Well be tasting them and finding out who wins the $10,000

253
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,389
at the end of the video.

254
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,134
- You challenged us to a candle and soap prank

255
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:11,246
so let's go.

256
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,541
I'm using dry ice as the first ingredient in my prank.

257
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,675
- [Collin] And I've got this little soap bar right here

258
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,529
I'm gonna use it to create corn in a very satisfying way.

259
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:19,989
- Looks like my wax is ready and now its time to dump it.

260
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:20,865
- Wax on dry ice?

261
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:21,710
Is that even allowed?

262
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,776
- What do you mean is it allowed?

263
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:25,193
- [Both] Three, two, one, Oh!

264
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,896
- That is cool man! - That is so awesome!

265
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:29,405
Gotta grab the mint leaf.

266
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:30,916
Gonna create an imprint of the leaf.

267
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,280
This is so cool, I think this totally gonna fool people.

268
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,113
Whooaaaa.

269
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:37,529
- Oh my gosh! - That looks so good!

270
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:38,395
- It is perfect.

271
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:39,764
For my egg I need a push pin, Devan.

272
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:40,925
So do you know where my push pins are at?

273
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:42,109
- Oh yup, its in this box right here.

274
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:42,942
- Thank you, okay here

275
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:44,303
(screams)

276
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,549
oh my gosh!

277
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:47,297
That scared me so much.

278
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:48,480
- Dude I got you so good.

279
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,656
- Best prank so far.

280
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:50,489
- For sure.

281
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:51,497
(screaming)

282
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:53,427
- [Collin] First I'm gonna poke some holes here in my egg.

283
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:55,269
- [Devan] Just gonna juice this lemon into here.

284
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:57,198
- [Collin] Oh my gosh it smells super zesty.

285
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:58,864
- Whoa! - whoa!

286
00:06:58,864 --> 00:06:59,697
Yes !

287
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:01,179
- Once the holes are poked there's basically a magic trick

288
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:02,082
you can do with the egg.

289
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:03,727
You can empty it super fast, just like this.

290
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,966
Here we go, three, two, one

291
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:10,591
- Oh yeah, I love doing that-- - Ah, I broke it no.

292
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,597
My lips, they're just too strong

293
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:14,372
time to inject the egg with some jelly soap.

294
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:16,133
Oh wait a minute its coming out the bottom

295
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,827
I oh, ah, its hot its a little hot

296
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:19,053
- All right got my extra blueberries

297
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:20,223
now its time to squish it.

298
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,299
All right, I'm just gonna squeeze it like this

299
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:23,320
- Wait what are you doing its like a bench bite

300
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,153
- Gotta reopen it, man.

301
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:26,391
- Man, you can't even open it.

302
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,673
- I pranked myself

303
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:28,995
(laughing)

304
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:29,867
But I mean look at this

305
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,814
so I'm using these blueberries just for the coloring,

306
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:33,147
gonna add it into my pan.

307
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:34,024
What are you doing?

308
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:34,857
- [Collin] I'm adding some yellow in here

309
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:36,409
to create the egg yoke.

310
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,988
Trust me its gonna be incredible, man.

311
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:38,876
It's gonna look just like an egg,

312
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,242
except it's made completely out of soap.

313
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,858
- [Devan] Next up I'm hollowing out this lemon.

314
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:42,848
- Oh! - Oh!

315
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:43,832
Is it working?

316
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:44,961
- Perfectly dude, look at that.

317
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:47,356
Now, to do it properly, the outside is perfectly coated

318
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:48,933
and this will at as the yoke in the center.

319
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,007
- [Devan] All right, its time to fill up my lemon

320
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:51,129
with this jelly wax

321
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,944
its gonna be a fake lemon, dude.

322
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:53,777
- [Collin] While you do that I'm gonna try

323
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,944
and remove my silk hard boil egg.

324
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:56,777
You hear that bro?

325
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,233
Here we go the shell's now getting all cracked

326
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:00,221
- Next up I gotta grab this vegetable shortening.

327
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:01,250
- Wow looks pretty big for a shortener.

328
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,512
- Yeah it is. - Ah oh my god

329
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:05,345
- Collins

330
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:06,814
(laughing)

331
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:08,149
- I forgot I did that

332
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:11,496
- Well I'm hoping that this one is not another prank.

333
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:12,593
- [Collins] That was good.

334
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,282
- [Devan] Time to get some scoops of this stuff.

335
00:08:14,282 --> 00:08:15,292
- Dude I fully peeled the egg. - Wow.

336
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:16,552
- [Collins] This is insane,

337
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:18,781
it's literally a soap egg right here.

338
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:21,418
- [Devan] Whoa, it look exactly like the real thing

339
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,474
- This is a perfect prank right here

340
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:24,541
because you would never know

341
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,079
that this is actually a candle, man,

342
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,358
you'd think that looks delicious.

343
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:28,800
- It even kinda feels like it too.

344
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,491
- Is it cold? - No, its not cold at all,

345
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:32,818
but it kinda has the same sorta creamy feel.

346
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:34,198
- [Collins] So this time I'm making a fishcake,

347
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:35,546
just gotta plop it on just like this.

348
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:38,869
- You ready I'm gonna drizzle some cherry sauce on the top.

349
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:40,355
Three, two, one.

350
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:41,188
- [Both] Whoa!

351
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,999
- [Collins] Yo, that looks just like a delicious toping man.

352
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:44,832
All right, here we go,

353
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:45,665
were just gonna put this down.

354
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:46,693
Oh I missed it with the pink, man!

355
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,787
- Oh no! - I'm sorry,

356
00:08:47,787 --> 00:08:48,620
I'm doing my best.

357
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,587
I'm gonna put this flavor on top.

358
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:51,998
Oh amazing, smells like soap in here,

359
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:52,980
wooh, I need to see that, man.

360
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,578
- I mean, that's not the worst smell in the world

361
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:57,302
- Its smells nice and clean, fresh, and a little burnt.

362
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,292
(breathing heavily)

363
00:08:58,292 --> 00:08:59,946
- I got some hot wax here that I'm gonna use

364
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,793
and make sure you do not try this at home.

365
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:04,104
As you can see its already starting to conjeal.

366
00:09:04,104 --> 00:09:05,678
- Hot, hot, hot and I did it!

367
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,772
- [Devan] All right, my topping is done!

368
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:08,516
- [Collins] And I'm gonna slice this thing open right here.

369
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:09,644
Do not try this at home.

370
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:11,934
- Oh that's so cool.

371
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:13,524
- This is the cutes soap ever, man.

372
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:15,355
- [Devan] This looks so good.

373
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,855
- [Both] Three, two, one ahhh!

374
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,246
- My mind is thoroughly blown right now.

375
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:23,600
to make my ramen noodles

376
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,069
I got a whole bunch up hot soap right here.

377
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:29,919
Three, two, one oh my gosh I'm making one long noodle!

378
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,752
- What is that?

379
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:31,585
- Its my noodles, man.

380
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:32,418
- [Devan] Its a good thing

381
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:33,440
those noodles are gonna be covered, man.

382
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,239
- What do you mean covered bro, I think they look awesome.

383
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,082
- They look what? - Awesome!

384
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:38,632
- I'm gonna start making my blueberries here

385
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:41,197
putting them in, whoa, gotta grab it out, yeah.

386
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:42,656
- That's a huge blueberry

387
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:44,448
- I just gotta mold it into a sphere,

388
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:46,894
I got a blueberry here for reference, nope too big.

389
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:48,105
- Well, dude, I'm gonna try to push this down,

390
00:09:48,105 --> 00:09:50,173
there we go, it's coming out, okay, there we go.

391
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,210
- Ew, ew.

392
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,427
Look at that! - That looks so perfect, man.

393
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,623
- [Devan] This looks like a blueberry!

394
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:56,286
- It looks like a perfect blueberry.

395
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:58,933
I wanna feel my noodles now, here we go let's see, whoa!

396
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,164
(both squirming)

397
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:01,164
Its like weirdly slimy,

398
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:02,831
these definitely don't act like noodles

399
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:05,166
but in my ramen I think they'll look perfectly in place.

400
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:05,999
I've got all the ingredients

401
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:07,857
and no its time to assemble our prank.

402
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,690
- [Devan] I'm starting it off

403
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,279
by slicing open my candle lemon.

404
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,270
Oh that looks awesome!

405
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,337
- Oh my God!

406
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:14,830
for my ramen bowl here,

407
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,478
I've actually made the bowl out of soap

408
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:18,619
the second part right here is my soap noodles

409
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,328
and these things turned out so cool.

410
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,875
- [Devan] Wow, those look good, wait, can I touch them?

411
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,266
- [Collins] Yeah you can touch my ramen noodles, dude,

412
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:24,099
they're awesome.

413
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:26,804
- They feel kinda creamy actually, like hard cream.

414
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:28,918
Dude, look at this I got some awesome ice cubes

415
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:30,038
that aren't actually ice cubes.

416
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:32,189
- Wait, what they're squishy. - I know

417
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:33,108
- [Collins] Next I've got some jelly soap

418
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:34,914
and this is gonna act as the broth for my ramen.

419
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:36,478
Yo, I hope this doesn't melt my wax bowl.

420
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:37,311
- [Devan] I got my ice cubes in,

421
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,746
now I'm gonna add some blueberries

422
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:39,579
just like this

423
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:40,744
- It looks so real. - And one lemon.

424
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:41,967
- Oh my gosh.

425
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,417
- Now its time to add the liquid.

426
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:44,250
- What is that?

427
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,743
- Its my jelly wax three, two, one!

428
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:47,779
Oh, this is remarkable.

429
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,107
- Well here we go I'm gonna some corn onto mine right now.

430
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:50,940
This little old some some battering

431
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,114
and corn on the top like that,

432
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:54,049
next I'm gonna add some green unions on the top of mine

433
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:56,007
I totally forgot about the soap eggs.

434
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:57,479
I'm gonna slice this thing open right now.

435
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:58,558
Oh, man.

436
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,777
- Wow. - Wow, dude.

437
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:02,050
- No way. - What?

438
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,883
Oh well, right now its time

439
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:04,319
to add the finishing touches to these, man.

440
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,406
These are gonna look insane.

441
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:07,529
Pranks are done and these look so edible

442
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:08,735
but we are not allowed to eat them.

443
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:09,568
But here's the reveal.

444
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,401
Three, two-- - Oh.

445
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:11,912
- Oh, yeah 5 second subscribe challenge!

446
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:13,501
We wanna see if you can can subscribe to this channel

447
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:16,315
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

448
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:17,148
You ready?

449
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:17,981
Here we go!

450
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:21,564
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done!

451
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:23,261
- If you can do that, comment down below

452
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:24,331
keyper squad right now.

453
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:27,652
- [Both]] Three two one ta da yeah!

454
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:29,020
- [Collins] Oh my gosh, you can comment down below

455
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,347
which one looks more edible.

456
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:31,838
We we'll be testing them at the end of the video.

457
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:34,816
You challenged us to do an extreme pizza prank so let's go

458
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:36,910
and instead of using cheese I'm gonna be using egg whites

459
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,743
to make a meringue.

460
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:38,893
So where are my eggs at?

461
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:40,255
- Actually its kinda perfect you mention it

462
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:41,469
'cause I prepared your eggs for you right here.

463
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:43,199
- No in an block of ice, dude?

464
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,522
This is not even a prank, it's an inconvenience

465
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:47,165
and the only way to get these out is with a hammer,

466
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,076
three, two, one!

467
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,534
- [Both] Oh!

468
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:51,753
- I am soaked!

469
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,726
There's a whole bunch or water, that's the issue,

470
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:54,950
all right, well let's see, let's just--

471
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,117
(banging)

472
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,911
(Yelling) the eggs are broken, I broke the eggs!

473
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:01,747
- [Devan] Now you may have heard of cheese filled crust

474
00:12:01,747 --> 00:12:03,886
but instead I want people to make this ugh face

475
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:04,898
when they bite into my crust.

476
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,633
So I'm filling it with Greek yogurt

477
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:07,466
- [Collins] Oh my gosh!

478
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:09,540
I got the egg out now it time to separate the whites

479
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,171
and the yoke and turn it into some cheese.

480
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:12,544
- I got my meat grinder here and now its time

481
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:14,170
to make some terrible meat balls.

482
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,023
- Nice I'm just whipping up my egg whites over here

483
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:17,564
its gonna look just like cheese when its done, man.

484
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:19,351
- You want any of these cherries by any chance?

485
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:20,812
- Those don't look like cherries, man.

486
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:22,083
- Oh, trust me they're just from a different part

487
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,687
of the world, they're actually really tasty.

488
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:24,520
- Are you sure?

489
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,429
- To prove to you it's not a prank I'll eat one with you.

490
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,437
- [Both] Three, two, one.

491
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:30,072
(yelling)

492
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:31,523
- [Devan] So good.

493
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:33,892
- Ah wow what is that?

494
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:34,725
- So delicious.

495
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,058
- Wait, is it fine for you?

496
00:12:36,058 --> 00:12:36,891
- Yeah, it's great.

497
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:38,049
- Oh my ugh!

498
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,843
- How did you eat it and have no reaction to it?

499
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,247
- I didn't actually eat it, Collins.

500
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:42,445
- [Collins] Next I'm gonna blend it up with this,

501
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:43,278
here we go.

502
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:44,111
Okay, oh yeah.

503
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:44,944
Well, the cheese is done,

504
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,547
this is probably gonna taste really funky.

505
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:47,380
- Yo!

506
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,324
- Oh my gosh someone's gonna bite into this

507
00:12:49,324 --> 00:12:50,204
and think its a meat ball,

508
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,550
but it's literally just gonna make them go ugh,

509
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,434
'cause it's raw.

510
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:54,123
For my meat I've got some prosciutto here

511
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:55,415
and I've actually got a very unique way of cooking it.

512
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:56,830
I'll be using a plasma globe.

513
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,118
But first I need to redirect

514
00:12:58,118 --> 00:12:59,782
all available power to this globe.

515
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:01,916
So, here we go, three, two, one go!

516
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:02,749
- [Both] Yo!

517
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,573
- Oh my gosh, dude, that is crazy.

518
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:05,620
- That's so cool.

519
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,994
I'm gonna see if we can cook the meat,

520
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,326
If it works it might leave an electric after taste

521
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:10,159
to the meat.

522
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:10,992
Three,

523
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:13,429
- [Both] Two, one, oh!

524
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:14,660
- Oh oh, my gosh

525
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,493
I'm gonna use this prickly pear

526
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,034
to see if I can create a spark in between the two.

527
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:17,867
Here we go.

528
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:18,985
- Wait what? - Three, two, one.

529
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:19,818
- [Evan] Is that even possible?

530
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:21,074
What no!

531
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:22,546
- Oh my gosh! - Oh my gosh!

532
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:23,685
- [Collins] Get the lights back on!

533
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:24,750
and see if this actually worked.

534
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,885
- [Both] Three, two, one!

535
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:28,081
Oh!

536
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:29,406
- Dude, did it cook?

537
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:30,770
Dude, smell that.

538
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,715
Right, that definitely smells very electrocuted.

539
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:36,588
- [Evan] And instead of pepperoni I got a sweet surprise

540
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:38,170
for anybody who bites into my pizza.

541
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,588
- Wait strawberry's for pepperoni?

542
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:41,894
- Yes and the secret ingredient is dried ice.

543
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:42,727
- What?

544
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:44,446
Oh my gosh! - Three, two, one.

545
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:45,835
- [Both] Oh!

546
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:47,261
Yo.

547
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,696
- [Collins] It becomes a witch's cauldron again.

548
00:13:48,696 --> 00:13:50,329
- [Both] Three, two, one!

549
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,246
Oh! - Ah

550
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:53,932
Oh my gosh! - I think it's working.

551
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:54,945
- Next up, time to cook the shrimp

552
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:55,984
but instead of using olive oil,

553
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:57,087
I've got some ketchup right here.

554
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,301
Just gonna add it down.

555
00:13:58,301 --> 00:13:59,347
- Is it clogged or something, dude?

556
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:00,536
- Does that look clogged to you?

557
00:14:00,536 --> 00:14:01,883
- Oh yeah, ah.

558
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,183
- Dude, it's just the string.

559
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:05,782
I would never put ketchup on shrimp, that's a big no no.

560
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:07,905
- But you would squirt it in my face.

561
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:08,738
- Exactly.

562
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:10,377
- All right, now its time to see if my strawberry froze.

563
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:11,755
Three, two, one,

564
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:13,706
- [Both] Oh, no!

565
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:15,595
- Now its time to see if it's gonna smash.

566
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:16,432
Safety glasses on!

567
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:17,992
- Do not try this at home.

568
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:19,018
- Oh, it's hard to put on with one hand.

569
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:22,088
- [Both] Three, two, one, oh!

570
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:23,190
- It's still on you.

571
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,901
- [Collins] I got hit with a whole bunch of pieces,

572
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:26,427
strawberry in the throat.

573
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:27,353
Why are you even doing this?

574
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:29,842
- Remember this is my pepperoni substitute, Collins.

575
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,064
- These are perfectly cooked

576
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,908
Ah it's gettin' hot, retreat.

577
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,419
Retreat!

578
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:36,102
- [Devan] Right, now it's time to lather this stuff

579
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:36,969
onto my pan.

580
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:38,209
- [Collins] When this stuff hardens it's gonna look

581
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,079
just like pepperoni, man.

582
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,687
You won't be able to tell the difference at all.

583
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:42,166
- Next step, I gotta dehydrate this stuff

584
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,232
so, I'm gonna pop it in the oven,

585
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:44,076
then I'm gonna take it out

586
00:14:44,076 --> 00:14:45,467
and cut out the pepperoni slices.

587
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,371
All right, it's out of the oven.

588
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:48,190
- Instead of tomato sauce I'm using kimchi

589
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,067
for my pizza sauce. - Wait, no!

590
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,584
- [Collins] So here we go, I'm gonna crack it open.

591
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:51,417
- O wait, wait, wait,

592
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,317
I heard you actually open it upside down.

593
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:54,604
- Okay got ya, here we go, open up like this,

594
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:55,437
you ready?

595
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,435
- [Boh] Three, two, one,

596
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:57,268
- Here we go. - Go quick,

597
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:58,101
You're supposed to go really, really fast.

598
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:59,809
- [Both] Oh!

599
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:00,642
- Yes yes!

600
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:01,883
- What, my hand is covered in kimchi now, Devan.

601
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:03,376
All right, here we go, now time

602
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:04,936
to get it all and to strain it up

603
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:06,555
the sauces is almost done.

604
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:07,388
We got all the ingredients

605
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:08,702
and now it's time to assemble the pizza prank.

606
00:15:08,702 --> 00:15:10,002
So, Devan, what are you gonna start with?

607
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:10,835
- [Devan] Instead of tomato sauce

608
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:12,606
I'm gonna start with Sriracha sauce.

609
00:15:12,606 --> 00:15:15,042
- Oh my God. - No, no, we have to eat this.

610
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:17,195
- Next step, time for my cheesy meringues, so here we go,

611
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:19,963
oh man, egg whites are gonna be all over this thing.

612
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:21,025
Oh, it's coming out the top.

613
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,236
- Why is it coming out at the top?

614
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:23,709
- I don't know, Devan, I broke it.

615
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,863
are you ready for this stuff - What is that?

616
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,623
- [Devan] This looks like jerky than bacon.

617
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,493
- All right, next up, we got these boba balls here

618
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:30,674
they're very slimy,

619
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:33,180
reaching into the bowl is unpleasant.

620
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,144
- Now it's time for my unsuspecting prey

621
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:37,436
to take a whiff and a bite

622
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,269
- Ah-ah.

623
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:39,102
- You're not gonna do it?

624
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:40,590
- No I won't eat an uncompleted pizza

625
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,866
all right, next I'm gonna line the thing with okra, dude.

626
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:43,867
Oh. - Oh

627
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:45,170
- Look how slimy it is.

628
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,348
Right now, time to put the finishing touches on the pizza.

629
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:48,626
- Both pizzas are out of the oven

630
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,260
and these did not turn out how I expected

631
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,282
so, here's the big reveal,

632
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:53,069
- [Both] Three, two, one!

633
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:55,415
Tada, yeah! - What is this dude?

634
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:58,462
- Mine is gonna be so spicy! - Oh my gosh!

635
00:15:58,462 --> 00:15:59,448
you can comment down below

636
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:01,210
whose pizza do you think will taste worse

637
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,466
we'll be eating them at the end of the video

638
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:04,193
and choosing the 10,000 dollar winner.

639
00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:05,829
- [Devan] Got all the pranks and now it's time to test them

640
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:07,948
and find out who's gonna win the $10,000.

641
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:09,731
- [Collins] Remember mine is an active volcano

642
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:11,156
that might go off at any second

643
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:11,989
- Wait what really?

644
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:14,192
- Yeah it might literally erupt, don't even get close, man,

645
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:15,457
you never know what's gonna happen.

646
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:17,419
- My sand castle's pretty legit

647
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:20,396
because it's just as fragile as a real sand castle

648
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,771
So, I think we should eat mine first.

649
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:23,458
I think I'm gonna go for the center bit.

650
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,581
This is a meat in the agar agar

651
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:27,669
you can have some of the tower as well.

652
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:29,332
- No no no no-- - What?

653
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:30,258
- I want the whole tower.

654
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:31,616
- All right, it's like a little treat for you.

655
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,055
- This doesn't, no,

656
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:34,786
I'm gonna say no.

657
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,581
- Three, two, one

658
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:39,312
- Ah the coral is so, oh my gosh, hold on.

659
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:41,941
- [Devan] The orange doesn't really help it.

660
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:43,327
- Ah, it's so cold.

661
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:45,420
- You know what the taste kinds gets better,

662
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,312
'cause remember this isn't a prank

663
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:48,037
on the person eating the sand castle,

664
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:49,245
it's a prank on the person watching

665
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,341
the other person eating the sand castle.

666
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:52,174
- What?

667
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,124
- I've got something to tell you, Devan about my volcano.

668
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:55,238
Its not currently active.

669
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:58,150
But it will be active when we add hot vinegar into it.

670
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,986
I got the vinegar, you can tell it's red,

671
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,514
'cause I wanted to make sure it looks really like lava.

672
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:03,001
We're gonna be very careful, we're gonna pour it in

673
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:03,834
just like this.

674
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:05,168
Next thing is, we got some baking soda here.

675
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:06,518
So, I'm gonna be dumping this in

676
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:08,592
and it's gonna set it all off, it's gonna go crazy.

677
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:09,425
You might wanna step back a little.

678
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:10,543
- Three, two--

679
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:11,376
- Wait wait!

680
00:17:11,376 --> 00:17:13,647
- If you wanna win a 15 minute video call with Devan and I,

681
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:15,966
text the word fun to 81800 right now,

682
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:18,412
so pause the video, text the word fun to 81800

683
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,897
to automatically be entered in to win.

684
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:20,730
Now, let's see what happens.

685
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,554
- [Both] Three, two, one!

686
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:23,387
Oh!

687
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:26,204
(whooshing)

688
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:29,428
- That shot right up at me! - My sand castle's falling!

689
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:30,932
- [Collins] Oh no, now it's time to slice all the pieces

690
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:32,846
of volcano, it's gotten soggy.

691
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:35,262
- I actually wanna eat one of these edible bath bombs

692
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,182
and I'll eat some of that.

693
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:38,316
- Gotta pick up some of the mash potato lotion right here.

694
00:17:38,316 --> 00:17:40,401
Ooh, boy, this smells good!

695
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,484
- [Both] Three, two, one!

696
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:46,069
- Whoa, whoa. - Oh yeah!

697
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,087
You get to comment down below

698
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:48,777
whose you think would taste better.

699
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,398
We'll be finding out the 10,000 dollar winner

700
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:51,231
at the end of the video

701
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:52,095
We got the finish pizzas

702
00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:53,816
and these things are gonna taste funky, man.

703
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:55,838
Mine's got kimchi, yours has got hot sauce,

704
00:17:55,838 --> 00:17:57,319
literal sriracha sauce,

705
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,542
but the first thing we're looking for is,

706
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,314
do they look like a normal pizza?

707
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:01,665
And the answer is no.

708
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,244
They look like fancy pizzas,

709
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:05,935
'cause at a fancy restaurant they put anything on pizza

710
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:07,141
and charge a lot of money for them, they're like,

711
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:08,458
oh, you have cactus on your pizza, sir.

712
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,906
We have shrimp, so right now,

713
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:11,811
which pizza are we going to try first?

714
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:12,685
- I think, let's try mine.

715
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:15,103
I think I made a diabolical masterpiece.

716
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:18,241
Hot sauce in the middle, the wasabi, the cactus, ooh.

717
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:20,460
- And we're judging it based on which pizza tastes worse.

718
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,701
- I don't know where I should cut it from.

719
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:22,534
I think I gotta get some of this.

720
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,367
- [Collins] You can give it an angle.

721
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:24,359
- [Devan] Gotta get the cactus on there.

722
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,902
- [Collins] I don't wanna eat a piece of cactus.

723
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:26,926
- [Devan] Now it's time for my slice.

724
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:28,387
- [Collins] Oh, oh no, the yogurt.

725
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:29,437
I did not think about the effect

726
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:31,974
that cooking yogurt would have and it is not good.

727
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,441
- Got my slice right here,

728
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:35,524
- [Both] Three, two, one!

729
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:37,858
Wooh!

730
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:40,940
(both yelling)

731
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,484
- It's really spicy, but it's so cold at the same time.

732
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:48,259
(Collins grunting) (Devan yelling)

733
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:49,847
- It's so hot, dude.

734
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:52,307
- All the flavors were so contradictory,

735
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:54,121
we had the sweet strawberry pepperoni,

736
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:56,883
mixed with the tart flan, hot wasabi and the hot sauce.

737
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:59,567
- Hopefully mine tastes just as bad,

738
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:00,700
better as in bad.

739
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,474
- No, no, it's gotta be really good,

740
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,307
I hope it's tasty.

741
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:05,165
- [Collins] I gotta say, mine, all things considered,

742
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:05,998
looks pretty good.

743
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:06,831
Let's see, we're gonna lift this off.

744
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:08,372
- [Devan] This crust is ridiculous.

745
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:09,722
- [Collins] Yeah, I know, so here we go, Devan.

746
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:11,430
I'm gonna balance a slice of pizza as I do this.

747
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,494
- I like how you move your whole body

748
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:13,686
when you cut something too.

749
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,291
- Its a sea saw motion that really cuts it.

750
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,491
Learned it from a professional chef.

751
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:17,644
- [Devan] I think this is perfect.

752
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:18,948
- [Collins] Oh, you're a folder when you eat your pizza.

753
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:20,254
- Oh, I have to, man.

754
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:22,566
- Just in Devan folds his pizza when he eats it.

755
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,475
- [Devan] I gotta pull of the front off this, dude.

756
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:25,927
I'm pulling out the front of your pizza.

757
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:26,825
- You're mangling my creation.

758
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,653
Enough talk, it's time for action.

759
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:29,594
- [Both] Three, two,

760
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:30,427
- Oh, wait wait,

761
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:31,399

now let's see how these taste.

769
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,343
- [Both] Three, two, one!

770
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:46,204
- Oh!

771
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:47,037
- Ah!

772
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,184
- Oh, oh!

773
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:49,043
- Ah! - Uh-uh!

774
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:50,046
This is bad.

775
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:51,069
- I don't like that.

776
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:55,219
- That was the weirdest combo of foods I've ever tasted

777
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:57,236
- I gotta say the shrimp was just like a whoopoo,

778
00:19:57,236 --> 00:19:59,388
it came out of nowhere, just at us!

779
00:19:59,388 --> 00:20:00,221
Comment down below,

780
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:01,990
whose pizza do you think would taste worse

781
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,581
and we'll be choosing the 10,000 dollar winner

782
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:04,656
at the end of the video.

783
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:05,720
We've got our soap and candle pranks

784
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,914
and now it's time to test 'em to see

785
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,356
which one is truly worthy of $10,000,

786
00:20:09,356 --> 00:20:10,947
yours looks so amazing, man.

787
00:20:10,947 --> 00:20:11,800
- I know right?

788
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,420
- I could totally see myself picking this up

789
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,366
and taking a drink of this

790
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:16,049
and being very confused why nothings comes out.

791
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,089
Can I try it? - Go for it.

792
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:17,922
All right, let's see, here we go,

793
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:20,674
three, two, one its just a whole bunch of candle wax.

794
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:21,543
What I like about this one,

795
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:23,271
the wick is very hidden on the inside,

796
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:24,104
you can't really see it.

797
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:25,312
- I really like yours too

798
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:27,181
except the Irish Spring, the smell is a dead give away.

799
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:28,014
That is some pungent stuff.

800
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:32,513
- This dirt, to make sure this stuff actually works

801
00:20:32,513 --> 00:20:33,852
and remember, its all made out of soap,

802
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:34,685
got my hands a little dirty right now.

803
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:35,518
- [Devan] Oh, we're going for it right now.

804
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,959
- Oh boy, this is some good dirty dirt.

805
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:38,983
Oh my gosh.

806
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,191
These are hands that have been in the garden

807
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:42,165
making mud balls and not doing any actual work.

808
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:43,639
Gonna try to get the soap out right now.

809
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:45,323
Oh, I can feel its almost ready to come out

810
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:46,969
the soap is out.

811
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,323
- Covered in dirt but it's out

812
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:49,156
- Let's see if it works,

813
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:49,989
rub it all around like this,

814
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:50,855
seems to be working

815
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:51,992
- Whoa whoa whoa

816
00:20:51,992 --> 00:20:53,160
your splashing it everywhere

817
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,236
that actually totally worked!

818
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:55,766
- Yo, look at it sudding up.

819
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:57,255
you can put this in your bathroom sink,

820
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:58,867
could be very confusing, like, nope, that's my soap,

821
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,277
it's not a bowl of ramen, my soap.

822
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:01,110
- I think yours is good,

823
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,386
but I'm not sure if it's gonna stand up

824
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,285
to my dry ice mint leaves, bro.

825
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:05,118
- Excuse me sir.

826
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:05,951
- Why'd you call me sir?

827
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:06,784
- I'm feeling very fancy

828
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:07,784
now that my hands are all washed up.

829
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,599
- Now I think its time to light these candles.

830
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,829
- Oh, yeah, that's the real test

831
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:11,878
to see if this actually works.

832
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:12,965
- And this involves fire

833
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:14,432
so remember do not try this at home.

834
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:15,920
- [Both] Three, two, one!

835
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,427
- [Devan] All right, it's lit.

836
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:18,404
- [Collins] Oh, it's so small.

837
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:19,897
- It's lit, here we go.

838
00:21:19,897 --> 00:21:20,853
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

839
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,190
Oh, I can see it melting a little bit.

840
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,274
- [Collins] It's not gonna do it, it's not gonna go.

841
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:25,512
- Dude, why did I pick such bad wicks?

842
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:27,205
- That one barely worked, this one didn't work.

843
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:29,537
You can comment down whose prank turned out better

844
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:31,418
and we'll be finding out the 10,000 dollar winner

845
00:21:31,418 --> 00:21:32,442
at the end of the video.

846
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:34,701
We've got the $10,000 and time to find out who won,

847
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:36,014
so the first round we're judging

848
00:21:36,014 --> 00:21:37,540
is the candle and soap round.

849
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,945
its cleaned my hands thoroughly.

850
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:39,855
- [Devan] Yes, more candle.

851
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:41,811
My treat worked-- - But--

852
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:43,984
- Yeah, the other one, my drink didn't, so.

853
00:21:43,984 --> 00:21:46,816
- Your drink didn't work so therefore I win that round,

854
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:48,105
so, there we go one point for me.

855
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:49,902
The next one we're judging is the pizza.

856
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:51,097
Both weird.

857
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:53,105
I mean the Sriracha for pizza sauce on yours--

858
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,461
- [Devan] And the strawberry pepperonis were ugh.

859
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:56,808
- The boba really kinda threw it off,

860
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:58,600
all in all both were very funky pizzas,

861
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,266
but yours definitely had that edge to it,

862
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,717
you definitely won that round.

863
00:22:01,717 --> 00:22:02,885
- I took the win on that one.

864
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:04,266
- Devan's got one point, we're now coming

865
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,099
into the final one.

866
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:06,933
The 10,000 dollar winner will be decided

867
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,603
by a sand castle and a volcano

868
00:22:08,603 --> 00:22:11,237
and your sand castle was magnificent

869
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:12,930
there were just so many unique elements,

870
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,282
I've never seen before on yours

871
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:15,889
that really kind of took it to another level.

872
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:20,041
- But yours had actual volcano stuff flying out of it

873
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,973
and your little dinosaur touches with the water

874
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,573
- [Collins] And it literally destroyed yours.

875
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:25,403
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.

876
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:26,610
- I think you won

877
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,711
I think you won.

878
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:29,893
Dude, I think you won.

879
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:31,211
What are you gonna do with the money, dude?

880
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:33,069
- See, I think I'm gonna read all of you guys' comments
