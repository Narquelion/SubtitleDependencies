4
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:08,656

6
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:11,617
so everyone please welcome Devin.

7
00:00:11,617 --> 00:00:13,070
(snaps fingers) - [Brothers] Hey!

8
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,903
- What's up bro?

9
00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:15,530
- Wait, what was that you just said?

10
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,447
- No, it was nothing, so yeah so for this video today guys

11
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:19,020

12
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,864
a whole bunch of crazy girl products.

13
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:23,679
You guys really enjoyed the first video we did of this

14
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,516
so if you guys wanna check that out I'm gonna put the link

15
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:27,803

16
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:29,933
this video is done and if you guys want Dev and I to do

17
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:33,173
a makeover video where we literally make ourselves over into

18
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:35,349
a completely different person let us know by liking

19
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:37,561
this video and if this video gets enough thumbs up then

20
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:41,263
we will go ahead and do that video and comment down below

21
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:44,902
if we do that video who should we make ourselves over into.

22
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:46,947
That makes no sense, doesn't make sense.

23
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,097
- Yeah, no I got it, I got it.

24
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:49,122
- But I think you guys know what I mean so comment

25
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:51,168
down below who should we become if we get made over.

26
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:52,004
There we go, that works.

27
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:54,034
Devin and I are super excited because we are actually

28
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:56,547
partnering with Best Fiends again and this time Devin,

29
00:00:56,547 --> 00:00:58,337
I think you're gonna be even more addicted to this game

30
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:00,942
than the last one because this is their second game

31
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:02,552
in the Best Fiends trilogy and this one

32
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:03,521
is called Best Fiends Forever.

33
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,129
I don't think you've experienced anything like this before,

34
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,583
Devin, so here you go this is the game.

35
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,076
- Yo, this is awesome.

36
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:10,261
- [Collins] Okay, so how would you describe the game

37
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:11,166
right now like what are you doing.

38
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,372
- I'm slapping stuff, I'm collecting stuff,

39
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,223
and leveling stuff up.

40
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:15,056
Yeah, Yeah.

41
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:16,478
- Wait, you're slapping, hold on, no you're like tapping,

42
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:17,679
this is slapping you ready for it?

43
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:18,512
Bam!

44
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,419
Hey!

45
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:20,558
- [Devin] Yo, it actually worked.

46
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:21,391
Crazy.

47
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,332
- If you had like a few words to describe the game,

48
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,560
how would you describe it?

49
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,615
- It's a clicker adventure game, I'd say.

50
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:27,519
- Alright, that sounds fair enough.

51
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,265
The best part is, this app is free so I'm gonna put the

52
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:31,941
download link in description down below so go check that out

53
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:34,166
right now, trust me Devin is already getting into it.

54
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,744
- [Devin] Dude, I am clicking so fast.

55
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,929
- I wanna see if you guys can beat Devin,

56
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,473
the answer is probably yes.

57
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,818
To start things off, Devin and I are getting waxed.

58
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:42,267
- Yes. - So we have two different

59
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:43,575
types of wax strips here.

60
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:45,008
- That was good.

61
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:46,406
- Did you really need to throw it, Devin?

62
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:50,576
- Yeah so we have two different exfoliating body wax strips

63
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:52,544
and body wax strips for normal skin.

64
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:55,110
I dunno what constitutes normal skin but we're gonna go with

65
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,634
the normal one first and the we'll progress

66
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:58,592
our way to the exfoliating one.

67
00:01:58,592 --> 00:01:59,425
We should wax each other.

68
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:00,990
- I think we should just wax you.

69
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,180
- No, I think we should wax each other.

70
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,599
So we are going to wax our arms.

71
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:07,027
Here we go, hold up.

72
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,455
Jeez, this sounds intense.

73
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:11,149
- Wow, that is very adhesive.

74
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:12,205
- Oh my gosh. - That is very sticky.

75
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:13,901
- Dude, put it on your arm.

76
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,847
- I don't want it to get all.

77
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:15,706
- On your hand?

78
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:16,907
That's so weak.

79
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:17,875
- I'm going all the way for this.

80
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,090
Put it on your arm, you gotta rub.

81
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,355
Three, two, one.

82
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:23,031
Oh jeez that actually hurt.

83
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:25,531
Ow, dude look at that.

84
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:27,554
- That's why I didn't do it on my arm.

85
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:29,243
I'll do my leg.

86
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:30,530
- Okay.

87
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,363
(laughs)

88
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:34,526
Okay so we've got strip number one right here.

89
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,150
Bro I feel so bad for you, okay.

90
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,962
He doesn't even know what he's in for man, this terrible.

91
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:38,795
- I really don't.

92
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:39,930
- Okay there we go, that's strip number one

93
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,555
and then I need the exfoliating strip

94
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:44,214
so that way your legs will be fully exfoliated.

95
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:46,530
Pomegranate and grapefruit scented.

96
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,638
Ooh, that smells toxic.

97
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:49,471
- Ah, it does.

98
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,304
- It smells so toxic.

99
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:53,304
Here we go this is strip number two.

100
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:57,119
These are terrible quality.

101
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,116
These are absolutely horrible.

102
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:59,108
So, these ones are terrible quality.

103
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:01,134
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, we were only doing that one to

104
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,831
try it out, you don't need to do a second one.

105
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:03,950
- Well, yeah, yeah we gotta try this one out too.

106
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,331
- Hey, they might have varying results.

107
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:08,166
Alright we're just gonna do one, I'll be nice, you ready?

108
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:08,999
Three, two, one.

109
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:11,666
(Devin yelling)

110
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:13,622
- [Collins] It worked.

111
00:03:13,622 --> 00:03:15,224
Oh my gosh.

112
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:16,057
- [Devin] Ow.

113
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:16,890
- Yo!

114
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:20,757
All of the hair.

115
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:22,189
- That hurt way more than I thought it would.

116
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:24,109
- All the hair is on it.

117
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:25,614
- Ow.

118
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:27,582
That hurt way more than I thought it would hurt.

119
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,886
- Yo okay so thumbs up this video for the fact that

120
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:32,471
Devin just went through so much pain to get his leg waxed.

121
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,489
- That was painful, if even hurts right now.

122
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,301
I'd say it hurts more than the actual waxing.

123
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,134
- Oh my gosh. - It stings.

124
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,749
- If this video gets enough thumbs up then

125
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:41,716
we might do an entire waxing challenge.

126
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:43,093
I don't even know what it would be about,

127
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:45,425
it just involves a lot of wax strips and a lot of waxing.

128
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,484
- What?

129
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:48,045
- So, yeah, thumbs up if you guys wanna see that

130
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:49,461
and let's go onto the next one right now.

131
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:50,294
Boom.

132
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:52,918
- What?

133
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:53,751
- I think I've seen these on Instagram.

134
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:54,677
- Is this like a jellyfish?

135
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:55,510
It looks like a jellyfish.

136
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,343
- No, it's like a.

137
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:57,655
- It really looks, wait what?

138
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,883
I'm so confused.

139
00:03:58,883 --> 00:04:00,225
- Oh, wait, oh, it's a shower cap.

140
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,736
- Oh.

141
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:05,819
Wow, it's got some nice roses on there, you know.

142
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,319
- Devin, 10 out of 10.

143
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,784
- This is the cap we needed to start the video.

144
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,887
- Yes, these are our imaginary caps.

145
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:13,720
But they're real.

146
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,553
- Wait, put it on, bro.

147
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:15,386
- But I don't wanna mess up my hair.

148
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:16,851
- Your hair is already messed up.

149
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:18,243
Oh!

150
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:19,261
- Next one here we go.

151
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:21,786
Alright, so this one is Scalp and Temple Massager.

152
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:24,177
So I've actually been like a little bit stressed lately

153
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:26,034
so I could really, ow.

154
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,538
Yep, it got me.

155
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:30,375
So first impression for this product, it's very dangerous.

156
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,538
I'm literally bleeding.

157
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,216
I'm gonna go for my temple.

158
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:35,009
- Oh, it's a temple massager.

159
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:35,924
- And scalp.

160
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:37,889
- This is my new comb.

161
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,978
- Oh, I get it, this is for the temple, there's like

162
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:41,279
a little like ball.

163
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,112
- Aah.

164
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:42,945
Ow.

165
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,297
It's not very smooth, it really is.

166
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:46,590
- This should be sold for like, free.

167
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,680
This gets a negative five.

168
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,139
- This doesn't get a rating, it shouldn't exist.

169
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:50,972
- Negative five.

170
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:51,839
(laughs)

171
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,312
- This is the next product right here and it is a head wrap.

172
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:55,434
I have been looking for one of these

173
00:04:55,434 --> 00:04:56,508
for a completely different reason.

174
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:58,075
Whenever I work out, if like I haven't done my hair,

175
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,843
my hair is like, just flops in my face

176
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:00,873
and it attacks my eyeballs.

177
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:01,889
- Can you show us a demonstration

178
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:03,665
of how it flops in your face?

179
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:04,530
- But that's like with product in my hair.

180
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,643
- He messed up his hair.

181
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:06,962
- Wait. - It's kind of, wait what?

182
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:08,186
- This is kinda - What?

183
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,458
- Not what I thought it was gonna be.

184
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:13,574
I thought it would be like stretchy but it's not at all.

185
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:15,739
- I'm gonna use It as like a headband, karate kid style.

186
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,027
Perfect.

187
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:17,888
- I thought we were doing karate kid.

188
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:18,843
- I thought we were doing perfect.

189
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:19,676
- Let's try one more time.

190
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:20,802
Three, two, one.

191
00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:21,635
Perfect.

192
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:24,000
I think this will actually make me run faster

193
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,834
because it makes me embody a cheetah.

194
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:27,506
I don't know what to say about you.

195
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:28,828
Everyone's different.

196
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,171
Every zebra is unique. - I'm unique.

197
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:31,825
- Okay, we're done.

198
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,416
Next item are these lint rollers.

199
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,249
- Yeah.

200
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,154
- Yo, okay, people don't know this.

201
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:38,025
Devin and I love lint rollers.

202
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,447
- Well, I like 'em I don't know about

203
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:40,386
(laughs)

204
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:42,065
- I am too lit for these lint rollers.

205
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:43,929
So for those of you guys who don't know the incredible power

206
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,512
of these lint rollers you just.

207
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:49,978
(laughs)

208
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,561
Hey guys, it's lit.

209
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:57,600
Alright, these it says Pro Brow Trim and Shape.

210
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,300
I'm very cautious to go near my brows.

211
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,133
- Yeah.

212
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,477
- Not because they're good.

213
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:02,714
They're not.

214
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,204
Just because I don't want them to be terrible.

215
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:05,731
- Yeah, I don't want them to be worse.

216
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,346
They look like little fish.

217
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:08,179
- I want the blue one.

218
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:09,929
- Like de-boned fish.

219
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:12,507
- I'm gonna test it on my hand

220
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:15,140
instead of on my actual eyebrow

221
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,980
cause I do not wanna lose an eyebrow.

222
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,161
(gasps)

223
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,833
Oh, jeez, I like low key cut my hand.

224
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,429
Yeah, that's a sharp blade.

225
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:22,833
- It's a knife, dude.

226
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,539
- But it's like a brow trimmer, it's pro brow.

227
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:26,897
- How else would it trim a brow?

228
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:27,893
- Be careful.

229
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:29,869
Leave it to the professionals when it comes to the brows,

230
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,626
I wouldn't say go with this.

231
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,885
- Agreed.

232
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:35,883
- And it's6 dangerous, so negative five.

233
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:36,725
In conclusion.

234
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:37,771
Bam.

235
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:40,162
Next up are these mini blenders.

236
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:41,515
Now, we've had experience with the actual

237
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:43,378
Beauty Blender in past videos.

238
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:44,834
- Maybe too much experience.

239
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,042
- Yeah.

240
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:48,142
I gotta admit when I first saw it I thought they were candy.

241
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,274
- It kinda looks like it.

242
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,891
- They look exactly like how candy should look.

243
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,629
They look like little Easter eggs.

244
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,462
- Or little teardrops.

245
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:58,309
Why do you eat those?

246
00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:00,561
- Every time, I'm like maybe they're flavored.

247
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:02,358
How innovative would that be?

248
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:05,417
You're doing your makeup just like Mmm, mint.

249
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,086
They just look like candy and they're not candy

250
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:08,816
which makes me sad so.

251
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,758
- Maybe they're small so you can put it on your dolls?

252
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:12,978
(crickets chirp)

253
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:13,819
Why is it so small?

254
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:15,642
- I think for like more pinpoint areas like

255
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:17,802
the inside of the eye is probably like a big one.

256
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:19,021
Around the rim of the nose.

257
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,280
The ear.

258
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,626
Ear plugs!

259
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:22,758
- That's what they are.

260
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,471
- These are ear plugs yeah.

261
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,304
- They're ear plugs.

262
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:26,137
Gimme another one.

263
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:26,970
- They suck at being earplugs.

264
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,803
That one was in my mouth, just saying.

265
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:28,636
- I need another one.

266
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:29,469
- It was in my mouth.

267
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:30,302
- What?

268
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:31,135
That was in your mouth?

269
00:07:31,135 --> 00:07:31,968
- Yeah. - Ugh.

270
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:34,609
Next up, hair towels. I always thought you could just

271
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:35,927
use regular towels, but I guess not.

272
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,075
- Wait they sell like a specific towel for hair?

273
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:38,908
- Right.

274
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:39,975
We're gonna need the lint roller after this one.

275
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:41,376
- Oh my gosh yeah, for real.

276
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:42,209
This is.

277
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,255
- I don't wanna put this on my hair.

278
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,995
- It looks like a giant slug, look at this.

279
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:47,720
- I don't wanna put this on my hair.

280
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,618
- Since Devin will not take one for the team,

281
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:49,451
I'm about to go for it right now.

282
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:52,521
Alright, so I think you go like this here and then.

283
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:56,741
And then there's a little thing in the back

284
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,104
and you tuck it into it like that.

285
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:00,268
- [Devin] Whoa, super high-tech.

286
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:01,128
- Uh-Huh.

287
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:01,961
Perfectly Toweled.

288
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:03,446
Don't like this.

289
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:04,494
Don't like it at all.

290
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,323
This one's kinda ratchet.

291
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:07,219
It just came right out.

292
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,530
- It says Spa Sister.

293
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,386
Doesn't look like a sister doesn't look like a human at all.

294
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:12,372
- It's just a brush.

295
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,155
I was like waiting for there to be some crazy feature.

296
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:16,385
- Is this the smallest back brush ever?

297
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,218
Is that what it's for?

298
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,418
- Maybe it like specifically focuses on your earlobes.

299
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,003
I'm trying to make something out of nothing here, man.

300
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,493
This is literally just a little brush.

301
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:26,045
- It's just a Spa Sister.

302
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:27,276
- Bye Spa Sister.

303
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:31,083
- Next up, we have this and it is a hand mask.

304
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,500
- A hand mask?

305
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,566
- Yeah, what did I say?

306
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:35,663
- Just clarifying cause that doesn't sound right.

307
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:37,080
Yo, this is wild.

308
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:39,260
- Whoa.

309
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,389
- It's like two little gloves that you put your hands in

310
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,705
and we just gotta go for it.

311
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:44,122
Oh, I don't like this at all.

312
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:47,332
- Yikes. - This does not feel right.

313
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,262
Oh, it feels so funky.

314
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,516
I don't like it.

315
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:52,078
- I don't want to do this cause I don't want it to drip out.

316
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:53,117
- [Collins] I know.

317
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,734
- Maybe this, maybe this is better.

318
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,932
Smells like a toilet.

319
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:58,527
These weren't made for your size hands.

320
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:00,965
- No, they weren't, they were made for little lady hands.

321
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:02,004
So, I don't know what to do now.

322
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:04,633
I looks so weird, it looks like milky almost in the middle.

323
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:05,748
- It's dripping.

324
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:06,619
- [Collins] I didn't know it could do that.

325
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,302
- I dripped it into the second one, we're good.

326
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:09,162
- Ah, you smart.

327
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:10,892
Yeah, I say we get these off ASAP, alright.

328
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:12,075
- Yeah, let's get them off, let's get 'em off.

329
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:12,908
- Let's see what the results are.

330
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:14,462
So we are about to step outside of our comfort zone

331
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:16,266
and do something we have never done before

332
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:19,828
and that is mascara and this stuff scares me.

333
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:20,661
(Devin laughs)

334
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,396
Like, it's getting so close to your eye and Devin

335
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,957
already has, like people have complimented him,

336
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:25,717
he has like luscious lashes.

337
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:28,515
Yo, this stuff literally is pretty scary to me because

338
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:30,692
I feel like you could easily poke yourself in the eye.

339
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:33,444
Whatever mascara's made out of you have that all in your eye

340
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:34,604
(Devin laughs) Is that ink?

341
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:36,468
- Is mascara the stuff that you put on your eyelashes

342
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:38,947
or is it the stuff that you put above your eyelashes?

343
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:40,989
Like on your eyelids. - No, eyelashes.

344
00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:43,300
So I dunno what the size requirements are

345
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,851
but this feels excessive.

346
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,136
- This stuff does not look like it's gonna work.

347
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:47,969
- You ready?

348
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:49,437
- Yeah, I'm ready, I'm waiting.

349
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:50,723
- Okay, look right here.

350
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,556
- Wait, where?

351
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,187
- I dunno just stop doing that.

352
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:54,348
- Wait hold one maybe if I.

353
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:55,874
- Look up, I think they tell people to look up.

354
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:57,430
No, but don't like flutter your eyes.

355
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,660
These are max volume.

356
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,813
These are max volume for sure.

357
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:02,646
- Aah.

358
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:03,688
Bro, you need to not.

359
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:04,826
That is in my eye.

360
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:06,613
- Oh, I'm sorry. - [Devin] Oww.

361
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:09,005
- Sorry, I kinda missed a little bit.

362
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,838
Just open up your eye, do what you were doing.

363
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:11,716
- Ow, it's in my eye.

364
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:12,726
- And then close your eye.

365
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:14,043
(laughs)

366
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:16,115
So I think one is enough, we kinda get the example.

367
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,190
- What? - Yeah, just we.

368
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,195
- No way, dude no.

369
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:20,004
I did it, you have to do it, bro.

370
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:21,264
- Yeah, already know what it looks like, no no no.

371
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:22,420
- No way, bro you gotta do it.

372
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,253
- No way.

373
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:24,086
- Yeah. - No!

374
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:25,137
- Dude.

375
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:26,113
- No, we know what it looks like.

376
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:27,737
- Fine, then I'll do one more on you.

377
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:29,507
Like, one really bad one on you.

378
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:30,472
- That's fair, okay.

379
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:31,985
Alright, let's go for the next one.

380
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:33,333
- Next up is this thing.

381
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,166
- What is this?

382
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:34,999
Oh, I'm holding it upside down.

383
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:35,832
- What is this, Devin?

384
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,276
Dramatically brightening.

385
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:38,109
What are you brightening?

386
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:39,259
Not my nose tip.

387
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:41,496
No, not the tip of my nose, give me highlights.

388
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:42,627
I've heard about these on Instagram.

389
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:43,487
- Where do you give highlights?

390
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:45,627
Is it like right on the center of the brow?

391
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:47,080
I think it has to be spread out, I think

392
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,920
that's what the highlight is, like this.

393
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,791
- Oh okay.

394
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,624
Dude, what.

395
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:51,457
(laughs)

396
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:52,290
- I don't like it, stop it.

397
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,517
I feel like I look weird, I look like an alien.

398
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:54,447
- No, you look beautiful.

399
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,240
- No, don't highlight me ears.

400
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,442
- How about on the bottom of your lip.

401
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:58,874
- Do not dramatically brighten my bottom lip,

402
00:10:58,874 --> 00:10:59,944
no, what about my chin. - The chin.

403
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:01,529
I gotta give it to you. - Wait, where?

404
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:02,556
- I'm gonna highlight your smile.

405
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:03,653
- No! - I'll highlight your eyes.

406
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,000
- You won't. (laughs)

407
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,833
No you won't.

408
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,138
It's dangerously close to my eye, I will fence you away.

409
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:09,464
Let me highlight your smile.

410
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:10,554
- No, you can't.

411
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:12,634
Ha, I have all the power. - No!

412
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,393
So next is the tutorial on how to do

413
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:15,644
a Halloween alien look.

414
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:16,562
(Devin laughs)

415
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:17,736
It just doesn't look real.

416
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:18,770
- It's like a Cirque du Soleil thing.

417
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,296
- It looks almost like clown makeup.

418
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:21,129
Triggered.

419
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:24,173
(dramatic suspenseful music)

420
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:27,082
It says step by step instructions inside to look like this.

421
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:27,915
(Devin laughs)

422
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:30,278
Made with 100% natural minerals.

423
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:31,163
I'll be impressed if they were like.

424
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:32,554
- Made with some rocks.

425
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:33,404
- Yeah.

426
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:34,472
Some rocks.

427
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:35,993
So, I think I'm just gonna throw this at my face

428
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:37,282
and that's how you apply it.

429
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:38,418
- Alright. - Here we go.

430
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:39,395
Ow, frick!

431
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:40,228
It hurt.

432
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:41,061
Let me try that again.

433
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:42,179
This time it'll work, I bet.

434
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,694
Ow.

435
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:45,513
- Whoa, it actually worked, dude.

436
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:46,875
- Yeah, it did?

437
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,708
Cool.

438
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,541
- Yeah.

439
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,374
How did you do it?

440
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:50,516
- I saw this like tutorial on Instagram and I was just like

441
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:52,455
oh, cool I'll try that so then just tossed,

442
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:53,291
like I'll try it on you right now.

443
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,971
You were like tripping out.

444
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:58,035
So next are these like Hello Kitty looking rings.

445
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,627
- Take a blue, right away, taking the initiative.

446
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:02,259
- Alright, I'll go for green.

447
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:04,019
They smell nice, maybe it's like scented rings.

448
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,987
This literally won't even fit on my pinky, bro.

449
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,654
- Whoa, dude. - What?

450
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,148
- There's a little flap. - What?

451
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:11,524
- You open the flap. - Yo what is it though?

452
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,046
Doesn't taste like anything.

453
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,869
Maybe it's for applying makeup quicker

454
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:15,914
like you just have a whole.

455
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:17,131
- I love how those just fit on the.

456
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:18,564
(laughs)

457
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:20,395
- They don't even fit on the first joint of my fingers.

458
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:22,084
- They make it past the first one for me

459
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:23,540
and it's to the second joint but they don't

460
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,986
go anywhere past that.

461
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:26,914
- As you're doing your makeup you're just like oh, I need

462
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,859
this color and maybe it's like an extra hand.

463
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:30,867
- But it's really glossy.

464
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:31,730
(gasps)

465
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,666
It's lip gloss.

466
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,999
Ohh.

467
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:35,832
- Why?

468
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:38,896
How would you even put that on you?

469
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:39,729
It just hurts.

470
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:40,967
I gotta admit you walk into the club you're like yo

471
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:44,219
Ya stuntin', you'll catch eye with these man,

472
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:45,052
just be like what up.

473
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:45,949
You walk into Subway and they're like

474
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:46,927
hey you want a five dollar foot long?

475
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:50,032
You're like nope I got four dollars.

476
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:51,168
These are a massive fail.

477
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:52,883
Kiddie drop.

478
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:53,757
- I caught three of 'em.

479
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:55,671
- Right now, Devin is about to go nude.

480
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:57,373
- What? (laughs)

481
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:59,705
- No, Devin, it's a nude makeup thing, I think.

482
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:01,400
Yeah, actually is nude makeup, you're lucky.

483
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,584
Alright here you go.

484
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,298
I'm also gonna fleek on Devin's brows.

485
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:06,359
And last but not least, we need to make him have

486
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,280
bright eyes cause right now he's got mascara

487
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,464
but he doesn't have bright eyes.

488
00:13:09,464 --> 00:13:10,672
- Nope. - We fleek the brows first.

489
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:12,582
- You sure you know what you're doing, right?

490
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:13,736
- Oh, yeah. - Great.

491
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:14,652
- Shoot.

492
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:15,485
(laughs)

493
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:16,318
- That better not be tweezers.

494
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:17,151
- Let me. - No!

495
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:18,114
- Let me check you real quick.

496
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:18,974
- No, bro.

497
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:20,117
You better not take an important hair out.

498
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:22,228
- Devin has like zero unibrow-ness, I must admit,

499
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:25,776
it's like a scarce wasteland in between his eyebrows.

500
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:29,200
Big fan of the Darth Maul double makeup brush approach.

501
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,884
So there's one end that's like a harpoon spear

502
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:33,222
and then one's like a brush.

503
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:35,959
- That's like the most blunt harpoon spear ever.

504
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:38,221
- I'm trying to make it interesting, Devin.

505
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:40,615
- [Devin] The shark is swimming, just gets hit by a pillow.

506
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:41,683
- He's like Ah, shoot.

507
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:43,197
Alright, look right here I'm about to darken your brows.

508
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,030
- Oh no.

509
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:47,418
- This is terrible, it's just shedding all over you.

510
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:49,379
Ah, look right here?

511
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,462
(laughs)

512
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,990
One brow is like magnificent.

513
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,098
(laughs)

514
00:13:57,098 --> 00:13:57,931
It's huge!

515
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:01,890
- I haven't even seen it and I know it's bad.

516
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,864
- Just a little bit more.

517
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:03,826
- No, do the other one.

518
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:04,659
- No, no, no.

519
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:05,492
Look right here.

520
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:06,325
- Before you do that one, man.

521
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:07,158
Oh no.

522
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:09,603
I can tell with the care that you're using,

523
00:14:09,603 --> 00:14:10,851
you really take pride in this.

524
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:11,741
- I do.

525
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:12,728
I don't normally do things like this,

526
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,252
but when I do, I do 'em fiery.

527
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:15,085
- You messed it up, bro.

528
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:15,918
- Oh, I did.

529
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:16,751
Shoot.

530
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:18,467
That's that the brush side's for, so you can recover.

531
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:20,193
- It's like an eraser.

532
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,817
- Ah, shoot, it's spreading.

533
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,900
(laughs)

534
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:26,838
- Move onto the other one.

535
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:28,277
- No, we're leaving it at one brow, I just need to erase it.

536
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:29,515
- Just that one brow?

537
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:30,619
- This stuff's like permanent.

538
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,452
Alright, there we go.

539
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:33,562
Alright, next I need to make Devin's eyes bright.

540
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:35,162
- Wait, just one eye, dude.

541
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:37,190
- Just one eye bright.

542
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,023
- Why would you leave me unsymmetrical?

543
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:41,224
- I'm gonna go with the glitter one cause you love glitter.

544
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:42,327
- You better not, dude.

545
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:43,651
No glitter! - Okay, fine.

546
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:44,806
- Bro, you can't go glitter.

547
00:14:44,806 --> 00:14:46,890
- Go with red, and kinda spice it up a little bit,

548
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,958
make it a little bit spicy.

549
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,223
- Are you sure this is what you do?

550
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,342
- Positive. - Ow.

551
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:51,981
- It looks like you have pinkeye.

552
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:53,454
- That's what I'm saying.

553
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:54,935
- Do a little under eye pinkeye.

554
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,768
- Why?

555
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:56,728
- Cause then you look like you have pinkeye.

556
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:59,218
Looks like he has pinkeye concentrated in like one eye.

557
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:01,246
Now, it's time to make you nude.

558
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:02,079
What do we do with this?

559
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,391
Alright, so I'm actually gonna nude out

560
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:05,616
one of Devin's eyebrows. - Nude out?

561
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:06,449
(laughs)

562
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:07,710
- Yeah, is that a term? - No.

563
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,815
- I'm trying sound like a makeup guru.

564
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:09,768
- It's not. - Alright look right here.

565
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:10,917
(laughs)

566
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:11,997
It just looks like you have a ton

567
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:12,999
of dandruff in one eyebrow.

568
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:16,037
The most dandruffed eyebrow of all time.

569
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:18,015
Well, it's getting nude alright.

570
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,230
Alright, well, now Devin's nude,

571
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,977

572
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:22,277
(laughs)

573
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:23,502
He's browed on fleeked. - Yeah.

574
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:25,016
- Fleeked on the brows.

575
