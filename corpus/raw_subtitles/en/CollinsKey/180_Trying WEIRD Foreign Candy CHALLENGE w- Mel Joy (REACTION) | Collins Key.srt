1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,267
- Go!

2
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:02,500
- I just ate a cricket.

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,829
Aah, I ate that!

4
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:04,662
(bleep)

5
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:06,013
- What's up! It's Collins Key,

6
00:00:06,013 --> 00:00:07,666
and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

7
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,499
Now, for today's video,

8
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:10,593
if you guys can't tell by the empty chair right here

9
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,902
I need someone to help me out,

10
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:14,564
so everyone please welcome my friend, Mel Joy.

11
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:16,112
(snaps) Hey! Whoa! - Hey!

12
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:16,945
- Now for today's video,

13
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:18,968
we are going to be taste-testing foreign candy.

14
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:20,843
But we wanted to turn this into more of a challenge.

15
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:22,820
So basically, we had a third party go out there

16
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,403
and buy a whole bunch of candy.

17
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:25,946
My dad, he did that.

18
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:27,306
Shout out to my dad, love you.

19
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:28,671
So yeah, he went out and he bought a whole bunch

20
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:30,715
of different candy and we're gonna close our eyes,

21
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:31,792
he's gonna give us the candy,

22
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,982
we're gonna taste, try to figure out what it is.

23
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:35,740
Whoever guesses what it is first,

24
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,353
that person wins that round.

25
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:40,542
And the loser of that round gets one tooth knocked out.

26
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:41,375
Let me explain this.

27
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,797
You guys know when you were kids and your parents would

28
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:44,401
always tell you that if you eat too much candy,

29
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,609
your teeth will fall out?

30
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:46,472
Well that's what's gonna be happening today.

31
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:48,355
So we got this stuff from the costume store.

32
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:49,188
And so it makes it look like

33
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:50,021
you have no teeth in your mouth.

34
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:51,131
For every candy you get wrong,

35
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:52,743
you have to black out one tooth.

36
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:54,481
And so whoever loses the most amount

37
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,788
and gets all their teeth blacked out,

38
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:57,195
that person loses the challenge.

39
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:59,188
We also did a video over on Mel's channel

40
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:00,589
if you guys wanna check it out after this one.

41
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:02,392
We did truth or dare, got pretty crazy.

42
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:03,225
So yeah go check it out.

Also wanna let you guys know I'm doing a giveaway

46

47
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,424

00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,853
and let's try some candy!

55
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:21,140
- [Guest] Hands out, like you're gonna grab something.

56
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,054
Yep, there you go.

57
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:22,887
- Oh boy.

58
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:24,411
- Wait, what? I'm like really scared.

59
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:25,532
- Three, two, one.

60
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:27,013
- Where's my mouth?

61
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:30,585
(Collins shouts)

62
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:32,827
- It's Pop Rocks.

63
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:33,985
Oh my god I love this.

64
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:35,011
(Collins gags)

65
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,844
- I love the noise.

66
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:37,515
(candy popping)

67
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:38,367
- You win the first round.

68
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,251
So I have to black a tooth.

69
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:41,084
I don't like this challenge.

70
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:43,764
Okay. Easy, breezy, beautiful Cover Girl.

71
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:44,953
Oh my gosh, here we go.

72
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:46,703
- Let's try this out.

73
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:50,738
- Tooth number one is gone!

74
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:51,925
'Cause I lost the first round.

75
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:52,758
- [Guest] This is going to be something

76
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:53,591
you squeeze into your mouth,

77
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,304
and you have to squeeze it as much as possible.

78
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:56,137
Set.

79
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,111
- As much as possible? - Oh God.

80
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:57,944
Alright. Good luck.

81
00:01:57,944 --> 00:01:59,273
[Guest Voiceover] One, two, three, go!

82
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:01,592
- It's gonna kill me.

83
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:02,472
- It's not coming out at all!

84
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:04,581
- It's like toothpaste.

85
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,463
Oh, I don't like this.

86
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:08,213
- I can't get it out of this thing at all.

87
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:09,821
- It kinda tastes like skunk.

88
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:10,920
- I can't even get it out!

89
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,112
- I don't like it!

90
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:13,945
- Okay.

91
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:14,979
- Or is it barbecue.. bacon.

92
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:16,717
Bacon! Bacon paste!

93
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:17,550
(clapping and laughing)

94
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,383
Yes!

95
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:21,896
- I couldn't get it out!

96
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:22,729
- (laughs)

97
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:24,250
- I guess another tooth is gone.

98
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,145
(hair dryer blowing)

99
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:29,052
- Alright, you got another tooth gone.

100
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:29,885
This is not fun.

101
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:31,856
Alright next candy, let's do it.

102
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:32,806
[Collins] I have to win this one.

103
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:33,839
For real. - [Guest] Go!

104
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,212
- Okay.

105
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:36,212
- It is a...

106
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:38,432
I know this. I know this.

107
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:39,631
I know this.

108
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:40,464
- I don't like it.

109
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:41,898
- Laffy Taffy. (buzzer)

110
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:43,489
- I don't like it, I don't like it.

111
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:44,322
- It's like ginger.

112
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:45,155
Is it ginger? (buzzer)

113
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:46,240
Is it anything ginger because it's a little bit spicy.

114
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,181
- It's getting spicier as I chew it.

115
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:49,014
- Yeah, it really is.

116
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:50,113
Is it like Hot Toffee or something?

117
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:52,003
(ding) - Oh yeah!

118
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:52,912
- Oh no, I have to do it now?

119
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:54,281
- I'm sorry, but now it's your turn.

120
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:55,598
(hair dryer blowing)

121
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:57,328
- I'm gonna do a front one.

122
00:02:57,328 --> 00:02:58,544
- You look great. - Oh thank you!

123
00:02:58,544 --> 00:02:59,377
- I think it's actually,

124
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:00,210
honestly -- - New look? New look.

125
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,043
- Yeah - Yeah.

126
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:01,876
- I think it's part of

127
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:02,709
the everyday make-up routine from now on.

128
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:03,542
- I think so.

129
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:04,375
- Yeah.

130
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,714
[Guest] Put it in your hand,

131
00:03:05,714 --> 00:03:07,717
and then it has to go directly into your mouth.

132
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:08,550
[Mel] Okay.

133
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,440
[Guest] K? - [Mel] Okay.

134
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,902
[Guest] Hold on one second.

135
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:11,735
- I'm scared.

136
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:12,729
- [Guest] Hold on.

137
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:13,562
- What?

138
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:14,766
- [Guest] Two... - I can't even feel it.

139
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:17,000
It's like soft. [Guest] Three, go!

140
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,986
- What?

141
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:19,102
Is this larvae?

142
00:03:19,102 --> 00:03:20,685
Did you give me larvae?

143
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:21,518
- Is it bugs?

144
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:22,902
Oh my God it's definitely a bug.

145
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:23,735
- It's definitely...

146
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:24,592
- Yeah no, it's totally a bug

147
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:25,506
What is it?

148
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,615
- Oh my God. - I can feel the little legs.

149
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:29,448
I can feel the little legs on it.

150
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:30,281
You swallowed it?

151
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,733
- Yes! (laughing)

152
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:33,566
- Oh my gosh.

153
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:34,838
Is it larvae?

154
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:36,297
- Cricket! I just ate a cricket.

155
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:37,453
Is it a real cricket?

156
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:38,786
Aah, I ate that.

157
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:41,883
No!

158
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:42,716
That's so gross.

159
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:44,174
- I just found a leg in my tooth.

160
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:45,473
- [Guest] Okay, who lost?

161
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:47,049
- I lost. I did lose.

162
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:49,793
(hair dryer blowing)

163
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:52,637
- [Guest] You gotta grip this with your other hand, go.

164
00:03:52,637 --> 00:03:53,825
- Oh I have to dip it?

165
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:55,721
- Oh is it dentist flavored?

166
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,221
Is it dentist office flavored?

167
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:01,357
Oh bad idea.

168
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:03,202
- What'd you do?

169
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,859
Did you just put it all in your mouth?

170
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:05,788
- Yeah.

171
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:06,621
(coughs)

172
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,735
- I inhaled the powder.

173
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:08,568
- I'm gonna try to get a lot in my mouth

174
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:09,681
so I can figure it out.

175
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:11,764
- What if we just pour in the mouth?

176
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:14,263
It's like soda-y. Like bubbly.

177
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:16,051
- Cherry, it's cherry, it's gotta be cherry.

178
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:17,028
Did I get it right? - Oh oh! Cherry coke?

179
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:17,967
- Is it cherry? - Cherry coke?

180
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,154
(buzzer)

181
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:21,777
- Did we get it right? - [Guest] Nope.

182
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:22,610
- What? Okay.

183
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,671
- I don't really know like what they would mix

184
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:24,881
with licorice to taste good.

185
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:25,738
- Sour Patch Kids!

186
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:27,303
(buzzer) - [Guest] Nope.

187
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:28,136
- Sweet tarts! (buzzer)

188
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:28,969
- [Guest] Nope. - Dangit.

189
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:29,899
- [Guest] Sherbet Fountain.

190
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:30,809
- Sherbet Fountain? - Sherbet Fountain?

191
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:32,980
- I've never even heard of Sherbet Fountain.

192
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,813
- Is that the thing?

193
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:35,524
- Just so you guys know, this happened.

194
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:36,357
- [Mel] Yeah.

195
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:37,708
- And now I think since we both lost,

196
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,289
what do you say we both get a tooth?

197
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,646
(hair dryer blowing)

198
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:45,126
- [Guest] Collins gets his first.

199
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:45,959
- [Collins] Noooo!

200
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,792
Noooo!

201
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:48,778
- I'm scared.

202
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:50,193
I'm scared.

203
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:51,572
- [Guest] Three, two-- - I'm scared

204
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:52,405
- Nooo!

205
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:54,738
(crunching)

206
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,627
- Oh! I like it!

207
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:00,131
Actually, I don't know if I like this.

208
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:01,340
- These are actually pretty good.

209
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,173
I like these the most.

210
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:03,699
- I kind of feel like these are shaped like a--

211
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,532
- It's so familiar.

212
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:05,365
- Green tea.

213
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:07,139
(ding)

214
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,711
- Aw it's so cute, look at that.

215
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:11,961
You're too good at this, it's not fair.

216
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:14,959
Alright guys my lips are officially dried out

217
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,309
from the blow drying but now I'm missing the bottom tooth.

218
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:22,605
- [Guest] Guess the flavor of what it is

219
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,141
You can open your eyes, go.

220
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,641
- It's like a little soda can.

221
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,633
- Soda.

222
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:34,265
- Sprite? Is it Sprite?

223
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:35,098
(ding)

224
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:37,392
Yeah! Did I get it right? Yes!

225
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:38,225
No!

226
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:40,312
(hair dryer blowing)

227
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:44,466
- [Guest] You have to guess flavor. Set, open your eyes

228
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:45,299
Go!

229
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:48,688
- It's a speed game! This is --

230
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:49,521
I can't open it.

231
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:50,354
- Are there different flavors?

232
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:51,187
- Toxic Waste?

233
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:52,020
- Yeah.

234
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,603
- If you kill us...

235
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:55,351
- Oh my god, it's so sour.

236
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,832
- Are these like Warheads or something?

237
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:58,932
- I'm scared.

238
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:00,272
- Oh, it's so sour.

239
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:01,857
- Oh, I think I got lemon.

240
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:03,970
Lemon is the most sourest.

241
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,560
Have to give me something.

242
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,393
Oh my God.

243
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:07,562
- [Guest] Eat another one.

244
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:09,029
- I have to eat another one?

245
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:11,011
- Oh, this green one's gonna be... I know it's bad news.

246
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:12,491
(chokes)

247
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:13,707
- This is like the Warhead challenge.

248
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,803
We're totally doing a Warhead challenge right now.

249
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:18,099
- Another green one.

250
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,971
I'm literally crying right now.

251
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:22,138
I don't know, is it lemon?

252
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,463
Why did you do sour apple first?

253
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:26,303
- [Guest] Do another one.

254
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,015
- I just wanna end with black cherry.

255
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:31,263
I think black cherry, I win, right?

256
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:32,431
- I've got four in my mouth now.

257
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:33,264
- Yeah, me too.

258
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:35,063
That's it, I'm done. Abort.

259
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:36,695
- That was painful.

260
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:39,151
- Ow! My tongue really hurts.

261
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:40,008
So that one was kinda cruel,

262
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,456
neither of us are gonna have to put anything black

263
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:42,967
on our mouth cause that was a form of punishment.

264
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:43,800
- I like that.

265
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,241
- [Guest] You have to guess the flavor.

266
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:47,691
- Cheers? No cheers, you're going for it. Cheers?

267
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,613
- There was no tink, though. There's no tink.

268
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:50,557
- There!

269
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:51,893
- There we go, hey!

270
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:54,021
- Oh, it smells terrible.

271
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:55,104
- Uh. Hmm-mm.

272
00:06:56,278 --> 00:06:59,215
It just gets worse the more you keep drinking it.

273
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:00,278
- Mm. It's horrible.

274
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:01,337
- Wait, are your eyes closed?

275
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,170
- Yeah!

276
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,534
- Okay, just... (laughs)

277
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:04,383
- [Guest] Keep drinking!

278
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,422
- Is it boar puckey?

279
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:06,310
Cause that's what it tastes like.

280
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,998
- No, it's just getting worse, it's getting worse.

281
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:08,831
- I don't like it, I don't like it.

282
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:09,664
- It honestly tastes like

283
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:10,497
rotten egg when you first drink it.

284
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,272
And then the aftertaste is like marshmallow.

285
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:13,184
Sweet corn.

286
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,017
- Is it sweet corn?

287
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:14,850
- [Guest] Yes!

288
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,517
- No! It's so gross!

289
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,680
- I would not drink this!

290
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,123
- This is disgusting!

291
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:22,057
- It looks like--

292
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:24,885
You all know what it looks like.

293
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:27,654
(hair dryer)

294
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:31,200
- Alright guys, I am now missing, I think, all my top teeth.

295
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,321
- So you're about to lose.

296
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:34,009
- So yeah, it's kinda like the last round right here.

297
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:35,656
We'll do the finale.

298
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,800
- Yep, the finale. Let's do it.

299
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,792
- Winner takes all.

300
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:38,976
- [Guest] Guessing flavor.

301
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:41,425
Three, two, you can open your eyes if you want to, go!

302
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:42,258
- Okay.

303
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:47,572
It's very chemical.

304
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:48,603
- Licorice?

305
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:49,554
- No.

306
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,706
- Socks. Mm-mm, no, no, no.

307
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:52,539
- It's very chemical.

308
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,372
It's so chemical.

309
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,786
- Like Windex? It tastes like cleaner.

310
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:57,643
- Mm-hmm. It tastes like soap.

311
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,347
- It's detergent.

312
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:00,180
- [Guest] No.

313
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,180
- Aah, this is terrible.

314
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,340
Horrible.

315
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,725
This isn't even candy.

316
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:09,236
- Don't eat this for fun, please.

317
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:10,892
I'm convinced it's Clorox.

318
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:12,836
- I can't... What is it?

319
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:13,742
- Clove!

320
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:14,575
- What's clove?

321
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:15,724
- Clove! (laughs)

322
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:16,954
- What is clove?

323
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,852
- [Guest] It says it'll make your mouth numb though.

324
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:20,269
- Oh, numb, numb.

325
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,054
It's working, I'm gonna be honest.

326
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:24,116
- It low-key is.

327
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:24,949
Before you guys go any further,

328
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:26,116
make sure you guys go watch the video

329
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:27,093
that is on her channel.

330
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:28,950
We even put a link right up over there.

331
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,485
I'm also going to put a link down in the description.

332
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:31,324
So go check out that video.

333
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:32,157
If you're one of my people, go support it,

334
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:34,981
give it a like, leave a comment on her video.

335
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:35,814
- Thank you.

336
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:36,647
- I love you guys so much.

337
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:37,708
I will see you all again next week.

338
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,541
You know what Mel,

339
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,156
you get to snap and make me disappear right now.

340
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:41,668
- Alright, I'm excited. Ready?

341
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:43,436
(snaps)

342
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:44,674
Bye guys! (laughs)
