1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:02,993
- [Collin] We've got real food versus slime food.

2
00:00:02,993 --> 00:00:04,988
(both men shout) Whoa!

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:08,992
- You challenged us to turn real food into slime food.

4
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:10,432
So right now, we're kicking it off

5
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:11,928
obviously with cereal.

6
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,610
- Yup, I think I spilled just a little bit.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,752
(both men shout) Glue!

8
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:16,936
- Ew!

9
00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:17,769
- You just got it everywhere.

10
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:18,602
- Yo, I think I messed up

11
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,006
I added so much Sta-Flow at once.

12
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:21,627
- (disgusted sound)

13
00:00:21,627 --> 00:00:23,169
- (shouts) Ah, I just blasted it all over the table!

14
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:24,908
- (alien music) Mine looks like an alien mucus

15
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,376
(fake sneeze) and then there's this.

16
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:27,209
- Eww.

17
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:28,092
Well, I'm gonna add some into yours.

18
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:29,263
- (shouts) No!

19
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,103
Get your Sta-Flow out my bowl.

20
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:32,832
(shouts) Oh, dude this is crazy!

21
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,205
- I know, it is really weird.

22
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:35,950
- (crazy scream)

23
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,595
(blubbering sound)

24
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:38,595
Whee! (laughs)

25
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:39,909
Just in case it wasn't obvious

26
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:43,072
this right here is going to be the milk.

27
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:44,740
I totally meant to do that.

28
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,900
- My arms are hurting.

29
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,817
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,459
Slime is a Gucci good time.

31
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:50,991
(rope sound)

32
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:51,824
Oh yeah, mines perfect.

33
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:53,327
Dude, it's not even sticking to my hand anymore.

34
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:54,160
- Really?

35
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,960
- I can go, whee!

36
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,279
That didn't happen.

37
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:59,112
- Wait, we're connected.

38
00:00:59,112 --> 00:01:00,287
- (shouts) No, get off me!

39
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:01,120
Stop it!

40
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,829
Why is yours dripping all over me!?

41
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,487
You got it all over the chair!

42
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:06,528
Bro, are you kidding me!?

43
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:07,959
- How did I end up with your slime?

44
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,994
- Are you kidding me!?

45
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:10,574
What is wrong with your slime?

46
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:12,271
Where did my slime go, what the heck?

47
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:13,685
Bro, this is game over.

48
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:14,934
We haven't even made the milk yet.

49
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:15,894
- My arms are so tired

50
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:16,897
I have double slime.

51
00:01:16,897 --> 00:01:19,319
- We're gonna take a quick break right now.

52
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,511
Come back, because we gotta clean up, man.

53
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:21,685
What the heck happened?

54
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:24,734
This is what happens when you don't make slime for months

55
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:27,148
you lose your ability, and you ruin everything.

56
00:01:27,148 --> 00:01:28,172
I've got new pants.

57
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,303
We've ruined the chairs.

58
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:31,198
But right now, we're gonna persevere.

59
00:01:31,198 --> 00:01:32,031
Is it good to go?

60
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:32,864
- Yeah, it's good to go.

61
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:33,935
We added some Sta-flow.

62
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:34,768
- We're gonna split it in half.

63
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:35,601
- Wait, bro (tearing noise)

64
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:37,207
- Okay, here we go.

65
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:38,988
Put it into the bowl, Devin.

66
00:01:38,988 --> 00:01:41,643
- Next up, we add these balls, and these smaller balls.

67
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,743
- Dude, I'm totally gonna win this round

68
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:45,951
because there's no way you can compete with me on this.

69
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:46,784
- And, done.

70
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:47,617
- No you're not.

71
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:48,450
- Yeah, I'm done

72
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,283
- Oh, all right, cool.

73
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,277
See guys, sometimes the greatness takes a little bit longer

74
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,420
than just mediocre averagness.

75
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,664
- Mediocre averageness?

76
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:55,497
What are you talking about?

77
00:01:55,497 --> 00:01:57,050
This is a perfect replica, of this.

78
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,041
- Dude, it's actually turning into crunchy slime.

79
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,286
(slapping sound) (laughs)

80
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,125
- Dude, I don't recommend that at all, but go for it.

81
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,578
- It's going inside.

82
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:05,935
That's enough, I'm gonna break it off there.

83
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:07,194
Get off my hand.

84
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,457
I'm just gonna squish it around in there.

85
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:09,785
Oh man, that perfect.

86
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:10,721
And then, now to get it out

87
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:12,918
you just tear the bag open like this.

88
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:13,781
It's pretty genius.

89
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:14,967
- Thanks. (sinister laugh)

90
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,928
Now it's time to add my milk with infused cereal

91
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,668
so we're gonna swirl it around.

92
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:19,797
Bad idea, we're just gonna (slapping sound)

93
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:21,761
All right, now for the main ingredient.

94
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:22,594
I got a technique for this

95
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:23,915
it's called, the light shake and shimmy.

96
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:25,162
I'm gonna squeeze it.

97
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:26,334
- It looks fine.

98
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:28,569
- Oh yeah, this is gonna be legit

99
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,057
because now my cereal is going to be unlike your cereal.

100
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:34,521
You gotta admit bro, this stuff is pretty awesome.

101
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,604
Look at that!

102
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,407
Whoo!

103
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,408
Yo, that looks crazy.

104
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,378
Now you gotta give it the one final technique

105
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:42,928
I call it, the once around the club.

106
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:43,761
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

107
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,156
(rope sound)

108
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:46,989
- There we go.

109
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:48,767
See, it's like a fashion statement on my arm.

110
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,727
It's called, the drop and plop.

111
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:51,762
- [Devin] Intercept.

112
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,674
(sad music)

113
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,652
- I'm sorry man, I just wanted to play with this.

114
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:57,994
Crunchy slime is so awesome.

115
00:02:57,994 --> 00:02:59,243
Whoa bro, what are you doing?

116
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:00,784
No, get your fingers out of there.

117
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:01,731
- I think it's time to call it quits.

118
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:03,232
I've done just about all I can do with it.

119
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:04,123
(tada sound)

120
00:03:04,123 --> 00:03:05,372
Now it's time to add the spoon.

121
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:06,838
You get to comment down below

122
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:09,784
and let us know who won, round one.

123
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:12,910
Was it my beautiful cereal, with all the infused goodness

124
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,506
or was it Devin's?

125
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:16,199
- That looks so awesome.

126
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,022
- Now we have the bowl of slime.

127
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:19,754
So what we're gonna do Devin, is add a little bit of yours.

128
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:20,587
- A little bit of it?

129
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:21,420
- Yep.

130
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,253
(crashing sound)

131
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:23,504
- Whoa, bro!

132
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,337
What are you doing?

133
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,184
- I gotta sever it with my spoon.

134
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,017
- Bro, why?

135
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:26,850
- Here's what's gonna happen

136
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,835
we're gonna add a little bit of the real food as well.

137
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,399
- Wait, why?

138
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,305
Bro, that's so gross!

139
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:32,595
- Because, at the end of this

140
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:34,797
we're gonna mix together, all the different slimes

141
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,937
all the different foods

142
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:37,328
and then we're gonna have to eat it

143
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:38,479
and see what it tastes like.

144
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,312
- Eat it?

145
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:40,145
- For this round

146
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:42,181
you challenges us to make a Starbucks frappuccino

147
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,488
out of slime.

148
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,321
(struggling sound) Oh man

149
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,362
my hands are not strong enough for this.

150
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:46,219
(screams)

151
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:47,954
- Well, leave some for me bro.

152
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:49,236
- Then, we got contact solution

153
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:50,455
because that's how you make the clear slime

154
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:51,538
if you guys don't remember.

155
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:53,701
This is gonna act as the strawberry base

156
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:54,850
to the whole thing.

157
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,980
I'm starting to get a little slime.

158
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,804
(laughs) That would be a funny name for a rapper, Lil slime.

159
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,102
Oh yeah, we're starting to get there.

160
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:02,307
I need more contact solution.

161
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:03,742
(screams) It stuck to my arm!

162
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:04,579
- Why would you do that?

163
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,582
- I'm dripping it!

164
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:07,334
- No, no, no!

165
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,167
- Now what we're gonna do

166
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,808
is we're gonna add some food coloring into the game

167
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:11,204
because if it isn't working now

168
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:13,600
it surely isn't going to work when we add food coloring.

169
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,794
I'll add some to yours.

170
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:17,574
- (disgusted sounds) It's all over me.

171
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:18,569
- We're just gonna mix it around.

172
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:20,701
- That turned real crimson, real quick.

173
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:22,826
That actually looks-

174
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:24,188
Whoo, this looks legit

175
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:27,265
like raspberry or strawberry marmalade.

176
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:28,988
We got that, now it's time to make my regular slime.

177
00:04:28,988 --> 00:04:30,405
We got some glue.

178
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:33,425
Now, I'm gonna add the Sta-Flo.

179
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:34,716
I forgot rule number one.

180
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:37,075
You're not supposed to add the Sta-Flo too quickly.

181
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:38,026
Whoopsie.

182
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,682
- All right, this is going great!

183
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:40,984
- Look how much Sta-Flo I added.

184
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:42,167
It's a Sta-Flo soup.

185
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,446
- This is still not looking like it's gonna cut it

186
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:47,234
so I'm gonna make this, some fluffy slime.

187
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:48,590
- That's so smart.

188
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,370
I need this to look fluffy and nice and frappuccinie.

189
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,345
Instead, it looks like a giant booger.

190
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:55,017
- Shaving cream.

191
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:55,850
It's a cloud.

192
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,183
My favorite slime.

193
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:59,822
- Dude, listen to the sound of this.

194
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:02,031
It's no longer all stringy and gross.

195
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,438
I've done the impossible.

196
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:04,703
I've made a full recovery

197
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:06,919
and I'm doing just dandy.

198
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,355
Now I'm gonna add some acrylic paint.

199
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,560
So first, you gotta karate chop it, to get it open.

200
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,414
- (screams) Bro!

201
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:13,247
So fluffy!

202
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,548
- That looks so good!

203
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:15,381
- Wait, how did you get a new bowl?

204
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,348
- (laughs) Magic.

205
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:17,767
- You smack the slime?

206
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,210
- Yeah, smack it three times.

207
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,043
(magic sound)

208
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:21,767
(both men scream)

209
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:24,312
- Now we're gonna dump some of my acrylic paint in here.

210
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:27,529
Dude, this acrylic paint looks insane.

211
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:28,520
Oh dude, it got on my fingers!

212
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,353
(sniffing sound)

213
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:30,186
(disgusted sound)

214
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:31,895
Holy cow, this stuff smells disgusting.

215
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:33,312
- [Devin] But, it looks like candy.

216
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:36,750
- Yeah. (coughing)

217
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,158
- [Devin] This is so cool.

218
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:40,574
- What happened to my beautiful slime?

219
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,161
My hands are ruined.

220
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:43,428
Dude, it's ruined my slime.

221
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:45,231
I think it deconstructed my slime.

222
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:47,153
- All right, first layer is done.

223
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:49,197
Next up, adding the fluffy slime.

224
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:52,793
- (laughs) I just smacked my face.

225
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:54,020
- I'm overflowing, no!

226
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,232
- This is my moment.

227
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,482
- Whoa, that looks so cool!

228
00:05:58,616 --> 00:05:59,449
- Look at this!

229
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:00,282
- Ew.

230
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:01,747
- Too much slime, I gotta cut it off.

231
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:04,008
(struggling sound)

232
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:06,735
- I'm gonna do it like this, my final layer.

233
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:08,332
- I gotta go wash my hands because they're literally pink

234
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:09,986
and it will contaminate the rest of my drink.

235
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:10,819
See, if I touch it like that-

236
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:11,652
- No, no, no!

237
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:12,485
Dude, why?

238
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:13,318
- It turns pink, so I gotta go wash my hands.

239
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:14,151
- It was perfect!

240
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,981
- I actually have a little bit of a different technique

241
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:19,083
for blasting my whip cream onto my drink, you ready?

242
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:19,916
Three

243
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,804
two

244
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:21,980
- No, no, no!

245
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,438
- Wait, first we have a five second subscribe challenge

246
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:25,755
for you right now.

247
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:26,966
Can you subscribe to this channel

248
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:30,461
and turn on the post notifications, in five seconds.

249
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:31,294
Here we go, you ready?

250
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,127
Five

251
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:33,063
four

252
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:33,896
three

253
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:34,729
two

254
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:35,562
one

255
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,395
done.

256
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,228
If you could do that

257
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:38,061
comment down below, Keyper Squad, right now.

258
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,045
Here we go.

259
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,378
Three, two, one!

260
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:42,405
- Really, that was it?

261
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:43,879
Whoa, bro!

262
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,937
Chill!

263
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,697
Dude, you're getting it everywhere, it's too much!

264
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,567
- Done, boom!

265
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:48,490
It's on top!

266
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,323
Whoo, that's fantastic.

267
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:50,326
Dude, it's like a little dragon.

268
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,819
(dragon sound)

269
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,445
All right, you gotta pop the top.

270
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:54,278
- Pop the what?

271
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:55,167
- Pop the top.

272
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a goner.

273
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,833
- (laughs)

274
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,666
Really, dude?

275
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,499
- Got it back.

276
00:06:58,499 --> 00:06:59,332
All right, here we go.

277
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:00,165
Crunch it.

278
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:00,998
(plopping sound)

279
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:02,912
- [Devin] I love the sound effects, to be honest.

280
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:03,945
- Pop the top.

281
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,219
Oh dude, look at that.

282
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:07,065
This is now my finished product.

283
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:09,357
I gotta go around the edges, scoop it all up.

284
00:07:09,357 --> 00:07:10,562
Here we go, top it off.

285
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:11,718
- [Devin] (screams) Whoa!

286
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:13,402
(slow motion sound)

287
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:14,817
- I mean, is that not awesome?

288
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:17,607
Oh my gosh, I've automatically won this round.

289
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:19,257
You can just comment down below right now

290
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,894
Collin's won the round.

291
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:22,215
(sinister laugh) I know.

292
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:23,048
I want to do that again.

293
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:23,881
That was so much fun.

294
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:24,767
(high pitch sound)

295
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:25,776
That's so cool!

296
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,589
Do not vote on what it looks like currently.

297
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,506
You're only voting on the very cool action

298
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:31,316
of the whipped cream popping out the top

299
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:33,659
that's all you're able to vote on, with my drink.

300
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,097
- I'm trying not to have the same thing happen to me

301
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:36,020
that happened to you.

302
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,853
(popping sound)

303
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:37,816
(both men laugh)

304
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:39,648
- [Devin] The finishing touch, the straw.

305
00:07:39,648 --> 00:07:40,481
Perfect.

306
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,234
- Off with the top, and in with the hand

307
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:45,084
and that's how you drink a frappuccino.

308
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:48,011
Now we're gonna add it to the bowl of slime and food.

309
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:48,950
So, we added mine in there.

310
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,466
Lets just add the whole cup in there.

311
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,144
And again, at the end

312
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:53,880
we're going to be eating a combination of slime and food

313
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
so stick around for that.

314
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,128
Right now, we are on to the next round.

315
00:07:57,128 --> 00:08:00,208
Egg smashing contest in three, two, one.

316
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,955
(screams) Wait dude, no way bro!

317
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:03,435
I was totally joking about that.

318
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:06,123
You guys challenged us to make a slime egg.

319
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:07,618
First up, we gotta crack our egg.

320
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:09,324
So, we're recreating this.

321
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:11,683
Whoever finished their slime first, wins.

322
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:13,218
This is not about good or bad.

323
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:14,619
Begin!

324
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,702
(fast forward sound)

325
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:25,484
It's pretty bubbly, bro.

326
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:26,317
I don't know what happened.

327
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:27,257
This is looking pretty-

328
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,691
- You good?

329
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:29,676
- No.

330
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,405
It looks like a clear liquid glass.

331
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:33,364
It might not be perfect

332
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:35,542
but we're going for the fastest round of all time.

333
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,242
Remember Devin, it's all about who makes it first.

334
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:38,586
Get off my hands!

335
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:39,419
Boom!

336
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,075
There's two ways to make the yolk.

337
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:41,908
You can either use the clay

338
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:44,659
or you can legit, take the yolk from the actual egg.

339
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,831
This is for the winning move.

340
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:47,095
(suspenseful music)

341
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:47,928
(plopping noise)

342
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:48,973
(screams) Yeah!

343
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:51,157
There you have it Devin, an egg of slime

344
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,196
or a slime of egg.

345
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:53,489
An egg slime.

346
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:54,453
All right, so I won this round

347
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:56,319
but you guys can still comment down below

348
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,152
who you think won.

349
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:58,703
But, I took home the victory.

350
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:00,064
You could put a couple egg shells by them

351
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:01,239
like I just cracked it open.

352
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,100
We gotta take the big ole thing of slime

353
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,436
I'm gonna pop an egg shell in there

354
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:05,376
and then I'm gonna mix up the yolk

355
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,766
into my slime, to see what happens.

356
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:07,599
- No.

357
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,992
- Wait, first we got a three second, like challenge.

358
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:12,563
Can you like this video, in three seconds?

359
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:13,396
Here we go, you ready?

360
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:14,229
Three

361
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:15,062
two

362
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:15,895
one

363
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:16,728
done.

364
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:18,711
- [Devin] That is so gross.

365
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:19,966
- That looks crazy.

366
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:23,580
This is now, literally slime mixed with food.

367
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,550
Look at that.

368
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,548
- I feel queasy.

369
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:26,443
- That's pretty gross.

370
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:27,927
After this next round

371
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:29,642
we're gonna be mixing all of this up

372
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:30,850
and literally eating it.

373
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,785
Don't do it at home.

374
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:33,388
We're doing it, so you don't have to.

375
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:34,632
(screams) Pie face challenge!

376
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:35,465
- (screams) No!

377
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:37,045
You can't play with my heart like that.

378
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:38,977
- (laughs) Okay, for this final round

379
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:41,559
we are making a slime pie.

380
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:44,494
We're definitely gonna need a lot, a lot of slime

381
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:46,714
to be able to build the entire pie crust.

382
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:48,256
Let me leave that there for right now.

383
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,182
Gotta unscrew the top.

384
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:50,015
(shouts) Yey!

385
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:51,479
There's always gotta be one in the video.

386
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:53,589
- Yeah, it took you a long time, I'm really surprised.

387
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:55,104
- I know, people were probably waiting for it

388
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:55,938
like, "when's it gonna happen?".

389
00:09:55,938 --> 00:09:57,302
We're gonna add a little bit in.

390
00:09:57,302 --> 00:09:59,193
- Nice, that looks like a lot, too much.

391
00:09:59,193 --> 00:10:01,527
Bro, are you trying to ruin it on purpose?

392
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:03,805
- No, you just have to evenly proportion it, man.

393
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:04,638
(overly accentuates) proportion.

394
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,471
- (makes a pronounced P sound)

395
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,899
- (makes a pronounced P sound)

396
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,708
- What are we, amateur beatboxers?

397
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,708
(makes a beatbox sound)

398
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,782
- I think you're spitting all over everything right now.

399
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:13,980
- This reminds me of the liquid water bottle

400
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,975
but one that you can not eat.

401
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:16,413
This is not edible at all.

402
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:18,796
- I think my slime is officially ruined.

403
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:20,028
Oh, why?

404
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:23,464
- It's very thick and resilient.

405
00:10:23,464 --> 00:10:24,884
(stretching sound)

406
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:26,686
(snapping sound)

407
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:27,924
- I can't tell if this is a blueberry pie

408
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:29,172
or a raspberry pie.

409
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,005
I have a great idea, Devin.

410
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,342
I'm gonna put this in the middle, and then close it in here

411
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:33,763
and see if I can break it.

412
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:34,610
- No!

413
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,169
- Holy cow, how did that happen?

414
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,132
I legit, did it.

415
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:38,980
- Okay, okay.

416
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,579
No, it's on my thumb.

417
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:43,613
- It's like little injections of color.

418
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:45,239
Whoa, that's super neat.

419
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,232
- It's like a mushroom.

420
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:47,810
- Some part is super dense purple

421
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,826
and then other parts haven't purpleized at all.

422
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:50,659
- Purpleized.

423
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:51,492
- Purpleized.

424
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:52,325
- I like that word.

425
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:53,933
- Oh no, I got it on my pinky!

426
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,221
Mayday, mayday!

427
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,518
No, it's all over my hands!

428
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:57,351
Gotta go for it.

429
00:10:57,351 --> 00:10:59,378
(screams) Oh, no!

430
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:00,211
Oh, no.

431
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,044
No, no, no.

432
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:02,128
Oh, no!

433
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,408
It burst on my hands!

434
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:05,074
Well, there you have-

435
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:06,687
(screams) This is never gonna come out!

436
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,564
(high pitched screams) I'm gonna go for a second

437
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:09,942
I gotta go wash my hands, bye.

438
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:12,338
- Bro, this is looking so cool!

439
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,606
- It looks almost like a galaxy.

440
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,852
I'm gonna use a spoon, so I don't ruin my hands again.

441
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,331
It looks kind of lumpy, chunky and funky, man.

442
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:19,481
- You take a bunch of this stuff

443
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:20,906
and you cut little strips of it

444
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:23,292
and then you lay it over, in this pattern.

445
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:24,630
So, you make it look like that.

446
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,070
- Dude, you do not use a knife in your hand.

447
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,319
I can't believe I'm the one telling you this

448
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,228
but you do not cut something when it's in your hand.

449
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:30,061
- Sorry.

450
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:31,794
- I'm just rolling this thing out, real nice.

451
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,977
Lets get saucy, up in this place.

452
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,580
The first strip.

453
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,663
Oh, it broke!

454
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,475
Dude, that's a metal knife of glass.

455
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:42,169
(metal scraping glass sound)

456
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,491
I can literally hear that scratching the table, Devin.

457
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:47,089
There, you have my pie.

458
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,141
It's like a little cobra coming out the top of it.

459
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:49,974
Well, I'm done.

460
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:50,807
I've just begun.

461
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,376
As with everything, let the time lapse begin.

462
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:56,209
(old timey music)

463
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:06,568
Here it is, the big reveal.

464
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:08,876
This was suggested by the Instagram Keyper of the week

465
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:09,724
so shout out to you.

466
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:10,693
And if you want to be shouted out

467
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:11,668
as the Instagram Keyper of the week

468
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,868
check the description down below, to find out how.

469
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,368
Right now, the big reveal, you ready?

470
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,100
Three, two, one.

471
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,231
Tada!

472
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:20,366
Bro, this turned out so good!

473
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:22,861
You guys get to comment down below, for this final round

474
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:23,694
who won.

475
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,019
Now it's time to add this to

476
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,825
the ultimate slime food versus real food

477
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:29,922
and then eat it.

478
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:31,495
Right now, lets see how they taste.

479
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:33,274
(both men shout) whoa!

480
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,760
- That's crazy!

481
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,846
Now, lets try it with this.

482
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:36,679
- What?

483
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,067
- (screams)

484
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:39,900
- No, what!?

485
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,733
- I shouldn't have done that.

486
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:41,566
- No.

487
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:42,399
- Pie in.

488
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:44,452
- Pie in.

489
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:47,053
- Now we're gonna mix it all up.

490
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:48,724
(both men shout) Whoa!

491
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:49,978
- What happened to the Starbucks?

492
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,251
We gotta get that cup out of there.

493
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,362
- Oh, that's so gross.

494
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:55,200
- This is the craziest combination of stuff, ever!

495
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,379
- Whoo, it smells.

496
00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:00,546
- I smell the Starbucks, and that actually smells delicious.

497
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:05,116
- It actually kind of looks cool, but it's kind of gross.

498
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:08,717
- It's all super cold, because the Starbucks was cold.

499
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:10,941
There's an egg in here too, I forgot about that.

500
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:11,774
Comment down below.

501
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:12,958
What are some other real foods

502
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,620
we should make slime versions of.

503
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,453
And comment down below, of course

504
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:18,548
who won the challenge, overall.

505
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,725
Here we go, time to eat it!

506
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:22,108
- (shouts) Whoa, whoa, bro, bro, bro, I have to say

507
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:24,682
I'm smelling this paint and it's really gross

508
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:28,309
and this is actual slime and glue, and Sta-Flo.

509
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,576
I'm pretty sure this is not good for you, dude.

510
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,943
I don't think we should eat this.

511
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:34,159
- You know what, you're probably right.

512
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,326
You guys should not eat slime

513
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:36,470
and I guess I shouldn't either.

514
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,165
I forgot, there's acrylic paint in here

515
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,383
it's all pretty toxic

516
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:42,353
so just take one last beautiful look at it.

517
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:45,745
And remember, safety, is of course, the first priority here

518
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:47,304
so don't eat slime at home.

519
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:48,910
I guess I won't eat slime either.

520
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,986
It did look pretty tasty

521
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:52,001
but it's definitely very bad for you.

524
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:57,038
Five

525
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:57,909
four

526
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:58,792
three

527
00:13:58,792 --> 00:13:59,625
two

528
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,458
one

529
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,291
done.

530
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,124
Love you guys.

531
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:03,345
(both men shout) Bye!
