1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,264
- What's up guys, it's Collins Key,

2
00:00:01,264 --> 00:00:02,972
and happy Thanksgiving hangover.

3
00:00:02,972 --> 00:00:05,461
Now I hope you guys had a fantastic Thanksgiving holiday.

4
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:07,616
And my favorite things about Thanksgiving is of course,

5
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:08,600
spending time with your family,

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,578
and also being able to eat as much food as you want

7
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,822
for one day and no one judges you,

8
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:15,053
it's absolutely amazing.

9
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:17,543
So for today's video, Thanksgiving kind of inspired me

10
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:20,385
and I wanna actually do a food eating contest.

11
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:23,041
I want to make this extreme, so to make it extreme,

12
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,053
I'm gonna bring along a little someone with me.

13
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:26,800
The destroyer of worlds!

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,154
(growling)

15
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,344
(laughing)

16
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:31,473
Devan Key!

17
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:32,306
- [Both] Hey!

18
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:33,264
- What up!

19
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:34,097
How's it going?

20
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:34,930
- That's probably the best intro

21
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,293
I've ever had. - Destroyer of worlds.

22
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:37,565
- Destroyer of worlds!

23
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:38,977
(growling)

24
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:40,126
- Turn up. - Yes.

25
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:40,993
- Come on, let's scoot over here

26
00:00:40,993 --> 00:00:41,826
we'll look better. - Okay.

27
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:42,659
- Alright cool, hey! - Hey what up!

28
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:43,492
- Now look normal.

29
00:00:43,492 --> 00:00:45,225
- For this pie eating contest, I brought along.

30
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:46,058
(laughing) In your face.

31
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:46,891
- A pie.

32
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:47,724
- A pie!

33
00:00:47,724 --> 00:00:49,583
And I have to eat this pie in one minute.

34
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,393
And the reason Devan is here, is because Devan

35
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:53,445
is going to be the pie defender.

36
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:54,288
His only job

37
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,391
is to make sure that I do not eat this pie

38
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:57,326
in that amount of time.

39
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,537
And the winner gets to slap the other person

40
00:00:58,537 --> 00:01:00,629
with some whipped cream in the face.

41
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:01,544
(laughing)

42
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:02,377
Let's do it.

43
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:03,210
- Give him some whipped cream.

44
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,733
- Oh no!

45
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:05,566
(can spurts)

46
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,785
(laughing)

47
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:07,841
It's like, oh shoot!

48
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:09,410
Dude it's like diarrhea.

49
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,530
Yo this is really necessary?

50
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,399
(voice track speeds up)

51
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:16,375
Yo!

52
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,269
Look at this!

53
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:19,048
There's no way I can eat this in a minute.

54
00:01:19,048 --> 00:01:20,206
(laughing)

55
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,332
There's no way!

56
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,450
- I'm so gonna win!

57
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,317
- Pie eating contest starts in three, two, one, go!

58
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:27,150
(grunting)

59
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,170
- [Devan] Okay.

60
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,003
(exclaims)

61
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:31,098
(Nerf gun shooting)

62
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:32,705
- You hit my eye!

63
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:35,122
(exclaiming)

64
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:37,906
Oh!

65
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:40,156
(laughing)

66
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,013
My eye!

67
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:48,263
(grunting)

68
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:51,602
(laughing)

69
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:55,952
- You laughed, you laughed!

70
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:07,761
- No!

71
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:09,763
No!

72
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,394
- Can't leave you alone!

73
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:14,561
(squeals)

74
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,719
(shouts)

75
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:25,469
- Okay, here let's see if we can get.

76
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:26,514
(laughing)

77
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:29,014
(toy singing)

78
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:32,619
That doesn't work!

79
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,869
(laughing)

80
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:36,956
Okay.

81
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,766
(exclaiming)

82
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,336
Oh!

83
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:44,392
I think we hit a minute.

84
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:45,562
I think it's been a minute.

85
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:46,667
- Alright, let's do it!

86
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,537
- It's been a minute.

87
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:49,768
- It's in my nose!

88
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:51,352
It's in my nose!

89
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:52,275
(gags)

90
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:53,555
- No, it's done!

91
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:54,388
It's a minute!

92
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:55,810
- That was disgusting!

93
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,273
Alright so Devan won this challenge

94
00:02:57,273 --> 00:02:59,746
and now he gets to do a smack hand with some whipped cream.

95
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,634
(sighs) I'm not excited about this.

96
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:03,046
I don't know how I was ever supposed to win this challenge

97
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:04,845
in the first place, this was impossible.

98
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:05,870
First of all!

99
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,920
That Nerf bullet!

100
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,065
It literally hit me right in the eye!

101
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,104
Like right in the eye!

102
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,222
(exclaiming)

103
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:14,745
And then you hit me with a sock right in the eye

104
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,603
right after that!

105
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:19,181
I couldn't see out of this eye for like a couple seconds!

106
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:20,881
Yo it's in my sock.

107
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:21,723
It's like in my sock.

108
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:22,941
This is worse than wet socks.

109
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,396
Look at, scroll down to all the mess.

110
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:25,644
Look at this.

111
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:26,477
- [Devan] Look at that.

112
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:27,807
- That's disgusting!

113
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,176
Look at those freaking apples.

114
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,009
- Here we go.

115
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:30,842
- Yeah!

116
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:32,550
(laughing)

117
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,626
- Look at all that loveliness.

118
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:34,938
- You guys please give me a thumbs up for this

119
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:36,247
because this is, this is like a smack hand

120
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:37,080
this is gonna hurt.

121
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,913
- Three, two.

122
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:38,746
(smacks)

123
00:03:38,746 --> 00:03:40,014
- Oh!

124
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,669
You got it in my ear!

125
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:42,502
(laughing)

126
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,240
It's like all in my ear!

127
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,305
What the frick!

128
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:46,891
Like I can't hear out of this ear,

129
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:49,105
I'm gonna get a yeast infection in my ear, bro!

130
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,884
- We are going for a smack hand part two,

131
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:51,900
because that one sucked.

132
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,297
Three, two, one.

133
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:54,130
(smacks)

134
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,990
(yells)

135
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,072
It got in my eye!

136
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:57,641
Oh gaw it's in my eye.

137
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:58,634
Oh!

138
00:03:58,634 --> 00:03:59,598
(laughing)

139
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:00,523
No way!

140
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:01,356
