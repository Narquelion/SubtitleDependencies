1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,057
- [Collins] Dragon fruit ink!

2
00:00:01,057 --> 00:00:02,553
- Oh my God! - Oh my God!

3
00:00:02,553 --> 00:00:04,730
- You challenged us to make giant edible markers,

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,120
rockets using a whole bunch of life hacks, so let's go!

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,310
- [Collins] This is the perfect life hack

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,750
for peeling apples, I'll be using these

7
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,620
as the eraser for my pencil.

8
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,440
- [Devan] This is the edible ink that's gonna go

9
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,790
inside my Sharpie, you ready?

10
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,550
Three, two, one!

11
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,470
- Ooh! - Oh!

12
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,970
- All right, now I just gotta grab a balloon.

13
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,803
- [Collins] Wait, you going for another one?

14
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:20,960
- [Devan] Yes, I'm going for another one.

15
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,268
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

16
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:24,935
- Aah, no! - Aah, no!

17
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,950
- That was insane! - Wow!

18
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,890
These are gonna be perfect ink capsules

19
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,210
for the inside of my sharpie.

20
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,960
All right Collins, I have a grand strategy for my sharpie.

21
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,317
This is an inflatable sharpie,

22
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:37,680
and it's not what I'm gonna be using.

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,130
- Okay but we're trying to make edible ones,

24
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,050
not just inflatable, that'd be - No.

25
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,910
- cheating. - So I have to make

26
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,670
a mold for the cap of my Sharpie,

27
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,510
so I have to fill this thing up with a normal,

28
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,840
boring garden hose.

29
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,490
- Oh so for mine, it's a much simpler process,

30
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,760
I've got an apple, time to freeze it,

31
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,380
and this will be the eraser for my pencils.

32
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,890
- [Devan] I ended up filling up the Sharpie

33
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,740
with a normal, boring garden hose.

34
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,780
- [Collins] Oh, gotta get a couple of these apples out,

35
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,613
here we go.

36
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:57,690
- Now, I've got my hot isomalt, do not try this at home!

37
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,680
- Yep, do not try this at home!

38
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,740
- I don't even know how you would.

39
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,940
- [Collins] Do you need any help with this, Devan?

40
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,773
- I got it! - Your hand

41
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:02,630
looks mighty shaky.

42
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,710
- Oh! - Oh, wait a minute!

43
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,820
The plastic appears to be

44
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,667
bubbling up!

45
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,903
- No, no, no, no! - Devan, Devan!

46
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:10,559
- No, no, this is gonna be the greatest cap ever, bro!

47
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,260
- [Collins] I can already see the structural integrity

48
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,100
is waning, Devan.

49
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,940
- I can already see your faith waning!

50
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,300
- You didn't have to come at me like that, Devan.

51
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,390
Time to smash some apples for my erasers, so here we go!

52
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,223
- Oh yes!

53
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:20,590
- Snag my favorite hammer. (godly light beaming)

54
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,050
How is this not gonna pop, Devan?

55
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,070
- I don't know, but we're working through it, just like

56
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,100
any relationship, you know?

57
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,688
- You're in a relationship with this giant Sharpie?

58
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:28,370
- No, no, just like, you know it's a metaphor.

59
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,500
- This just in! YouTube star, Devan Key rumored

60
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,130
to be in a relationship with a giant Sharpie marker!

61
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,300
- Rumored by one source!

62
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,150
- Himself!

63
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,983
- No, no!

64
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:37,050
- Back to you, Patricia!

65
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,440
All right, here we go, time for the smash, ready?

66
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,417
Three, two, one! - Two, one!

67
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,880
- Oh! - Oh my gosh!

68
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,140
- [Devan] I think it's leaking out of the bottom.

69
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,973
- [Collins] You hear that sound?

70
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:46,552
- It's like an ice glacier cracking, dude!

71
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:47,385
- [Collins] All right, now to make the applesauce

72
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:49,150
I just gotta gather up all the pieces of the apple

73
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,320
for the eraser over here.

74
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,790
- [Devan] I'm just gonna let this dry, then cover

75
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,620
the other side, and then I got my Sharpie cap!

76
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,020
- To make the lead of my pencil, I've got some

77
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,210
liquid nitrogen, and also a bath bomb!

78
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,043
And here's the thing.

79
00:01:58,043 --> 00:01:58,876
What are you doing?

80
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:01,200
- I have rigged up an old fidget spinner here

81
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,330
to crack some eggs with the tip of my pen!

82
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,320
- I can't even get close to it

83
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,153
right now, man, - Yes!

84
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:05,986
- it's going so crazy! - It is--

85
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,376
- Oh! - Oh!

86
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:08,740
- You can crack it into the bowl.

87
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,370
- Oh, you've launched another.

88
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,960
- Hey! I got one, that ain't bad, 1 out of 2 ain't bad!

89
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,793
- Yeah it's one out of three. - Wait it's one out of three.

90
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:14,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's a pretty poor

91
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,693
percentage, Devan.

92
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:16,690
- [Devan] Look at that, Boom!

93
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,870
- [Collins] I'm not really sure how this is a life hack,

94
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,590
it seems to make everything more complicated.

95
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,300
All right, well I've got my bath bomb here, and I have

96
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,120
a question, Devan. What do you think is gonna happen

97
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,953
when I drop

98
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:24,786
- No questions allowed!

99
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:25,720
- [Collins] Well, what happens when I drop a bath bomb

100
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,140
into liquid nitrogen, Devan?

101
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,796
Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

102
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:29,680
- [Devan] Whoa!

103
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,520
- I'm out! I'm out!

104
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,230
It appears as though it's, um...

105
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,063
- [Devan] It seems fine.

106
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:34,810
- Got a container of water right here, now it's time

107
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,080
to grab the bath bomb out.

108
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,571
- Here we go, three, two. - Here we go, three, two.

109
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:38,680
Oh wait! - Three second like challenge!

110
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,650
We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds,

111
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,490
You ready? Here we go.

112
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,400
- Three, two, one, done! - Three, two, one, done!

113
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,710
- You ready, three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

114
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,760
- Oh man! - Oh what?

115
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:50,215
(slow motion zooming sound)

116
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,550
(water splashing) - Look at that!

117
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,790
- [Devan] Did you hear the sound?

118
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,623
- I know, it was like whomp-whomp!

119
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:55,790
Dude, it's not dissolving the bath bomb at all,

120
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,623
look at this!

121
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:57,570
The bath bomb is untouched!

122
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,230
- Whoa! I'm gonna add some coloring to this dough here.

123
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,810
- Unfortunately, these are not edible, so right now

124
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,920
it's time for me to make a DIY edible bath bomb

125
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,850
that'll hopefully react in the exact same way.

126
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,170
- All right, well as you do that, I'm gonna add

127
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,240
a lot more food coloring.

128
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,600
- [Collins] we'll get some dry ice here, do not

129
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,910
try this at home, I'm gonna drop it in like this,

130
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,290
gonna add in a whole bunch of berries right now like that!

131
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,123
- [Devan] Wait, why?

132
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:13,956
- [Collins] I'm adding berries because I have to

133
00:03:13,956 --> 00:03:15,700
get a little bit of extra color for the lead tip of

134
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,920
my pencil right here, so here we go gonna add all those in.

135
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,150
I've got a whole bunch of frozen berries

136
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,983
- Nice! - and you know what time

137
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,370
it is, right, smashing time!

138
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,660
- It is! And you know what time it is for me?

139
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,520
To make the inside felt bit of the pen!

140
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,353
- Wait, what is this?

141
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:26,740
- I'm gonna pour it in and it's gonna do stuff!

142
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,740
- What a great description!

143
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,670
- There's a reaction to it. - Now, one to 10, where we at?

144
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,503
- Nuts!

145
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:31,336
- That's not even on the scale!

146
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,780
Now, before you drop that in, Devan, we gotta add

147
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,613
a little bit of magic to it.

148
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:34,446
- Oh okay. - So, here we go.

149
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:35,390
Bruh, like this! - Whoa!

150
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,105
- All right here we go, three, two, one, ah!

151
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:37,938
(blasting sound)

152
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:38,771
Okay, there we go! - Okay.

153
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:41,173
Three, two, one, ah! - Three, two, one, ah!

154
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:43,079
- You got it all over me! - Yes!

155
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,270
- You got it on me, bro! - I think I did it.

156
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,133
Well, I just need to stir it up a little bit.

157
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:46,443
- All right, well you know as you're doing that,

158
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:48,340
it's time for me to smash some berries, here we go.

159
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,193
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

160
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:51,026
- Oh! - Oh!

161
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:51,859
I think that works.

162
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,970
- I think so, finally got all the pomegranate juice,

163
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,940
now I gotta add this agar agar.

164
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,773
- All right, well as you do that,

165
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:57,920
I'm moving over your little triangle

166
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,290
of Illuminati-ness over here. (mysterious chiming sound)

167
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,560
We gotta really move that over.

168
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,570
Here we go, gonna flip it over,

169
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,750
make sure I don't spill any of it.

170
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,460
And here's the-- - You got a pan, I got a pan.

171
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,666
- Pan bros! - Yeah!

172
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,607
- You want some pans, we got some pans!

173
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:08,690
- All here we go, gonna take this, we're gonna flip

174
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,352
it over, and see if I can not spill any of it.

175
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:12,130
Here we go, three, two, one, yay!

176
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,730
On the count of three, I'm gonna lift this up

177
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,580
and this is a hack to make sure you get beautiful

178
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,070
colored dough every single time.

179
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,559
Three, two, one! - Two, one!

180
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,230
- Yay, whoa! - Whoa, man!

181
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,430
- That turned murky!

182
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,190
You know what, if I just mix all this together,

183
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,200
it'll turn back into normal lead color,

184
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,590
and then I won't have a colored pencil.

185
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,030
- [Devan] Well, I just gotta add this in here,

186
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,767
let it heat up, and then let it sit.

187
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,260
[smooth piano music]

188
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,820
- I've got some compressed air and now it's time

189
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,390
to freeze some bananas!

190
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,660
- [Devan] Yup, I've got my agar agar and now it's time

191
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,260
to roll it up, this looks delicious!

192
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,450
- [Collins] That's the inner lining for your Sharpie?

193
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,283
- [Devan] Yeah!

194
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,700
- [Collins] Life hack, always peel your bananas

195
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,240
from the bottom, this is for another layer of my pencil.

196
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,760
Yeet! - Yes, I think I got it!

197
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,720
All right, now this is definitely a life hack!

198
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,553
- All right, the bananas are right over here

199
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:50,450
- Whoa! - So, here we go,

200
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,160
it is time to freeze them up. - Okay, all right, hold up.

201
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,010
What, what, what? - Redemption yeet!

202
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,980
Yeet! - Whoa, that was close!

203
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,440
- [Devan] It's payback for how many times this thing

204
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,273
has been hit by you.

205
00:04:58,273 --> 00:04:59,680
- Since when are you on this dude's team and

206
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,513
not my team?

207
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:01,640
All right, time to freeze some bananas, here we go.

208
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,562
- Three, two, one! - Let's see them go

209
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:03,578
like this here. - All right,

210
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:05,160
well I have to make another batch

211
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,780
of this, cause this isn't long enough, what?

212
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,520
I'm making another batch, by the way.

213
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,770
- [Collins] I feel like a mad scientist over

214
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,006
here, man, just frosting bananas.

215
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:12,900
(laughing) You never know!

216
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,620
To make our giant edible Sharpie and pencil,

217
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,820
I think we got everything we need.

218
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,090
So now, let's put it all together.

219
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,990
We finished up the edible

220
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,823
marker and pencil. - Yup!

221
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:19,820
- Here is the big reveal!

222
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,653
Three, two! - Three, two!

223
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,350
- Oh and this video is sponsored by the makers of

224
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,590
Invisalign Clear Aligners, and we are so excited

225
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,560
because we both use Invisalign Clear Aligners

226
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,540
every single day.

227
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,140
- And you probably couldn't tell, but we're both

228
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,200
wearing ours right now!

229
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,330
- We've seen an amazing transformation in our smiles

230
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,450
and this is crazy, but the Invisalign brand

231
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,330
is giving away five free treatments to you.

232
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,830
Our Keyper Squad, so keep watching

233
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,900
to find out how you can win that

234
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,830
and a video call (victorious tune)

235
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,663
with Devan and I!

236
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:43,366
- Three, two, one, ta-da! - three, two, one, ta-da!

237
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:44,655
- Bro! - Look at these, bro!

238
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:45,488
- [Devan] I know!

239
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:46,570
- [Collins] Unbelievable, but the real question,

240
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,360
will they write and how will they taste?

241
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,570
And we'll be testing it and eating them

242
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,620
at the end of the video!

243
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,900
Rocket launch test!

244
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,500
- Whoa, man! - Whoa, dude!

245
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,473
- You've challenged us to make edible rocketships

246
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:56,351
that will literally fly!

247
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,184
[excited yelling]

248
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:59,540
As you can tell here, I have a mini bottle rocket

249
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,340
basically gonna add in a whole bunch of baking soda,

250
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,330
cork it, turn it upside down, and we're gonna see

251
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,640
how high it flies up, so do not try this at home!

252
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,540
Putting the baking soda in, you ready?

253
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,470
Three, two, one, let's get all the baking soda in!

254
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,590
- Is it capped? (excited yelling)

255
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,501
- Four, three, two!

256
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:11,334
No!

257
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:12,167
(laughing)

258
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:13,580
Are you all right?

259
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,565
It flew off and hit Devan! - Man down!

260
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:16,870
- Man down! - Holy cow I'm sorry.

261
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,873
Yeah Devan's done, man. - Oh!

262
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:20,140
- I gotta say though. - My stomach!

263
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,160
- In all fairness, it was you who flipped it over.

264
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,150
- [Devan] I failed us, Collins!

265
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,350
- [Collins] You did, dude, I think we've gonna have to

266
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,183
try that again.

267
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:28,240
Devan, are you prepared to do the flip?

268
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,440
- I am ready, Are you ready?

269
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,640
- [Collins] Yeah, I'm gonna do it tightly, dude.

270
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Three, two, one, go, go, go, go, go!

271
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,307
(rocket whooshing) (triumphant cheering)

272
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:35,678
- Yes! - That's crazy!

273
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:37,000
- Dude, nice! Dude look there

274
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,660
it flew right up and left the cork!

275
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,100
- [Devan] Look at that! I don't know why I should

276
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,310
be so excited 'cause that's your rocket and not mine.

277
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,430
- Exactly! I think that that's a pretty strong case that

278
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,840
mine is going to work!

279
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,380
- My rocket fuel, I have big block of wax and honey.

280
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,400
Ooh, look at this!

281
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,233
- [Collins] Very bizarre!

282
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:52,070
But I've got some eggs right here, some hot oil,

283
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,903
do not try this at home!

284
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:54,400
- Oh! - Oh!

285
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,237
- [Collins] Look at that!

286
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:56,920
- [Devan] Whoa, holy cow!

287
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,910
- But this is the insulation on

288
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,280
the inside of my rocket, to be honest,

289
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,950
I'm actually really surprised this life hack worked!

290
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,650
- Gonna extract some of the honey here.

291
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,730
- [Collins] I don't think it's gonna work, Devan.

292
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,970
You've gotten like 0.00% honey.

293
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,857
- That did not work, yeet!

294
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:09,500
- For a yeet, Devan, you didn't quite achieve

295
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,333
a lot of distance.

296
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,544
- I didn't fully commit, you know?

297
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:14,409
- Yeah, well see, when you yeet, you gotta fully commit!

298
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:15,330
Yeet! - All right, now I gotta

299
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,530
get this chunk into the inside of this.

300
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,640
All right, I've gotta say, I really

301
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,870
hope this turns out to be a life hack!

302
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,070
- Yo! - Yo!

303
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,903
- [Collins] Fluffy eggs!

304
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:23,170
- [Devan] It's like a balloon egg!

305
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,244
- Oh! - There you go!

306
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,807
Oh, oh, oh, that smell! - Yeah I gotta pop it.

307
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:28,750
- What you don't like the smell of eggs?

308
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,583
- No, I don't!

309
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,416
- [Collins] I'm just gonna kinda start

310
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,249
to just pull them apart.

311
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,200
This is gonna be the perfect insulation for my rocket!

312
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,470
We've got some liquid nitrogen

313
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,400
and now it's time to make a little bit more insulation

314
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,130
for my rocket, gonna add in some dots,

315
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,963
so let's see how this goes.

316
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:42,040
Ready, three, two, one! - Two, one, whoa, whoa!

317
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,400
That's too much, I'm guessing?

318
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,540
- I think I was supposed to like little driplets,

319
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,710
little drops, and I kinda wanna ham.

320
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,456
I wanna Ham FM radio on it, so let's uh.

321
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:49,289
(sting percussion)

322
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,490
All right, should we open it up a little bit?

323
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,460
- What? - I don't know.

324
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,963
- What was that joke? (laughing)

325
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:53,939
Was that supposed to be a joke?

326
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:54,900
- [Collins] Okay, it looks like the life-hack

327
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,830
might've worked, it's very fragile, so let's,

328
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,060
Oh! - Oh!

329
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,220
- [Devan] That is really cool.

330
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,053
- [Collins] Look at that!

331
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:02,280
It's like a Christmas wreath!

332
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,380
- [Devan] It's like a bagel!

333
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,060
- Can I hold it, without?

334
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,040
Ah, oh man! - Ah, oh boy!

335
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,920
- Yeah, that definitely, in hindsight,

336
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,770
it was too fragile for me to hold it.

337
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,910
I really doubt that's what you're supposed to do.

338
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,010
- Exactly, let's see if I just crush it,

339
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,843
let's see like this.

340
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:17,676
- Oh! - Oh!

341
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:18,800
- [Devan] That is really cool.

342
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,660
Now's the time to find out

343
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,180
if my technique actually worked.

344
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,573
Three, two, one, yeah! (triumphant tune)

345
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:25,150
It separated it, look at it.

346
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,220
- Not as much as just buying

347
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,180
a regular thing of honey. - Hey man!

348
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,180
- I'm just saying!

349
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,680
I'm gonna try to get a much thinner layer

350
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,631
going around, like this.

351
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:31,464
Ugh!

352
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:32,297
- [Devan] What?

353
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:33,140
- I made an oopsie!

354
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,600
- [Devan] Look at this, man.

355
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,530
I am definitely hoping that this honey works

356
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,363
as my rocket fuel.

357
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:38,810
- I call it the smack-a-whack-em technique.

358
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,010
You gotta smacka mack em (whacking noises)

359
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,318
and then you whack'n, whack'n, whack'n.

360
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:42,230
You know what, forget it.

361
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,063
Yayeet!

362
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:43,896
We're just gonna pour all that's in there like that.

363
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:45,140
- Look at this! - Bam!

364
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,930
- Whoa! - And let's see what happens.

365
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,273
- All right, what? (disastrous trumpet blast)

366
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:49,350
- What happened? - The bottle went in,

367
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,140
I dropped the bottle. - Was that on purpose?

368
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,000
This tofu thing was not the greatest idea.

369
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
I think there's a chance that they didn't

370
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,150
design this for honey.

371
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,670
All right, now I just gotta let this thing cook .

372
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,060
- I've got an anvil, some dry ice,

373
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,640
and now it's time to smash it, so here we go,

374
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,890
do not try this at home.

375
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,220
- Three, two, one! - Two, one!

376
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,828
- Oh, look at that! - Wow!

377
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,570
(crashing and breaking sound)

378
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,580
There ya go!

379
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,590
- That was perfect, look at it man!

380
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,070
It perfectly powderized! - That was crazy.

381
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,830
- As you can see these are cool bowl tricks.

382
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,760
Bam, like this and then, (swishing sound)

383
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,330
Bowl tricks. (swishing sounds)

384
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,490
Bowl! (metal clanging) - Are you still

385
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,330
on the bowl tricks?

386
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,877
- Ah, bowl tricks!

387
00:09:22,877 --> 00:09:23,780
- That's what you get.

388
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,810
- Woo! - Now it's time to see

389
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,660
if this will turn into rocket fuel, you ready?

390
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,540
All right - Should I like get in, taking

391
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,890
cover or anything? - The goal is for this

392
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,290
to be able to propel a rocket

393
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,123
into space. - All right well I'm gonna

394
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:32,308
step back a little bit, so.

395
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:33,440
- Did you hear that, into space?

396
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,700
- Yeah I heard that - Yeah, yeah, or atmosphere.

397
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,533
- I don't believe him.

398
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,353
- Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

399
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:40,810
- Gaborg! - Go mix, mix, mix, mix!

400
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,863
- Did I get it, did I do it?

401
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:42,696
- I don't know is it going anywhere?

402
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:44,209
- Aey! - Okay well that.

403
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,042
- Look at that! - Devan!

404
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,214
That will not propel a rocket anywhere bro!

405
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:47,047
- I know.

406
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:48,230
- [Collins] That's not even gonna get it off the ground!

407
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,063
- [Devan] I think I messed up.

408
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:49,980
- But in the meantime,

409
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,300
time for me to add this dry ice in.

410
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,133
So here we go. - Yes.

411
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,740
- It's time for me to drop some of this in here

412
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,990
and this is gonna be able to create

413
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,220
a cryofreeze mixture in here so here we go.

414
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,160
Three, two, one. - Okay.

415
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,870
- Oh, yeah! - Oh, man!

416
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,038
Well now it's time to drop in my vermicelli noodles!

417
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:03,871
- All right well here we go - Look at this!

418
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,090
- Go for it, three, two, one, go for it!

419
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,750
Yo! - Yes!

420
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,180
Dude this is gonna be perfect to create

421
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,660
the protective layer for my rocket.

422
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,870
Oh, it is overflowing!

423
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,410
- That's good it's like a magic trick bro,

424
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,610
the way it just like puffs up! - I know.

425
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,560
- It never gets old.

426
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,430
- All right, now it's time to coat the cacti.

427
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,710
- Oh, what was that? - Oh, look at that!

428
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,250
This is gonna be the body of my rocket.

429
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,200
- All right as you you coat that, I've got a shovel here,

430
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,280
time to slice off the top of the jackfruit.

431
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,460
Urg. (thumping sound)

432
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,333
Oh man! - Oh.

433
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,470
Look at this!

434
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,790
- [Collins] That's super crazy bro!

435
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,150
- [Devan] Whoa dude that's so satisfying.

436
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,520
- Three, two, one.

437
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,030
Oh my gosh! - Wow!

438
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,610
That was close, that was really close.

439
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,960
- There we go bam, all right one side chopped off.

440
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
You know what man, I'm actually going for more off

441
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,890
a "Star Wars" ship design for mine.

442
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,410
- [Devan] All right now it's time to reinforce

443
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,560
the outside with this indestructible ramen noodle mix.

444
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,970
- Is that the fuselage of your rocket?

445
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,140
- It is Collins.

446
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,730
- [Collins] Those noodles don't look too aerodynamic

447
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,563
I gotta say.

448
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:50,870
- [Devan] They won't be yet, but they will be

449
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,703
when they're in the air.

450
00:10:51,703 --> 00:10:53,070
- Now it's time to put the rockets all together

451
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,534
so first of all I'm gonna add my stuffing here.

452
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:56,330
Oh these eggs feel weird what?

453
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,390
- This turned out great!

454
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,983
- I know you really nailed it on that one, so here we go,

455
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:00,860
the egg is gonna drop, what? - Dude you gotta look at this.

456
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,950
This is mushroom foam.

457
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,670
- [Collins] No way, 'cause off camera Devan blended up

458
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,000
a ton of mushrooms and can't believe

459
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,157
this is what it came into! - I know right!

460
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:08,360
- I'm gonna add the eggs and they've definitely discolored

461
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,460
a bit which is kinda gross but luckily they're fluffy

462
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,680
so this is gonna be the insulation

463
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,600
for the inside of the rocket.

464
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,250
Next I'm gonna pick up some of these frozen dots

465
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,540
and just sprinkle em in like this.

466
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,960
- We got a ton of work to do, I got some painting on mine,

467
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,900
I gotta figure out how to attach these to this.

468
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,630
- I'm gonna get iceable coating to the outside of it

469
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,560
to make it smooth and probably have to reshape it

470
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,100
a whole bunch and yeah, it's gonna be a lotta work.

471
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,030
We got the edible rocket and these things turned out

472
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,430
absolutely incredible. - I know right.

473
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,760
- I was kinda worried there for a moment,

474
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,010
I didn't know if they'll be able to turn out

475
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,120
but the real question is not how they'll taste

476
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,690
but will they actually fly?

477
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,600
So here's the reveal.

478
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,500
Three, two. - Three two.

479
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,537
- Oh it's finally time to share how you can enter

480
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:40,230
for a chance to win free Invisalign treatment

481
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,060
and for us Invisalign aligners are really

482
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,080
the ultimate life hack because it improves your smile

483
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,730
without disrupting your life, like you can literally

484
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,530
eat whatever you want without having to worry about

485
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,100
the hassle of metal wires and brackets.

486
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,902
- Yeah and I've actually been using Invisalign aligners

487
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:53,560
for two years and you probably didn't know this

488
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,130
but I was always a little bit insecure

489
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,130
about my smile before.

490
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,620
So I did a ton of research and found that

491
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,350
the Invisalign brand has the most advanced

492
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,420
clear aligner system in the world by far.

493
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,460
And they've transformed over seven million people's smiles.

494
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,310
- And when it comes to our smiles and yours

495
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,620
we only wanna give you the best,

496
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,500
which is why we are so hyped that the Invisalign brand

497
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,467
is giving away free treatments to five lucky Keypers

498
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,100
and we'll be announcing the rules to enter very soon

499
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,933
on our Instagram.

500
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,660
- But in the meantime, we wanna make sure

501
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,880
that these five free treatments go to the Keypers

502
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,100

510
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,203

So sign up for the smile quiz right now

512
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
and let's see how these rockets look.

513
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,203
Three, two, one, ta-da! - Three, two, one, ta-da!

514
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:43,129
- What on earth? - Wow!

515
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,150
- We got the edible rockets and now it's finally time

516
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,680
to test to see if they can actually fly in the air

517
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,960
and reach the moon. - Oh boy.

518
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,128
- Yeah, reach the moon.

519
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:50,961
- That is the goal. - Exactly.

520
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:51,794
- If it doesn't reach the moon

521
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:53,980
it is a massive failure. - Exactly.

522
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,813
- We're setting the bar really high.

523
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:57,743
- Can you admire this custom yeet blaster here?

524
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,300
- Yeah Devon was doing a lot of research

525
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,570
on how we could launch these rockets.

526
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,830
And Devon feels this will be the best way to do it

527
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,830
With how heavy this thing is,

528
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,500
if this gets any flight whatsoever,

529
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,070
if it just gets of the ground one inch, I will be happy.

530
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,460
Which rocket should we launch first Devan.

531
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,360
- You know I think let's launch mine.

532
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,890
- Devan your pretzel's a little off

533
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,780
which means it's gonna traject that way,

534
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,620
it's not gonna go straight up, it's gonna be like that.

535
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,410
The more the moment comes, - yes.

536
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,060
- The less confident I am that these

537
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,307
are actually gonna be able to fly Devan.

538
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:23,240
- The more confident I am though,

539
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,900
this looks amazing - What, I don't know!

540
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,790
It looks pretty professional compared to mine

541
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,180
but on its own it looks pretty janky man.

542
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,280
- What are you talking about bro?

543
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,260
- On a scale from one to 10. - Yes.

544
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,250
- How confident are you, I want you

545
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,580
to put down your prediction right now.

546
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,880
10, meaning it's gonna reach the moon.

547
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,560
One meaning it will not achieve lift-off

548
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,740
and potentially combust.

549
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,830
I'm about a nine.

550
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,700
- What? - Yes.

551
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,019
- I gotta give it a four man, I'm not that optimistic.

552
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,140
I'm looking at it. - Yours is a four.

553
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,173
- No mine is not man.

554
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:48,950
- Yours is a four - It's squat

555
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,817
it is stout. - If I've ever seen one.

556
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:52,660
- And it is ready to make some action upwards bro.

557
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,493
- Are you kidding me?

558
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:54,326
- I am not kidding.

559
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:55,680
- All right now it's time to see this thing fly.

560
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,030
- But here's my major concern Devon.

561
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,810
My concern is that it actually flies, it goes

562
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,840
straight up in the air. - Exactly!

563
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,440
- And lands on my rocket.

564
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,760
- What are you kidding me? - Which would not be good.

565
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,593
So here's the thing.

566
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,010
- The chances of that are so low.

567
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,050
- It doesn't matter Devon, I will not allow your rocket

568
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,850
to destroy mine so I'm gonna have to protect my baby.

569
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,683
- All right. - So I'm just gonna go

570
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,900
over here. - Well here we go

571
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,380
and remember do not try this at home.

572
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,740
- Oh my gosh are you ready?

573
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,573
- Here we go!

574
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:15,406
- But before we launch the rocket

575
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:17,430
it's time to see how the Sharpie and pencil taste.

576
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,263
What do you think we're gonna go with first?

577
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:20,090
We go with mine first or yours first?

578
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,923
- [Devan] Let's eat yours first.

579
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:21,919
- All right so here we go, let's test it out

580
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,752
and see how it tastes, here we go.

581
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:25,733
Three, two, one - Three, two, one.

582
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:26,566
- Wah.

583
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,479
- Is it good?

584
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,312
(smacking lips)

585
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:29,470
- One moment. (laughing)

586
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,700
- [Devan] My arms are getting tired.

587
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,533
- Yeah here we go, - here we go, there we go

588
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:32,410
- yourself under it. - There we go, okay.

589
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,710
- [Collins] Time to eat the tip of my pencil.

590
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,930
All right here we go three, two, one just gonna get

591
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,930
a slice down like this. - Yeah okay.

592
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,510
- All right bam! - Oh wow!

593
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,343
- [Collins] I'm gonna go for this piece here.

594
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:40,840
- I like the blue one, I'm going for it.

595
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,550
- Now it's time to see how this tastes.

596
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,292
There we go, three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

597
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,928
(upbeat music)

598
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,340
- Hmm, hmm, mm!

599
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,173
- You did a good one!

600
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:49,480
- Wow. - This is amazing!

601
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,640
You did a really good job.

602
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,473
- Oh! - Yeah!

603
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,306
- Wow!

604
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:53,280
- That was really, really good.

605
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,550
- It got the whole banana. (laughing)

606
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,451
It's time to see if yours even holds a candle.

607
00:14:57,451 --> 00:14:58,284
- The main event.

608
00:14:58,284 --> 00:14:59,117
- What on here is edible?

609
00:14:59,117 --> 00:14:59,950
- The innards! - I'm looking at it.

610
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,883
- Collins the innards.

611
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:01,720
- That's it? - All right, here we go

612
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,831
Three, two, one.

613
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:04,150
(popping sound) Yup, okay. - Just ripped it off?

614
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,920
What on earth? - I know right!

615
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,417
So I'm gonna go in with these tweezers here.

616
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,250
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! - What?

617
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,290
- That's like, I feel you're gonna pop

618
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,123
a membrane or something in there.

619
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:11,030
- Yep, pretty much!

620
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,287
It's the edible ink of the marker.

621
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,010
I'm gonna put these tweezers in here

622
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,460
and just hopefully pop the thing.

623
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,293
- Go for it! - I'm trying!

624
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:17,126
(surprised trumpet blast)

625
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,041
No, no, no, no - Holy cow!

626
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,460
- No catch it, catch it! - I'm catching, I'm catching!

627
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,899
- Yes, it's edible! - Lift it up, lift it up!

628
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:21,790
- Okay, okay, okay. - That was.

629
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,623
I have an idea Devon - Whoa, whoa!

630
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,889
- I know how we can get more out of it

631
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:24,722
Here we go. - No, no, no

632
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:25,555
Why here we go, yeah, yeah, - No, no!

633
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:26,388
- Yeah, yeah! - Oh, Oh, no, no, no!

634
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:28,230
- There we go that's pretty awesome!

635
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,220
- Oh no I'm trying to catch it.

636
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,699
- Oh yeah you're doing a good job of catching it Devon

637
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:31,532
I believe in you.

638
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:32,365
- Dude put it down!

639
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,484
I'll try to hold this side of the marker, here we go.

640
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:34,317
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

641
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:35,459
- [Collins] Go for it, urg!

642
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,292
Oh man! - Yeah!

643
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:37,995
- Is it? - Yup, yup, that's it.

644
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:38,828
- What?

645
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:40,977
- It's the pomegranate agar agar that I made.

646
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:42,652
- I'm gonna dump this out real quick,

647
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:43,820
here we go, watch. - Oh yeah, yup, yup, yup.

648
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,653
- Oh! - Oh man!

649
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:45,713
- [Collins] You put paper towel in there?

650
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:46,546
- I did, I did.

651
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:47,480
- What to insulate it?

652
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,313
- Exactly.

653
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:49,146
- All right here we go.

654
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:50,220
Let's just unroll this - Oh, oh, oh, unroll it.

655
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,382
- Here we go, three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

656
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:54,215
- Ha!

657
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:55,048
- Whoa!

658
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:56,180
A second bite for approval.

659
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,760
- Redemption bro, I think that this balances out

660
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,727
the badness of this mam.

661
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,170
- Devan, think about--

662
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,003
Sorry.

663
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,140
Remember, this deliciousness we both thoroughly enjoyed.

664
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,050
Remember the reactions we had man.

665
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,560
- Yeah. - It was like, it was a lot.

666
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,810
- My memory's fading a little bit though.

667
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,390
- Yes I guess we'll just kind of like drink it?

668
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,350
- Yeah! - You drink it.

669
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,183
- It's ink dude. - All right.

670
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,970
- It's not like some dough stuff.

671
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,230
- Three, two. - Three, two.

672
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,180
- Oh and remember the Invisalign brand is giving away

Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

683
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:34,898
(upbeat music)

684
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:35,731
[Devan] Mm, mm.

685
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:37,122
(gagging) Mm, mm.

686
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,597
- Arg! (fist hitting metal)

687
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,430
Arg! - Mm-mm, mm-mm.

688
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,427
- Oh man! - Mm-mm, mm-mm.

689
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,110
- All right that's enough eating,

690
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,420
it's time to test the rocket.

691
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,852
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

692
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:47,689
(hissing sound)

693
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:48,888
- [All] Oh! (thump)

694
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,350
(laughing) - Man!

695
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,183
Oh and it

696
00:16:51,183 --> 00:16:52,840
explodes the bottle. - I mean, what is this?

697
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,610
- I couldn't make it work with all edible elements

698
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,850
so the coating is all edible but the inside unfortunately

699
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,060
is a plastic bottle.

700
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,040
- Are you kidding me this looks like styrofoam bro.

701
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,891
- And I used some styrofoam, so.

702
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:04,724
- What? - Dude you have

703
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:05,975
a bit of a plastic base.

704
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:07,413
- Yeah just a plastic base, that's not gonna--

705
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:09,447
- Yeah that's like essentially what I did.

706
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:10,330
(laughing)

707
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,960
It's not my proudest moment all right,

708
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,153
I just wanted it to work.

709
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:14,360
It even got like a foot of air.

710
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,070
- I gave her a four, that was way too generous bro

711
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,030
that was like a two man.

712
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,940
- Yeah I agree, that was really, really bad.

713
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,670
- And I gotta say I think it was some bad luck

714
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,770
'cause it flew right up and down onto the pipe,

715
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,700
which is like the worst place

716
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,040
it could have possibly fallen onto.

717
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,700
- Yeah, yeah, but at least it's edible.

718
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,130
After seeing how mine went,

719
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,590
I don't have a lot of faith in yours.

720
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,423
- Are you kidding? - Look I just don't

721
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:31,256
have a lot of faith.

722
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:32,700
- More weight means more trajectory Devon.

723
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,533
- Yes. - So here we go.

724
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,160
Next up, we gotta place it down over here.

725
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,510
- What are you doing? - Here we go I gotta find

726
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,640
the right point here.

727
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,000
- Your hands are all weird!

728
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,430
- See the thing is Devan, I'm more focused on the result,

729
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,020
not so much focused on my hand grip position, here we go!

730
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,330
- Did you get it, did you actually get it?

731
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,320
- What does it look like?

732
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,153
- I don't know.

733
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:48,070
- Yes, I got it - I don't know the inner

734
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,860
workings of yours. - There we go that's uh.

735
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,030
- Are you sure that's high enough?

736
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,940
'cause the other thingy.

737
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,987
- Oh yeah, yeah, I guess it--

738
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:53,820
(disastrous trumpet blast)

739
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,837
- Oh, it went down - What?

740
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:56,800
- Okay well I'm trying, I'm doing my best.

741
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,490
I'll figure all this out before it goes

742
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,490
but here's the question Devon.

743
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,120
Scale one and 10, what do you think my rocket's

744
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,030
gonna be bale to achieve?

745
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,140
- After seeing mine, I don't think

746
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,640
I can go above a one, - What?

747
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,473
- So a zero.

748
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:06,380
- What, come on!

749
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,710
- Yeah I mean I just had to be honest.

750
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,238
- Honestly, I think I can get a three.

751
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:11,150
- One.

752
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,409
- Which would be a win, 'cause yours got a two.

753
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:14,560
- I only need three to win. - Wait, wait, wait.

754
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,070
Who actually set the two. - Me.

755
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,580
- So I set this one then.

756
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,413
- Okay fine, yes. - You ready?

757
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:20,330
- I think it's gonna be below a two.

758
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,550
- See the thing is you know it's not fair when the judge

759
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,780
is already prejudging your work before it's even happened.

760
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,470
The one thing I will say, I'm a little bit insecure about

761
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,550
is the lack of a point on my rocket.

762
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,530
As you can tell, I've ruined the cone.

763
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,500
- Hey but it was all in good fun because we ate it.

764
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,060
- Yeah but see the thing is, it's now no longer aerodynamic

765
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,490
and it might capture extra air instead of being able

766
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,323
to slice through it. - Uh huh,

767
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:39,500
well it served a greater purpose.

768
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,547
- Exactly - It made me full.

769
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:41,380
- And it tasted good.

770
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,617
So uh. - Well not really.

771
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:44,620
- See the judge is already biased man he doesn't look

772
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,880
at my apple to begin with.

773
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,713
This is not fair.

774
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:47,590
Comment down below on a scale of one to 10,

775
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,551
how high you think this rocket will be able to go.

776
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:50,490
A 10! - Two.

777
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,580
So uh, less than a two, a one.

778
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,190
- I wanna see a lot of 10's in the comments guys,

779
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,930
comment a lot of 10's so I know you're with me.

780
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,910
So lets uh. - It's not gonna work.

781
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,820
Let's see how it goes.

782
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,690
All right here we go man,

783
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,630
- Do it! - I can hear it sizzling,

784
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,463
it bodes not good! - It's making sounds.

785
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:00,570
- All right here we go you ready?

786
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,668
Get behind me dude, get back - Yeah.

787
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:02,501
- over here, all right here we go.

788
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:03,610
And you know why yours failed Devon,

789
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,443
'cause you forgot to reet.

790
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,350
- Oh man! - So for mine,

791
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,410
I'm gonna give it the reet, here we go.

792
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,866
- Three, two, one! - Two, one!

793
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:10,699
- Reet! - Reet!

794
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:11,532
- Oh!

795
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:13,187
- I gotta catch it, I gotta get it.

796
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:15,680
- Dude, yours didn't go anywhere!

797
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,141
- What do you mean that this, this went to the moon.

798
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:20,070
- I'm sorry Collins, was that a bottle?

799
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,900
- Yeah well you know I had to put something in the middle

800
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,733
so it didn't blow up.

801
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:23,566
- Was this a bottle?

802
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:24,399
- It was!

803
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:25,232
- Did you cheat too?

804
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,740
- Just like you, I realized there was no way

805
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,790
this was actually gonna be able to fly

806
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,180
so we needed one inedible part so I chose a bottle,

807
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,580
I did not also go for styrofoam.

808
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,200
- That is hilarious. - Like you did

809
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,373
- You should also get points removed Devon.

810
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,480
You did a styrofoam, mine was all edible

811
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,740
besides with the bottle okay.

812
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,040
- I can't believe we both thought

813
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,873
we would get away with this.

814
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:40,780
- I know. - The only thing

815
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,920
that flew out was the bottle,

816
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,240
the rest of the thing didn't even fly.

817
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,073
- And the apple!

818
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:45,670
Here's the thing Devon, I wanna see how difficult

819
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,570
it would be to make this actually fly.

820
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,610
- All right. - I'm just gonna yeet it,

821
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,830
in this case give it a reet.

822
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,330
So I guess I'm just gonna throw it up in the air.

823
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,419
Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

824
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:54,252
- Yareet!

825
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:55,085
- Uh-oh.

826
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:55,918
- Uh-oh! - Uh-oh!

827
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:57,070
- Oh! - Oh!

828
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,970
- Well I gotta say those definitely did not work

829
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,996
as well as we would've hoped. - No.

830
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:01,270
- And if you want to see the video click right over here,

831
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,103
five seconds here we go.

832
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,336
- Five, four, three, - Five, four, three,

833
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,330
- two, one, done. - two, one, done.

834
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,410
Love you, bye!
