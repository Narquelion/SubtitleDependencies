1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:01,984
- Were combining pizza with candy!

2
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:03,882
- Are you kidding me? - Oh my gosh, I'm sorry man!

3
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:05,317
Well you challenged us to try a whole

4
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:07,400
bunch of crazy weird food combinations

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,233
that people love!

6
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:10,535
- And don't worry, I got another bag right here.

7
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:11,659
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

8
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:13,083
- Oh gosh, what was that?

9
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,919
All right, well we gotta clean all this up

10
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:16,099
we're gonna have to try these a little bit later

11
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,745
but now were onto our first weird food combination.

12
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:20,395
This weird food combination you challenged

13
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,383
us to combine a snickers bar

14
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:22,465
with a pickle right here.

15
00:00:22,465 --> 00:00:24,024
We've got a chocolate fountain as well-

16
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,857
- Oh yes!

17
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:25,690
- Which by the way I'm gonna give this a try.

18
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,154
- No, no, no you're not

19
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:28,589
you're definitely not giving that a try!

20
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:29,430
- You can't just take my straw.

21
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,667
- No, not before me bro.

22
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:31,638
- I got lots of straws.

23
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:33,492
- No no no no. How were you going to do that?

24
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,325
I actually want to see that.

25
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:38,477
- (imitates roaring engine) We're going to hollow out

26
00:00:38,477 --> 00:00:40,558
the pickles, fill it with all the snickers interior,

27
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:42,696
then dip it in this chocolate fountain right here

28
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:43,602
and see how it tastes.

29
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:44,563
Pickle juice box!

30
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:46,206
This is a new invention, man.

31
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:47,446
You could call it a pickle and a straw,

32
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:49,302
or a pickle juice box deluxe.

33
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:50,135
That's what I'm selling here.

34
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:51,292
- Wait, no one's going to buy that bro.

35
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,309
- Why, what are you talking about bro?

36
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:53,170
- No one's going to get, no.

37
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,264
- Big business opportunity Devan.

38
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:55,237
- We got to get to this next part,

39
00:00:55,237 --> 00:00:57,020
dude it doesn't look like you're enjoying this.

40
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,893
- Have you ever tried sucking a pickle out of a straw?

41
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,001
- Dude. - Sorry.

42
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,240
- You have so much spit.

43
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,350
I am on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what this--

44
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,183
(dramatic music)

45
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:05,016
- Ow, my eye!

46
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:06,153
We've got the nougat and the caramel,

47
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:07,565
and now we've just got to fill out the pickle.

48
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:08,398
- Oh!

49
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:09,231
- Is that caramel, whoa!

50
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:10,064
- Too much, too much!

51
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:11,270
Added too much, yes.

52
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,490
- Let's see, we're just going to inject it into the pickle.

53
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,323
- That looks weird.

54
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:15,276
You know, in my dreams it was a lot nicer.

55
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,331
- What, you've been dreaming about the pickles?

56
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:17,798
- No, not the pickles dude, the snickers.

57
00:01:17,798 --> 00:01:18,631
- News just in!

58
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:19,464
YouTube star Devan Key,

59
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:20,297
- No, no!

60
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:21,963
- Dreams... - Not even stop--

61
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:22,796
- Of...

62
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:24,081
- I do dream, I dream but not this time,

63
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,671
we're cutting it short, back to you Patricia.

64
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:26,921
Oh yep, oh yep.

65
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,419
- You had to get a full chocolate fountain

66
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:30,595
just to put a little bit of chocolate

67
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:31,636
on the inside of your pickle?

68
00:01:31,636 --> 00:01:32,469
- Well yeah, bro.

69
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:33,902
- Okay, here's what we're going to do, for mine.

70
00:01:33,902 --> 00:01:34,735
- Oh! - Ow!

71
00:01:34,735 --> 00:01:35,876
- Did you poke yourself?

72
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:36,709
- Nope!

73
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:37,997
We should say, don't try this at home.

74
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,110
- Just like poking number one,

75
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,003
you never poke towards yourself man.

76
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:42,095
- Poking number one?

77
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:42,928
- Okay, yeah.

78
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:43,761
- I've got to sticking some of this on,

79
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:44,594
- Whoa, hey man.

80
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:45,427
- Sorry, the peanuts are not...

81
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:46,263
- Hey, flinging peanuts towards me!

82
00:01:46,263 --> 00:01:47,191
I've got to fling peanuts towards you.

83
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,877
- (screams) That got in my ears.

84
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:50,603
Now I've got a peanut in my ear!

85
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:52,132
No I don't like that.

86
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:53,165
- Never happened.

87
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:54,257
- All right, here we go let's see.

88
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:55,104
I'm going to do this in a different way,

89
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:57,068
we're just going to take mine, fully submerge.

90
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:57,901
- It's like a boat.

91
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:58,879
- All right so it's finally time to see

92
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,864
if this weird food combination has any merit to it

93
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:02,261
and to see if it actually tastes good.

94
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:03,892
So here we go, let's get my pickle going over here.

95
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:06,392
- [Both] Three, two, one, ooh.

96
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,557
- Wow. - And goodness.

97
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:11,518
All right, let's cheers the pickles.

98
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:13,341
- Yeah, cheers the pickles. - Boom, all right, here we go.

99
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,424
- [Both] Three, two, one.

100
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:18,683
- Ow!

101
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:19,629
No!

102
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:20,618
- Oh, oh!

103
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:21,451
- No.

104
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:23,239
- Oh, uh-uh.

105
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:24,600
- Who likes this?

106
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,433
Who likes this!

107
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,830
- I will now, it's time to add it

108
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,768
to the blender of doom here!

109
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:30,160
So we're going to be adding every weird food combination

110
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,601
and trying it at the end of the video.

111
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:32,871
(bell dinging) So this weird food combination

112
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:35,355
you challenged us to combine grilled cheese with apple pie!

113
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,188
- Oh yes!

114
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,021
- So right now let's see if this tastes any good.

115
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,670
- Dude, I love apple pie!

116
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,211
- All right, there we go, cheese is...

117
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:41,157
- All right, all right.

118
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:42,641
- So I hate your apple pie, just a spill.

119
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:43,474
- It'll be made anyway.

120
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:44,307
- (squeals) Don't need that.

121
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:46,192
You know, I'm going to get some cheese off this thing.

122
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:47,719
- Whoa, that's like cheese noodles.

123
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,873
- I'm going to release the bread,

124
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:50,513
whoo, it got a little burnt.

125
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:52,392
We got hot bread, going to place some cheese

126
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:53,778
on the hot bread and hopefully pre-melt the cheese

127
00:02:53,778 --> 00:02:54,646
on the hot bread.

128
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:56,254
- Dude, I am terrible at this.

129
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:58,152
Do not have me make your toast in the morning

130
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:00,167
- Do you have ever happen to have Devan in your house,

131
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,000
in the morning.

132
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,833
- That would be weird.

133
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,499
- Yeah. Don't have him make your toast.

134
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:04,641
Here's the thing, I did this a little bit backwards,

135
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:05,739
but I don't think it's that big of a deal.

136
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,980
- Should we add licorice to this?

137
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,532
- Here we go, boom, slice of butter right there.

138
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:11,174
And then a slice of butter right there.

139
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:14,054
The last thing I have to do is add in the apple pie.

140
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:16,193
I've got to say that's much nicer looking than my slice.

141
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:18,889
- And now it's not grilled cheese unless you grill it.

142
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,535
Just going to move this front and center real quick,

143
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,778
like this, try and open it.

144
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:24,112
(both screaming)

145
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:25,610
- I lost a chunk of pie!

146
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,609
- That's bad.

147
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,585
- Excuse me Devan, only I can complain about mine,

148
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:31,198
all right, so here we go, I'm going to squeeze this--

149
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:32,617
You got the top on me.

150
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:33,450
- I did?

151
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,283
- Hey, you can't drop the top on me!

152
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:35,516
- I can maybe get some Pam on you too, if you want.

153
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,380
- You, shouldn't though.

154
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,555
- Now I'm going to add mine in over here, oh, it fits!

155
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:40,223
However, only barely.

156
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:41,500
- Okay, here we go.

157
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,166
Three, two, one. - I already did it (laughs).

158
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,559
- And then you just (beeps).

159
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,729
(elevator music)

160
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:48,881
- [Both] Whoa!

161
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:49,765
- That's pretty golden and just--

162
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:50,598
- Yeah-- - Perfect.

163
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:51,431
- Uh-oh!

164
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,264
Mine's starting to smoke,

165
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:53,097
mine is smoking.

166
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:53,938
Mine is smoking!

167
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:54,979
It's smoking a lot,

168
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:56,204
that's probably not um...

169
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:57,037
- Dude!

170
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,095
- Yeah well, I do my thing.

171
00:03:58,095 --> 00:03:59,495
(upbeat music)

172
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:00,328
- Three, two, one?

173
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:01,161
- Okay. - Yes!

174
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:01,994
- Here we go.

175
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:02,827
- Look at that.

176
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:03,697
- It burnt the paper,

177
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:06,415
that's not a good sign at all for my grilled cheese.

178
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:07,578
- I'm super proud of myself.

179
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:08,411
Look'in sweet.

180
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,244
- Good.

181
00:04:09,244 --> 00:04:10,077
Oh!

182
00:04:10,077 --> 00:04:10,910
- I don't want mine infected with that.

183
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,581
- I got to say, mine's looking pretty whack right now.

184
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:13,856
But Devan's going to be a much better example

185
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:15,350
of whether or not this weird food combo

186
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,376
actually tastes good.

187
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:17,209
(chiming music)

188
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,429
- It's like glowing with golden light.

189
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:19,324
It looks beautiful.

190
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:20,751
- Can I just like, not eat mine?

191
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:21,780
Time to see how this tastes.

192
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,863
- [Both] Three, two, one.

193
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,947
- Oh!

194
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:29,245
It's like biting into heaven.

195
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:30,250
Wow.

196
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,950
- I taste the fires of burntness.

197
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,370
Now it's time for the blender of doom

198
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,000
This will be mixed with everything else,

199
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,972
because we're going blending this up

200
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,036
and eating the weirdest food combination of all time

201
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:39,767
at the end of the video. (bell dinging)

202
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:40,600
For this weird food combination

203
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,028
you challenged us to combine Flamin' Hot Cheetos

204
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,013
with scrambled eggs, so let's give this a shot.

205
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:45,604
You, you're very civilized with that over there.

206
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:46,437
- Oh yes I am.

207
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:48,103
- Got to pop open the bag. (dramatic music)

208
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:48,936
- Oh! - Oh!

209
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:49,769
- There it is. - Man!

210
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,807
I'm not as good at opening up these bags as I thought I was.

211
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:52,640
Dump it out there.

212
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,646
- This whole time you thought you were good at that?

213
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:54,648
- I thought I improved man.

214
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:55,876
Because I haven't had an accident like this

215
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:56,828
in quite some time.

216
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,116
So have one of those things they have in the factories,

217
00:04:58,116 --> 00:04:59,637
like 6 months since our last accident.

218
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:01,165
- You're going to do some wall painting with that,

219
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:02,228
some cave painting.

220
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:03,855
- Yeah, I'll just add a whole like, boom,

221
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:06,212
on the wall like that exactly. - Yeah that's how they did it.

222
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:07,393
Man, they got Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

223
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:09,275
- I can imagine archeologists in the future coming by

224
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,562
and be like, "Yes, this was the Flamin' Hot Cheeto plans".

225
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,947
- Looks like there's some kind of crazy tiger running,

226
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,286
or is this a leopard, I don't know.

227
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:17,372
- That's a cheetah.

228
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:18,205
It's a Cheetos!

229
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:19,042
Leopard?

230
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,368
- I'm making waffles with scrambled eggs.

231
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:22,201
- I was just thinking to myself,

232
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,039
if only there was a way to add

233
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,394
a little bit more Cheeto dust.

234
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:26,099
Just got to wash my hands in some eggs.

235
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,673
- Ugh, that didn't work at all.

236
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:28,730
- I think you need to keep cooking it man.

237
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,181
I'm going to have to wash my hands because this is like,

238
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:31,140
this is looking nasty.

239
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,212
- I'm turning it up to the max.

240
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:33,143
Collins, I'm going to need you back,

241
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:34,905
my stuff's going to burn itself cooking and everything!

242
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:36,775
- Devan, I'm doing my best, but my hands are a nightmare!

243
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:38,069
This stuff ain't coming off bro!

244
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:39,013
- Bro, it's steaming!

245
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:40,404
- Okay well, my hands are steaming brother.

246
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:41,883
(screams) Wow that's hot, hot!

247
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,716
- Welcome back.

248
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:43,790
All right, you ready,

249
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,859
- No, I've got Cheeto dust on my chair.

250
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:46,843
I don't even know what you're--

251
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:47,742
- Three, two, one. - Wait wait what is--

252
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:49,045
(dramatic music) - Ta da!

253
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:50,629
- That's not even close to burning at all Devan.

254
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:52,295
- Yeah they do. - I've got this right here

255
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,128
- Oh! (dramatic music)

256
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:54,547
- Hot pan, what, what what?

257
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:55,488
It's time for me to make a crepe,

258
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,676
I'm going to pour this egg here on the top.

259
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:57,509
- All right,

260
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:58,755
now I just got to add my Flamin' Hot Cheetos right--

261
00:05:58,755 --> 00:05:59,588
(dramatic music)

262
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,039
- Oh snap!

263
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,872
- Are you kidding me?

264
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:02,705
- You got houdini'd!

265
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:04,295
You got to spin the wheel for another ingredient

266
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:06,276
which you're going to add to your weird food combination.

267
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:07,560
You know, I don't think this is actually cooking

268
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,818
the way I intended it to,

269
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:10,496
so we're going to have to turn this back over

270
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,486
and just dump the rest in here like this.

271
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:12,469
- Three, two, one.

272
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:13,854
That actually looks really cool dude.

273
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:15,571
- Oh boy, hope this is almost done dripping over here.

274
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:16,417
- Wait, what?

275
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,250
Tamarindo?

276
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,114
Dude, I have no clue what tamarindo is.

277
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:20,095
- I don't either man, it's got to be--

278
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:21,582
- Oh, this is what it is, I guess.

279
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:22,415
- What is that?

280
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,350
- I don't know.

281
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,720
- I'm going to have to go through a better process

282
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,498
of scrambling this. All right, so here we go,

283
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:28,925
I've got my scrambled eggs and hot Cheetos all ready to go.

284
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:30,479
- And I've got my tamarindo here,

285
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,197
I don't know how much you're supposed to add of this stuff.

286
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:33,455
- Here, I'm going to take a spoonful right now,

287
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:35,121
(bubble popping) I've got to make sure I get some eggs

288
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,009
and a whole bunch of them hot Cheetos.

289
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:38,391
- Why did you put your eggs in a waffle maker?

290
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:39,818
- Because it's awesome bro!

291
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,452
I want to make it look cool too you know.

292
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:42,392
You know, what I'm saying,

293
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:43,292
you know what I'm saying, you know?

294
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,287
- I do, yeah yeah.

295
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:45,418
Your elbow's very close to--

296
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:46,406
- Exactly yeah yeah.

297
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,490
- All right, here we go.

298
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,573
- [Both] Three, two, one.

299
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:54,153
- You know what?

300
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:55,070
You know what?

301
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,440
You know what!

302
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,273
Oh man.

303
00:06:57,273 --> 00:06:58,438
- When you taste the salt in it too,

304
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:00,219
you taste the spice as well.

305
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,971
It's also really fluffy too.

306
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:04,440
- These foods were made to be combined together man!

307
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,431
- Wow. - Wow!

308
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:07,903
- Now it's time to add it to the blender of doom

309
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:09,566
and remember we'll be mixing all these weird foods

310
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:11,691
and trying them at the end of the video. (bell dinging)

311
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:12,524
This one is definitely pretty bizarre.

312
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:15,412
You challenged us to combine a taco with a Hostess pie man.

313
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:16,245
- Yes.

314
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:17,907
- So I don't know how this is going to taste at all.

315
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,118
So you've got a soft shell taco,

316
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:20,083
I've got a hard shell taco.

317
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:20,916
- Exactly.

318
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,641
- So, let's open this thing up.

319
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,909
(chiming music) It's gone.

320
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,023
- Dude, you've got to get it though.

321
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:26,325
- It's actually really easy to get it Devan,

322
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:27,158
all you got to do is just clap.

323
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:27,991
- Okay.

324
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:29,463
(wind whips) - And it comes right back.

325
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:30,687
- Yeah. - So here we go,

326
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:31,577
boom!

327
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,631
That pie's been a little bit damaged

328
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,995
due to its extensive travels around the universe.

329
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:37,303
- This surprising fits into a taco so well.

330
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:38,812
- No, no no no.

331
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:40,127
I don't think you understand how this works.

332
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,704
The taco goes inside of this.

333
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:42,537
- Why?

334
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:44,240
- Because that's the weird food combo they suggested.

335
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,050
All right, here we go again, do not try this at home.

336
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:46,883
Here we go.

337
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,829
- Whoa, the jelly!

338
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,196
- I've got to say, these Hostess pies, crusty.

339
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:51,435
So here we go, going to use these tongs.

340
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:52,629
- Wait a second are you pulling that stuff out?

341
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:53,462
- Going to pull it out.

342
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:55,110
How else we going to get the taco on the inside, Devan?

343
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,414
- What do you mean, you break it in half. Look at this!

344
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:58,335
(triumphant music)

345
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:00,605
- So we're going to place jelly on the inside of the taco.

346
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,960
- Now I just pop this on the inside like that.

347
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,793
- All right.

348
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:05,477
- It's like a Hostess pie armor on my taco.

349
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:07,469
- Okay (beeps).

350
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,088
(Devan beeps, sing-song)

351
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,989
- It's now on the-- - Really?

352
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:12,325
Just, I went into a whole thing.

353
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,991
- Sorry. - Making me look like a fool.

354
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:14,824
- I'm sorry, what--

355
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:15,657
- You could have just gone with it man.

356
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:17,323
- You make yourself look like a fool. (both laugh)

357
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:18,461
- Yours just looks like a complete amuse bouche.

358
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,053
- Yours looks like a complete--

359
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:21,041
- Taco inside a--

360
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:21,874
- No.

361
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:22,707
- Hostess, - It does not.

362
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:23,690
- It's taco inside of a Hostess.

363
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,366
- You actually did a way better job than me this time.

364
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:26,199
- Thank you Devan.

365
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,032
- Good job, good job.

366
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:27,865
- This time?

367
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:29,191
All right, shout outs to everyone who suggested

368
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:30,358
this weird food combo.

369
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:31,191
And let's a--

370
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,024
(dink)

371
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:32,857
Dink it. - Cheers.

372
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:33,690
- It's been dinked.

373
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,773
- [Both] Three, two, one.

374
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,257
- You know what?

375
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:42,090
- Hmm.

376
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,923
This is a weird one.

377
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:43,756
- Give me a moment.

378
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,998
- There's a lot of flavors to break down here.

379
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:45,927
We got the cheese. - Yep.

380
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:47,048
- We got some onion. - Yep.

381
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:47,881
- Got some jelly.

382
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:48,815
- Can't forget the taco still.

383
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:50,777
- I have to say that was the first weird combo

384
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:52,712
that didn't seem like it was supposed to go together.

385
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,716
- But I will say, it did taste amazing.

386
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:55,549
- It worked.

387
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:56,601
- We got the blender of doom right here,

388
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:57,505
we're going to be adding these in.

389
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:58,845
Right now, we're on to the next weird food combo,

390
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:00,990
did you just eat my taco? - What, no it was mine.

391
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,751
- This next food combo involves chicken wings,

392
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,622
peanut butter and jelly.

393
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:05,555
And I think might actually taste amazing.

394
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:07,302
For the jelly, I want the jelly infused in.

395
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:08,747
I think this is going to be the best way to do it,

396
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:10,152
because I'll be able to inject this goodness

397
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:12,487
into my chicken wing, if I can suck it up.

398
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:13,320
Why are you painting it?

399
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,628
- What do you mean, why am I painting?

400
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:16,424
- We get it Devan, you're an artist. We get it,

401
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:17,402
you don't have to do art at every second.

402
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:18,772
- I don't but I just felt

403
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:19,976
like this would be the best way to do it.

404
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,482
- We're going to take the chicken wing and go right here,

405
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:23,535
in like this, I can feel it oozing down my fingers.

406
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:25,042
It didn't quite make it all the way in.

407
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,385
Can I borrow that, because I--

408
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:27,218
- Oh, wait.

409
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,051
Does that,

410
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:28,975
are you admitting that my way was better than your way?

411
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:29,808
- Yes Devan.

412
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,929
I will say that your judgment was marginally better

413
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:33,593
than mine for a very short period of time.

414
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:34,754
- I will grant you that.

415
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:36,258
- I got a hot peanut butter here.

416
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:37,250
Fully around it like this here,

417
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,122
boom!

418
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:39,854
- If you have a little bit of blurry vision,

419
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:41,858
you would never know that this had peanut butter on it.

420
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:43,533
I would just go like "oh yeah, chicken wing".

421
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,078
- It looks really shiny Devan.

422
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:46,284
Final point right here, we're going have to.

423
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,245
- You've got most of the jelly on your hand Collins.

424
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,361
- Well I'm going to suck my fingers.

425
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:50,859
- Okay.

426
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:52,287
- We all have different ways we eat.

427
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:54,278
- To each their own. - All right, here we go,

428
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:55,111
I'm just going to dip it in like this,

429
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,376
oh man, this is hard.

430
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:57,209
- Yeah.

431
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:58,594
- It looks like a meteorite chicken wing man.

432
00:09:58,594 --> 00:09:59,904
(both imitate incoming flight)

433
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,358
Boom! (fireball exploding)

434
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:02,596
And they just deliver this goodness.

435
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:03,429
- Yes.

436
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:05,513
- Mine is looking quite incredible man. (upbeat music)

437
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:06,346
Oh!

438
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:07,179
- Yes.

439
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,012
- I got houdini'd again!

440
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:08,845
- Yes.

441
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:09,678
- Okay, I guess it's time to spin the mystery wheel

442
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:11,835
to get one final mystery ingredient.

443
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:14,092
Hey, hey, you can't. Did you really need to do that bro?

444
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:16,105
You could have just changed the whole outcome of this.

445
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:17,275
I could have a got an amazing thing.

446
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,498
- But you probably didn't.

447
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:20,154
(both scream)

448
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:21,229
- I got caviar!

449
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,062
- Dude.

450
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,039
- That's like fish eggs on top of all this.

451
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,872
- That is going to be weird.

452
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:26,740
- All right Collins, I have your caviar!

453
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,102
- You don't have to hold it so close to my face

454
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:28,935
- Here you go.

455
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:29,768
- You don't, you don't have to hold it--

456
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:30,601
- You got it.

457
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:31,434
- All right, yes.

458
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:32,778
- It's for you, here you go.

459
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:34,561
Look at that.

460
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:35,444
- Fishy!

461
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:37,975
- That's not going to be a good match.

462
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:39,195
- It's literally fish eggs.

463
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:40,028
- Dude! - What?

464
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:41,549
- You could have done less. - Oh, gee.

465
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:42,905
- You didn't have to do that much.

466
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:44,077
- All right, here we go, you ready?

467
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,093
- [Both] Three, two,

468
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:45,926
- Oh, oh wait.

469
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:46,759
- Huh?

470
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,982
- (laughs) You're not going to wait?

471
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,174
You don't want to do like a subcall or?

472
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:52,296
- No, no, I think, you're subscribed to the channel, right?

473
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:53,599
If you're not subscribed to the channel,

474
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,060
I would recommend, subscribe to the channel.

475
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,893
- Go there now.

476
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:56,726
You've got five seconds,

477
00:10:56,726 --> 00:11:01,112
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done.

478
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,846
- Were you able to subscribe to the channel and also,

479
00:11:02,846 --> 00:11:05,655
- If you were able to, comment down below.

480
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,578
- That's kind of how that was so,

481
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:08,411
- Oh.

482
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:09,370
- Let's just see how this tastes.

483
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,755
- [Both] Three, two... - You want to try that again?

484
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:12,672
- Let's just skip over that.

485
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,005
- You want to start with two? - [Both] Two, one.

486
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:19,955
- Oh, no!

487
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:21,221
- Mm. - That fish!

488
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:22,054
- That is weird.

489
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:23,462
- Little fishy man, I want to go kapow!

490
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:26,175
(striking at imaginary fish) - There's jelly in here and,

491
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:28,624
but peanut butter's really good.

492
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:29,966
- No!

493
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:30,799
The fish man,

494
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,304
where it's swimming and I want to

495
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:33,988
no! - I wasn't a huge fan,

496
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,468
but I could get how someone would be a fan.

497
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:37,134
- I'm not a huge fan. That was brutal man!

498
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:38,675
The fish was nasty.

499
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:39,711
We've got the blender of doom,

500
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:40,610
time to add this in. - Yep.

501
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,732
- And again we're going to be mixing this up

502
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,620
into the weirdest food combination of all time

503
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,892
and eating it at the end of the video.

504
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:47,263
You challenged us to combine pizza with candy.

505
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:48,392
- I'm going to take this one right here.

506
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:50,058
- Yes. Okay I'm going to take this one right here.

507
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:51,292
- All right, they're next to each other.

508
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,439
They're brothers, just like us.

509
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:53,725
Next to each other.

510
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:54,667
- Exactly, yeah. - Brothers.

511
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:55,863
(fire burning)

512
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:56,919
- We're going to decorate our pizza

513
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,883
with whatever candy we want.

514
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,431
- Oh, you're starting with Gushers?

515
00:11:59,431 --> 00:12:00,403
I was about to start with Gushers.

516
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:01,236
- I'll start with Gushers,

517
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:02,272
are you sure you want to start with Gushers?

518
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:03,225
- Yeah I want to start with Gushers.

519
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:04,151
- All right, we're going to start with some Gushers,

520
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:04,984
here, see there we go.

521
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:06,550
A little bit of teamwork, a little fabreezing.

522
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,178
- I know we've done M&M's before, but you know,

523
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:09,843
it's always good to do it again.

524
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:11,220
- All right I'm going to open up this pack right here.

525
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,947
(both exclaim)

526
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:15,617
In hindsight, I can see how that happened.

527
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:16,450
- Oh.

528
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,283
- These are Redhots, to add some--

529
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:18,489
- Okay nice. - Some hot flavors.

530
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,004
- At this point, I think we've got our pizza slices ready.

531
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:20,837
- Wait, hold on.

532
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:21,701
- What?

533
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,130
- We're missing something, Snickers.

534
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,550
You know what, we'll just do one mini Snickers.

535
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,383
- Okay.

536
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:26,216
- And we'll split it, between the two of us.

537
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:27,049
- How tasteful.

538
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:27,882
So, now it's time to see how this tastes, ready?

539
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:28,715
All right, here we go.

540
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,068
- [Both] Three...

541
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,755
- Oh, you're good. - Just had a voice crack.

542
00:12:31,755 --> 00:12:33,838
- [Both] Three, two, one.

543
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:39,024
- Hm, that wasn't all that bad.

544
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,407
- Oh no!

545
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:42,053
Uh-uh!

546
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,507
(box clatters)

547
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:45,003
- No, you've got to clean that up.

548
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:45,987
- I will but, I, I...

549
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:46,820
Oh!

550
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,821
- Dude that was terrible, it was like all salty and stuff.

551
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,349
- Yeah in conclusion, hard no.

552
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:52,800
Man, all right just going to add in this,

553
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,633
a little bit of this in here.

554
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:54,466
- No, no, none of that man.

555
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:55,299
- All right, see we've got the blender of doom,

556
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,132
we'll be blending this up

557
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:57,092
and trying the weirdest food combination of all time

558
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:58,660
at the end of the video.

559
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,493
(bell dinging) This is probably

560
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,452
the weirdest food combo we've gotten.

561
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:03,185
It's grapefruit and wasabi peas man.

562
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,018
- What on earth?

563
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:04,851
- Oh, how about this? - What?

564
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:05,942
- We both try a different approach.

565
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:06,775
- Oh.

566
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,927
- I will make a grapefruit juice and wasabi peas cereal

567
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:10,801
and you do like a drink with the powder.

568
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,518
- First thing we got to do is juice up some grapefruits.

569
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:14,940
- Yep and first thing is I got to crush up some peas.

570
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,415
- Got to get me some wasabi peas, poof, fleet.

571
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,248
Hit the camera.

572
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:18,887
Those wasabi peas all ground up man.

573
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:19,791
- Yes. - In a drink?

574
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,996
That is going to have some intense flavors to it.

575
00:13:21,996 --> 00:13:22,892
- Oh man, yep.

576
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:23,949
- Wasabi peas are all going in,

577
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:25,940
this is going to be a very very interesting dish.

578
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,663
- Just squeeze out some juice.

579
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:29,460
Now I got to add in my peas here,

580
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,424
just like this.

581
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:31,514
- Okay, I don't want to get more of this dust

582
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:32,347
getting into mine.

583
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:33,997
You're going to completely overpower everything else

584
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:35,194
with just cotton candy.

585
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,635
- Shh, Collins, that's the point.

586
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:37,804
- Time to go for the bite on this thing.

587
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:38,637
You ready? - Yeah.

588
00:13:38,637 --> 00:13:41,483
- [Both] Three, two, one.

589
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:42,415
- Whoo!

590
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:43,332
Oh, oh, oh!

591
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:45,514
- Mm-mm.

592
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:46,347
Hm?

593
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:47,180
Hm?

594
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,013
- Oh, oh!

595
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:49,408
- Mm, um. (bird trilling)

596
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,241
- Woo!

597
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:52,644
Oh my eyes!

598
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:54,538
I spat it in my god--

599
00:13:54,538 --> 00:13:56,222
in my eyes!

600
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:57,509
I'm sorry, but come on.

601
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:58,342
- No, no!

602
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:00,267
- Verdict on that, whack!

603
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:02,080
Give it six stars of whackness.

604
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,864
Here we go, we've got the blender of doom

605
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:05,479
and this really is the blender of doom,

606
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,726
so we're just going to add in a little bit of,

607
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:07,587
- Oh, yeah, you just use your--

608
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:08,420
- Oh, there we go.

609
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,313
- We want cotton candy in there.

610
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:10,315
- Yeah we definitely want a little bit of cotton candy.

611
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:11,148
This weird food combination,

612
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:13,357
you've challenged us to try salmon with licorice.

613
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:14,190
Here we go.

614
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,023
- Slicey, slicey.

615
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:15,856
Looking nicey.

616
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:16,941
- Devan's making songs over there okay.

617
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,307
And then for the final piece,

618
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,534
going to lay this on top there.

619
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:20,570
- You're going to pour it on top,

620
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,529
but I'm going to skewer it and dip it in.

621
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,883
- All right, so the salmon is all prepared.

622
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:25,069
Now it's time to coat it in the licorice.

623
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:25,902
- Oh!

624
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:27,027
- Now here's going to start pouring it on.

625
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,258
- This doesn't dip very well does it.

626
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,142
- Am I getting it?

627
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:29,975
- Oh!

628
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:31,412
Whoa.

629
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,245
- That's a lot.

630
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,600
- Dude yours looks like a horror movie man.

631
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,789
- I know, right? (clown laughing creepily)

632
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:36,235
This is like some intestines.

633
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:37,699
- Three, two, one.

634
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:39,520
Yo, look at, oh okay.

635
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,616
I've got to say that I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon.

636
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:44,407
And a huge fan of black licorice. Grab a little bit of this.

637
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:45,240
We'll get a little bit of that.

638
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,073
- I want more licorice to be honest.

639
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:46,906
- Oh man, I got that licorice,

640
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:47,916
looks like a sophisticated dude.

641
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,775
Without a further ado, let's bite the lick... rice.

642
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:51,852
- Oh (laughs) what?

643
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:52,685
- [Both] Three, two,

644
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:53,820
- Wait, wait, three second like challenge.

645
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,998
We want to see if you can like this video seconds,

646
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:56,831
you ready?

647
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:57,664
Here we go,

648
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,833
- [Both] Three, two, one, done.

649
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,166
Three, two, one.

650
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:05,840
- (claps and screams) Oh!

651
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,746
- Holy cow.

652
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:07,669
- Oh yeah.

653
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:09,338
Now it's time to add it to the blender of doom

654
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:10,380
and remember at the end of the video

655
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,372
we'll be combining them all

656
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:13,066
and eating the weirdest food combination,

657
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:13,899
- What, what?

658
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:14,732
- Of all time.

659
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:15,565
Black licorice was way better.

660
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,342
No, no, no, no no!

661
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:18,413
- I got it! (laughs)

662
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:19,246
- Are you kidding me?

663
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:20,387
All right, well right now

664
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:21,533
we're onto the next weird food combination.

665
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:22,689
- (laughs) Mission accomplished.

666
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:23,522
- No!

667
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,987
For this weird food combo we're taking bananas

668
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:27,262
wrapping them in bacon and then dipping it in pesto sauce.

669
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,186
Got to slice of some piece of my banana right now.

670
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:30,927
And then next I'm going to be wrapping the bacon

671
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:32,285
around this banana right here.

672
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:33,240
- Oh, guess what I'm doing.

673
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,515
- Going to take the bacon right here like this,

674
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:35,727
the next thing we're going to be doing is dipping

675
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,096
this into the pesto and that's--

676
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:37,929
(upbeat music)

677
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:38,762
- Oh no! - No, that was you!

678
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:40,669
- Houdini, that was me! - That was totally you.

679
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:42,094
- Let's see what it is.

680
00:15:42,094 --> 00:15:43,203
Please be something good.

681
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,299
Please be something good. - Please be something bad.

682
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:45,908
- All right, so it's red, so let's see what it is.

683
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:47,499
Devan prediction off the bat.

684
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:48,332
- Real bad.

685
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:49,443
- Oh, I got Red Hots!

686
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:50,854
It's kind of like a candy but--

687
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:52,520
- It totally is. - But it's spicy though.

688
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,353
- Yeah, exactly.

689
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,315
- So like that's going to be weird. (candy shaking)

690
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:56,923
Red Hots.

691
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:57,840
I got them.

692
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:01,331
They're red hot.

693
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:02,856
- Your flow was so bad.

694
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:04,598
- (laughs) Thank you Devan, that's why I'm not a rapper.

695
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:05,431
I am a YouTuber. - That's good.

696
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,263
- So just going to have to go like this, here we go.

697
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:08,096
- Dude.

698
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:10,470
I forgot how good pesto smells.

699
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,303
Smell that.

700
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,136
- Whoo!

701
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:12,969
Smells interesting.

702
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,556
- I am going to put a nice spoonful on top of this.

703
00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:17,149
- Well I think I'm going to just dip mine in

704
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,333
and just go for a full dip.

705
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,638
All right, here we go, just going to push it in like this.

706
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:20,948
There's enough pesto on it, like that?

707
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:22,030
- That's going to be easier to eat than mine.

708
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,388
- Yeah, I think I'm just going to (squeaks)

709
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:24,501
(laughs) that's a sound I will make.

710
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,744
(squeaks amplified and distorted)

711
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:28,498
- All right, this is already really fun.

712
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:29,614
- Okay, here we go, what?

713
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,447
- This is weird.

714
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,070
- I think the pesto's probably going to overpower everything

715
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,660
but I mean, bacon can't taste bad

716
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,847
but the sweetness of the bananas.

717
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,329
- I don't know how this is going to taste.

718
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,245
- All right, here we go. - [Both] Three, two, one.

719
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:42,233
- Ah, that's hot!

720
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,131
Man, holy cow.

721
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:46,319
- Hey if it weren't for the pesto man, it'd be pretty good.

722
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:47,708
But (choking) time out!

723
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,985
(bell dinging) Tapping out.

724
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:50,209
- Now we have the blender of doom,

725
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,759
so here we go, time to add these in,

726
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,085
oh man. - Oh.

727
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:53,947
Why'd I do that pesto.

728
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:54,852
- And we'll be mixing all this up

729
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:56,653
into the weirdest food combination of all time

730
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:57,954
and eating it at the end of the video.

731
00:16:57,954 --> 00:16:58,973
So this weird food combination,

732
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,129
you challenged us to combine Fritos with caramels.

733
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,140
I'm going to start out by opening my caramel right here.

734
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,973
- Oh.

735
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:04,806
- Good idea, I'm going to do the same thing.

736
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:05,781
- Yeah, what you're copying me now?

737
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:06,614
- I am.

738
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:07,467
- Copy this!

739
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,088
(dramatic music) (candy scattering)

740
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:10,261
So Devan, how about you try that now.

741
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:11,552
- Okay, three, two, one.

742
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:12,765
(failing music)

743
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,431
- Oh man. - You've got to prep it right.

744
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:15,345
- Oh, sure, sure.

745
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:16,178
It's all in the prep.

746
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:17,011
- Three, two, one.

747
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:18,209
(candy scattering)

748
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,462
- I think it all came my way Devan.

749
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:20,462
- It was like a slingshot.

750
00:17:20,462 --> 00:17:21,306
- You try to melt these things down,

751
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,440
going to be a little bit difficult,

752
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,546
luckily I have a heat blaster over here.

753
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,321
- And luckily I have a plastic baggie.

754
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:27,987
(glass crashing) Going to dump this in here.

755
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:28,820
- All right, here we go,

756
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,077
just going to blast these things here, going to melt them.

757
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:31,446
(elevator music)

758
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:33,422
- All right, my caramel is nice and melted.

759
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:34,930
- Yeah mine is melted down as well,

760
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,497
I just used the a little hot plate over here

761
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:37,491
which worked much better.

762
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,217
For mine I kind of want to chop them up a little bit

763
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:40,911
so instead of just-- (bag crinkling)

764
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,181
I'm trying to talk and that's

765
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:43,137
- Sorry, yeah I didn't realize.

766
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:44,454
(bag crinkling)

767
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:46,479
- I'm turning mine into a DIY bowl.

768
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,692
- Take the caramel right now,

769
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,436
going to drip it in on top of the first layer of Fritos.

770
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,976
- Bowl, going to stand this thing up somehow.

771
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:53,272
- Here we go and then just going to mix them

772
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,175
at the same time.

773
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,230
- Oh, I got to get more of this.

774
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,896
- Here we go, let's get a spatula. Boom!

775
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:57,729
- Frito!

776
00:17:57,729 --> 00:17:58,697
- I don't think that they saw that.

777
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:00,518
I got to say, I think that in terms of presentation,

778
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:02,188
yours is definitely a lot uh...

779
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:03,028
A lot saucier than mine.

780
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:04,102
Because mine's just, what?

781
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:05,614
- Just did a quick taste of this stuff, what?

782
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:07,342
- You have like a string hanging from your mouth.

783
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:09,205
- Well yeah, because I just had some of it.

784
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:10,038
- It's on your teeth!

785
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:11,146
- I know, I can't get it off.

786
00:18:11,146 --> 00:18:12,273
- I've got to add one of these.

787
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:13,940
All right, here we go, let's see how this tastes.

788
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,023
- [Both] Three, two, one.

789
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:19,633
- Huh, oh, weird.

790
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:20,466
- Whoa!

791
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,299
- Whoa.

792
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,132
- Whoa!

793
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:22,965
- Ooh!

794
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:23,816
(triumphant music)

795
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:24,983
- Oh these are so salty!

796
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:26,354
And this is so sweet!

797
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:27,187
(clapping)

798
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:29,187
Oh my god. - Wow, wow.

799
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:30,023
- Thank you.

800
00:18:30,023 --> 00:18:31,222
- (cheers) Well now it's time

801
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:32,826
to add into the blender of doom.

802
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:33,659
- Oh yeah.

803
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:34,492
- And again remember at the end of the video

804
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:35,863
we're going to be mixing up all these weird foods.

805
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:37,239
You know, we're taking the whole thing right here

806
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,995
and turning it into the weirdest food combination

807
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:39,968
of all time.

808
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,182
The moment has come!

809
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:44,335
Time to try the weirdest food combination of all time!

810
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:45,168
- Yes.

811
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:46,904
- We've got it in the blender of doom right here.

812
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:49,229
- I like how the cotton candy on top makes it look

813
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,214
like it's nice.

814
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,996
But then you get all this and you're like, no, no.

815
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:53,829
- Yeah so this is going to be,

816
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:54,843
it's going to be a little bit funky.

817
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:55,676
- Yeah.

818
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,590
- We've got a whole bunch of weird foods in here.

819
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,020
Let's just, I'll pop the top on like this.

820
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,853
- All right.

821
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:00,166
- And you want to do the honors of turning on the blender?

822
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:00,999
- I guess so.

823
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:01,883
Three, two, one.

824
00:19:01,883 --> 00:19:02,716
(blender churning)

825
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:03,549
(both scream)

826
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:04,382
- There we go.

827
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:06,115
- My stomach is queasy from the last time.

828
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:06,948
- Yeah.

829
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:08,014
- All right. - All right.

830
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:08,847
- Done.

831
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:09,680
- Let's uh, let's see.

832
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,330
Just going to get a whiff of this.

833
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,163
Oh. - Oh.

834
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:13,459
- Oh man.

835
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,006
- That's horrid.

836
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:15,905
- Oh my goodness.

837
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,540
Let's do this, we'll leave the cotton candy on the top.

838
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,977
It could taste good.

839
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:20,696
- Not with the way it smells though.

840
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:21,529
- It could.

841
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,195
You know what, - The likelihood is not high.

842
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,028
- I think trying to drink this,

843
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:25,625
it's way too think to be able to drink so.

844
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,051
- Well, we've also heard that you guys find it very gross.

845
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:29,322
- Yeah, so we're not going to drink,

846
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,397
we'll do a spoonful of it.

847
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:31,748
Grab some cotton candy like this.

848
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:32,581
- Yep, okay.

849
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,546
- As well, as a whole bunch of that weird food.

850
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:35,791
I believe in you my dear.

851
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,100
- I don't think I want to cheers this.

852
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,197
- Yeah, all right, you ready here, three...

853
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:39,338
(upbeat music) - What?

854
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:41,144
- Oh no, wait a minute, houdini, what?

855
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:42,058
- No way! - No I was talking.

856
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:43,489
- Yes. - Oh my gosh.

857
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:45,706
- Okay, well, it couldn't really get any weirder than this,

858
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:46,539
could it? - Oh it can.

859
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:48,403
There are definitely some things that make this weirder.

860
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:49,236
All right. - Okay.

861
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:50,069
- So let's spin this wheel get

862
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:51,323
my final weird food ingredient.

863
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,813
Okay, three, two, one.

864
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:54,224
It's got a glove on it, so fleet.

865
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:55,764
Let's see what it lands on.

866
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:56,645
- [Both] Red.

867
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:57,947
- Let's see what we got.

868
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,246
All right, good or bad, what do you think?

869
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:00,079
- Bad.

870
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:00,912
I hope, I don't know.

871
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:01,745
- All right, well, let's see what it is.

872
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:02,578
Here we go, three, two, one.

873
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:03,411
Oh! - No way.

874
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,368
- Okay, wait, mystery box.

875
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:05,201
- Wait what?

876
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,034
Yes.

877
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:06,867
- It could either be a really good item

878
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:07,917
that could make mine delicious,

879
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:09,733
- Or it could make it even worse!

880
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:11,116
- Let's see what's inside the mystery box.

881
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:13,062
- All right the box is down, now it's (dramatic music)

882
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:13,895
Okay, okay then.

883
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:15,794
- Wait what, are you, Devan come on. You've got one job.

884
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:16,951
- So here's the keep it or yeet it thing.

885
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:18,734
Now remember if you can guess it correctly,

886
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:20,782
you can keep it or you can yeet it.

887
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:22,011
- You didn't even guess it correctly.

888
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:24,514
- Okay then, well you can choose to keep it or yeet it, yep.

889
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,760
- All right, just as regardless.

890
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,270
- All right, just going to reach my hand in okay.

891
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,103
- Okay.

892
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,129
- It's like down towards like the bottom (screams).

893
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,255
- It might be alive.

894
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:32,312
Was it slimy?

895
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:33,955
- Yes and it was like, large.

896
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:35,569
- We've found the giant squid.

897
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,153
- I've got to go like in from the top.

898
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,640
- I don't think you recognize what we said.

899
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,213
- There's now way you found a giant squid (screams).

900
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:42,046
- Okay, all right.

901
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:43,954
- (high pitched squeal) You don't like it.

902
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:44,880
I don't like.

903
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,808
- Can you guess?

904
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:47,223
- Oh, feels like an octopus.

905
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:48,959
(shrieks) Shouldn't have done that.

906
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:49,911
This is not a carrot.

907
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:50,744
I was going to say,

908
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:51,863
thought it was like a carrot, or like a ham link.

909
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,062
- No, it's not a carrot.

910
00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:54,728
- Sausage link. - No, definitely not a carrot.

911
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:55,561
- Would you know what happen if I squeeze it?

912
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:57,530
(screams) Oh, it's juicy.

913
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,377
- What happened?

914
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:00,245
- I'm going to say it's an octopus.

915
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:02,176
I'm going to be brave, I'm going to keep it Devan.

916
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:03,082
- You're going to keep it?

917
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:03,951
- Because, here's my thought.

918
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:06,044
Usually the octopus like a (screams).

919
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:07,327
- What? - You have your hand in there.

920
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:09,115
- I do. - Unbelievable.

921
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:10,781
- Let me see what it is. What?

922
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:11,614
What is that? - I know right?

923
00:21:11,614 --> 00:21:12,447
- Is it a hedgehog?

924
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:14,113
- It's like that isomalt stuff.

925
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:14,946
- Sodium alginate?

926
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:15,779
- Yeah yeah.

927
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:16,619
- That's why it felt so familiar!

928
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,696
I don't think I've ever felt this like outside of the water.

929
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:21,072
I don't know, I think we need to pull out my little friend.

930
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,698
- There you go, he's out.

931
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,949
- You almost popped him dog!

932
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,955
All right so here we go,

933
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:26,604
I think what we're going to have to do is take this,

934
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:27,607
kind of crack it open,

935
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:29,007
get some of the juice onto mine.

936
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:29,840
Please hold my spoon. - Yep.

937
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,506
- I actually thought it was octupus

938
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:32,339
I was low key getting kind of excited.

939
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:34,092
You know, calamari, maybe this could be like a sauce.

940
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,832
- That wouldn't go very well though with this stuff.

941
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,538
That's good, that's good, stay.

942
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:39,625
- Nope, I'm trying to overpower it Devan.

943
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,458
- It looks tasty.

944
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,827
- I got to say, this looks delicious.

945
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:42,907
- This looks so tasty.

946
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:44,366
- Without any further ado before it all drips off

947
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:46,324
and I'm back to the bad stuff let's and see how this tastes.

948
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:47,448
- [Both] Three, two,

949
00:21:47,448 --> 00:21:49,188
- Oh wait, if you want to win a 15 minute video call

950
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:52,350
with Devan and I text the word combo to 81800 right now.

951
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,775
So pause the video, text the word combo to 81800,

952
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:56,254
you'll automatically be entered to win.

953
00:21:56,254 --> 00:21:57,597
And let's see how this tastes.

954
00:21:57,597 --> 00:21:59,680
- [Both] Three, two, one.

955
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,772
(breathing and grunting)

956
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,285
- Mm-mm.

957
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:11,297
- Wait, it's actually kind of good.

958
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:12,130
- Uh-uh.

959
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:16,259
- (coughs) Hold on.

960
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:18,030
It's bizarre, it's like 50 different flavors there.

961
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,946
(Devan screams)

962
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:20,870
There's like one flavor will hit and I'll be like, oh yeah.

963
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,546
And then another one hits and I'm like, oh no.

964
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:23,379
- You're so right,

965
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:27,209
it's like salty, spicy, it's got salmon taste to it.

966
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:31,296
- It's truly the weirdest food combination of all time.

967
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:32,371
