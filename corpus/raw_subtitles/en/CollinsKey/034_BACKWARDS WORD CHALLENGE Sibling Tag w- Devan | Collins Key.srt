Now for today's video, before I go any further,

00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,017
please welcome my little brother, Devan Key.

5
00:00:08,017 --> 00:00:08,931
- [Both] Hey!

6
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:09,889
- What's up?

7
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:11,233
- Dude, how does it feel to be on my channel

8
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,608
for the very first time?

9
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:14,835
- I'm actually honored to be on this channel

10
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:15,795
for the very first time.

11
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:16,711
- This is Devin. - Thank you

12
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:17,788
so much for having me here.

13
00:00:17,788 --> 00:00:19,703
- Making his YouTube debut.

14
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:20,793
- Yeah, this is my YouTube debut.

15
00:00:20,793 --> 00:00:22,070
- Right now, he has never been

16
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,719
in any other YouTube videos before.

17
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,681
- Never been in a video ever.

18
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm actually kind of nervous.

19
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,242
- You're a little bit nervous. - Not really.

20
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:28,075
- Well you should be nervous

21
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:29,487
because we are doing a challenge today

22
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,624
and we are doing the backwards word challenge.

23
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:34,456
And actually Devan, since this is your first time

24
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:35,951
on my channel, I'll let you do the honors

25
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:38,599
and describe the rules of this challenge.

26
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:40,911
- Okay, so basically we get a word

27
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:42,841
and we have to say it backwards.

28
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,166
This app will reverse that, so saying it forwards.

29
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,268
And whoever is the closest, wins.

30
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:50,196
- That was actually very good.

31
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,029
Wow. - Thank you.

00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:53,345

For the first time on my channel,

00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:57,802
Devan did a great job right there.

36
00:00:57,802 --> 00:00:59,647
And now I'm also-- (laughing)

37
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:00,789
- Well this is the first time on.

38
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:02,025

39
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:02,858

40
00:01:02,858 --> 00:01:04,625

Yeah, I know.

115
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:04,677
- You (mumbles) to just put like wizard.

116
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:05,648
Can we just do wizard?

117
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,244
(Devan laughs) Please!

118
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:08,872
Wizardry is really hard.

119
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:09,948
No, I'm doing wizard.

120
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:12,497
Wizard, I'm keepin' it to wizard I'm overruling you here.

- Yeah, about that one. - Yeah, right.

124
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:20,914
- Since you did wizard, I'm gonna do wizardry.

125
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:22,135
You know, to make it harder.

126
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,479
- Great, yeah.

127
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,462

- Yer-Dri-Zaw.

136
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,469

137
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,234
My Yer-Dri-Zaw.

138
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:42,265

- [Phone] Fas-planus.

150
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,415
- You still got it--

151
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,627
- I think we should call it a tie.

152
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:11,632
Moving on-- - That was very kind.

153
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:13,316
Thank you. - You're welcome.

154
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:14,233
Iridescent.

155
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:16,582

156
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:17,415
Iridescent?

157
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:18,248

159
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:19,914
- Don't worry.

160
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:20,981
- No seriously bro, iridescent?

161
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,149
- Don't you worry.

162
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:22,982
I've got harder ones.

163
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:24,533
- Even me trying to say iridescent regularly

164
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,123
is probably not going to go into this right.

- Literally anything you do

182
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,751
is probably way closer than mine.

183
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:03,099
Next up is the wonderful buoyant animal, the kangaroo.

184
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:04,678
- Oo-Ra-Gek.

185
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:09,568
- Oo-Ag-Kenu-Kuh.

186
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:10,433
It's got the "kuh" in the end

187
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:11,758
so that was like a little hit some--

188
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:12,591
You just go for it.

189
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:13,424
(laughs)

190
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:15,565
- [Phone] Keg-na-roo.

- [Phone] Hus-bun-nek-ga-oo.

193
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:22,063

194
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:22,980
- Nailed it.

195
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,245
(laughing)

196
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:25,078
- At the end it was like--

197
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:25,911
- [Phone] Ooo!

198
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:26,992
(laughing)

199
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:28,008
- [Phone] Ooo!

200
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:28,841

00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:29,674

00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:31,371
- And next, you're up. - Repugnant.

203
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:32,386
- Are you kidding?

204
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:33,524
Repugnant?

205
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:35,593
Dude, how are we even supposed to get repugnant?

206
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:36,507
- I don't know dude.

207
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:37,676
- Ti-Nig-Yur-Burp.

208
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:38,862
(laughs)

209
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:39,945
Ti-nig-yur-burp.

210
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:40,800
(laughs)

211
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,121
Let's see how it is. - Ti-nig-yur-burp.

212
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:43,208
- Ti-Nig-Yur-Burp, let's see what it is.

213
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,409
- Hi, my name is Ti-Nig-Yur-Burp.

214
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,157
- [Phone] Prub-Yur-Gin-nished.

215
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:49,487
- It did just sounds like even more (mumbles) backwards.

216
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:50,320
(laughing)

217
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,620
Listen to it, it literally sounds like--

218
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,025
- [Phone] Prub-Yur-Gin-nished.

219
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,835
(gibberish)

220
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:57,835
(singing gibberish)

221
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,513
- Alright, cool.

222
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:01,346
We're good. - Alright.

223
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:02,179
- Alright, so we're gonna be moving on

224
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:05,895
since neither of us can successfully say this word at all.

225
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,641
Yeah, next is single.

226
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:10,572
For bonus points, you can add the word Pringle after it.

227
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:11,601
A single Pringle.

228
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,684
(laughs)

229
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:16,276
- I'll let you add that bonus word.

230
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,939
I'm just gonna try to get it right.

231
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,039
Guh-nis.

232
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,733
- Yo-Gu-Ings.

233
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,002

00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:25,593
- [Phone] Snug-goy.

235
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,562
- Sounds like snuggley.

236
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:27,621
- Yeah, it sounds like snuggley.

237
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,520
Okay.

238
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,735
- [Phone] Snug-goy.

239
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:32,745
- Something that does not happen when you're single at all.

240
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:34,207
So that's kind of ironic.

241
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,452
We were both pretty far off.

242
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:37,321
Negative one point from each.

243
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:38,771
- Yeah, wow okay.

244
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:40,562
Phobia is my next word.

245
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:41,479
- Are you kidding me bro?

246
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,129
You should know like, phobia.

247
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:43,962
- Yeah.

248
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:44,842
- You say it first.

249
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,492
- Okay. - Then I'll copy what you say.

250
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:47,431
- Alright.

251
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:48,619
(clears throat)

252
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:49,452
We did that in sync.

253
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:50,285
- Yeah. (clears throat)

254
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,118
(laughs)

255
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:51,990
- Ayi-Boaf.

256
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,907
- Ayi-Bofu.

257
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,404
Nailed it. - That actually might--

258
00:06:56,404 --> 00:06:57,237
- Hold up.

259
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:58,307
I got (mumbles).

260
00:06:58,307 --> 00:07:00,516
- [Phone] Uh-pho-bia.

261
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:01,599
- Oh!

262
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,909
- [Phone] Uh-pho-bia.

263
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:04,923
- It's a come up baby, don't you ever forget--

264
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,483
Well let's hear how your sound first.

265
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,689
- [Phone] Pho-bia.

266
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,183
(laughs) (sighs)

267
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:12,550
- I literally thought I won this one and then Devan--

268
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,821
- It can cause a tie but we're pretty close.

269
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:14,654
- No, Devan.

270
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:16,222
You distinctly one that.

271
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:19,234
My next word is redonkulous.

272
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:20,301
Which I don't think is even a real word.

273
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,199
- His favorite word.

274
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,094
- I used to say redonkulous to just

275
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,899
about everything. - Bro that's redonkulous dude.

276
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:26,063
- So we're gonna get it a try right now.

277
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:26,983
- Redonk--

278
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:28,212
- Redonkulous!

279
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:29,045
- Jeez.

280
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:29,878
- Sorry.

281
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:30,711
- That's my phobia.

282
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:31,544
(laughs)

283
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:33,752
- Donk is what gets it.

284
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:34,585
The donk and--

285
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:35,619
(laughs)

286
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:37,403
- I feel like you just picked this word to say and--

287
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:38,638
- Redonkulous!

288
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:39,471
- Point proven.

289
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:40,304
Okay.

290
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:41,137
Ulous.

291
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:42,650
Redonk-ulous.

292
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,759
- Redonkulous!

293
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,660
(laughs)

294
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,493
- It's back.

295
00:07:45,493 --> 00:07:46,503
This one's a difficult one.

296
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:47,460
Redonkulous. - I think your word is,

297
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,397
redonkulous!

298
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:49,230
(laughs)

299
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,688
- Distracting me man.

300
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:55,714
Sulos-kar-daw-er.

301
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,937
- That sounds redonkulous.

302
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:00,048
Se-ri-do-di-yur.

303
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:01,212
Redonkulous!

304
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:02,523
Alright, so let's give it a test shot right now

305
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,133
and let's see. - Alright, let's do it.

306
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,578
- [Phone] Re-do-yu-ris.

307
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:07,765
- That's pretty close.

308
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:09,139
- That is actually very close.

309
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:09,972
- Yes.

310
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:10,805
You go for yours.

- [Phone] Yer-hud-rak-sa-lus.

312
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,499
- That round was redonkulous!

313
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:17,810
- It's not redonkulous.

314
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,643
It's re--

315
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:19,504

316
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:20,864

00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:22,225
- Donk. (laughs)

318
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:25,539
- This next word is yek.

319
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,453
You'll see why.

00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:27,347

(laughs)

324
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:33,870
- What?

325
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,703
What?

326
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:36,844
- Alright, well.

You's a fool.

You are a fool bro.
