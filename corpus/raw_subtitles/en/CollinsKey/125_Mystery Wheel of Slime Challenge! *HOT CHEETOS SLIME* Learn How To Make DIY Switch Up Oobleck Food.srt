1
00:00:00,186 --> 00:00:01,048
- Slime Dump!

2
00:00:01,048 --> 00:00:03,042
Three, Two, One.

3
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:06,005
You challenged us to the giant mystery wheel of slime

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,023
challenge, let's go!

5
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:09,178
Time to spin for our first mystery ingredient.

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:10,011
Here we go!

7
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,241
- [Both] Three, two, one, spin!

8
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:14,233
- Predictions, right now, mine's going to land on yellow.

9
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:15,066
I guarantee it.

10
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:15,899
- Uh, purple.

11
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:18,067
- Oh I was so close.

12
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,713
I got blue so let's see what this is.

13
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:20,859
- You got blue, so did I.

14
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:21,889
I got white glue.

15
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:22,722
- [Collins] I got water.

16
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:23,555
- Water?

17
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:24,449
- I guess I'm gonna make water slimes?

18
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:25,522
I'm going to use one table,

19
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:26,669
what are you doing?

20
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:27,985
- What do you mean, I'm just a little thirsty.

21
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,172
- You can't be drinking my water!

22
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:30,005
- Why not?

23
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:31,053
- [Collins] That is not a lot of water.

24
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:31,886
- That's it?

25
00:00:31,886 --> 00:00:33,323
How are you going to make slime out of that?

26
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:34,541
Time to add my glue.

27
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,963
- [Collins] Dude, that's a ton of glue!

28
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:36,796
- Yeah!

29
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:37,629
- Next ingredient, here we go.

30
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:39,853
- [Both] Three, two, one.

31
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:40,734
- Yay, yellow!

32
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:41,682
- Oh, red.

33
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:42,646
Alright let's see what it is.

34
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:43,742
- [Deven] I got shaving cream.

35
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:44,575
- Okay this makes more sense.

36
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:45,408
White glue.

37
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:47,684
Finally, an actual slime ingredient.

38
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:48,538
So thank you.

39
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:50,334
- [Both] Oh!

40
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:51,933
- So I'm going to do 1/4 a cup of glue.

41
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:52,891
- Smells good.

42
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,044
- [Collins] Here goes mixing water and glue.

43
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:57,189
- Bro, this feels amazing!

44
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,508
Oh my goodness!

45
00:00:58,508 --> 00:00:59,751
- How'd you get all the birds?

46
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:00,584
Let me try it.

47
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:02,020
Yo, this is amazing!

48
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,876
(screaming)

49
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:06,641
- Dude you just didn't commit enough man!

50
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:08,224
- Time for the next ingredient so right

51
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:09,479
now let's spin the wheel.

52
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,287
Dude, wait you cannot spin the wheel

53
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:12,152
with your hands like that.

54
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:13,156
You will ruin the wheels.

55
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,871
You got your hands clean so let's spin the wheels

56
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:15,774
for the next ingredients.

57
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:16,774
Three, two--

58
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:18,585
- I just spun it bro.

59
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:21,764
- I'm going to predict that it's going to land on purple.

60
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:22,764
Oh so close.

61
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:25,014
- [Deven] I got liquid starch.

62
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:27,216
- And I got thermochromic pigment.

63
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:28,049
- [Both] What?

64
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,638
- I guess this is a thermochromic pigment.

65
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:30,471
- A thermo what?

66
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:31,304
- Slime!

67
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:32,198
Dude, this stuff is wild!

68
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:35,065
I can literally see, it might be like temperature changing.

69
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:36,650
If I put a finger in it, I want to see

70
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,718
if it'll change colors.

71
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:38,551
- [Deven] Alright.

72
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:39,384
- [Collins] Put it here.

73
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:40,217
- [Both] Oh!

74
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:41,050
- [Deven] Oh my gosh.

75
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,883
No way!

76
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:42,878
- [Collins] That is so cool!

77
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:43,792
- [Deven] No way!

78
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:46,250
- We're going to add three teaspoons in here, just not

79
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,083
too much at all.

80
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,777
Yo, this looks super cool!

81
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,090
One, two.

82
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,866
I cannot add any extra.

83
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:54,976
Otherwise it will be very, very, very bad.

84
00:01:54,976 --> 00:01:55,848
So here we go.

85
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,608
We are going to go there and done!

86
00:01:57,608 --> 00:01:58,952
- I mean how bad could it be?

87
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,970
- Deven no!

88
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,840
Oh my God dude I told you!

89
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,923
Not any more!

90
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:05,558
Alright, now its time to mix it around.

91
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,391
- Oh snap!

92
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,353
- I'm hoping I get some sort of like bonding ingredient

93
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:09,906
to put this together because its not slime.

94
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:11,342
Devan, pn the count of three.

95
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:12,175
One, two.

96
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:14,890
- You were about to say three.

97
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,723
- Three.

98
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:16,758
- That's not my fault, come on man!

99
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:17,591
- Alright here we go.

100
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:18,943
Yellow, let's see what it is.

101
00:02:18,943 --> 00:02:20,345
- Please, please, please be something good.

102
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:21,178
Yes!

103
00:02:21,178 --> 00:02:22,011
Liquid starch bro.

104
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:22,844
Yes!

105
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:24,544
Now I'm gonna have some slime that will maybe

106
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,063
change colors hopefully.

107
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:26,896
And what did you get?

108
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:27,729
- [Deven] I got food coloring.

109
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,113
- Aren't you like supposed to add the food coloring

110
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:29,946
in not now?

111
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:30,779
- Um.

112
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:31,998
- Well that just failed.

113
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:32,831
- No!

114
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:34,204
- Aye, aye, aye, let's go!

115
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,037
- I was so close.

116
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,511
- Time to add Sta-Flo!

117
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,177
- I got to be super, oh no no no!

118
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:39,010
- What?

119
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,843
- Too much, too much!

120
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,695
Whoa, that looks super duper cool.

121
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,463
I think its my favorite slime I've ever made.

122
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,081
Dude this is awesome.

123
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,560
- Bro, this looks so cool.

124
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,470
- [Collins] Yo, that looks insane.

125
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,116
- Oh my goodness.

126
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:52,608
- For once I thought I was gonna win.

127
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,132
- Its like blue marble.

128
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,053
Oh no I got it on my thumb.

129
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:58,735
- Ah I almost got it in my eyeball.

130
00:02:58,735 --> 00:02:59,568
- Oh snap!

131
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:01,010
- This looks like an alien man.

132
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,066
Like look at this, it's like all stuck to the bottom.

133
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:06,149
Whoa, this looks so cool!

134
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:08,364
Whoa!

135
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:09,768
Three, two, one.

136
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:11,243
Let's see if it changes colors.

137
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:12,229
- I can see it already.

138
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,062
- Is it changing?

139
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:14,101
Yes, a big flip.

140
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:14,934
You ready?

141
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:15,767
Three, two, one.

142
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:16,600
We went first.

143
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,433
Five second subscribe challenge.

144
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,690
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel and

145
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,028

00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:28,152
[Both] - Five, four, three, two, one, done!

149
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:31,590
You ready?

150
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,493
Three, two, one.

151
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:34,160
Oh this is so crazy!

152
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:35,877
- What?

153
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:36,994
- There is not enough Sta-Flo.

154
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:38,080
This is too slimy.

155
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,012
- I got you, here we go.

156
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,676
Oh no I'm so sorry.

157
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,251
- That was so much Sta-Flo Devan.

158
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,563
Oh man that might have been too much.

159
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:45,141
I think there is definitely too much Sta-Flo man.

160
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,392
It was so beautiful!

161
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,327
- I'm so sorry!

162
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,289
- I think I might have saved it.

163
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,431
It's like yellow right now but you guys remember how it

164
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:50,354
was all red?

165
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:52,011
This is all due to heat I guess.

166
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:53,616
If it's thermochromic, chrom--

167
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:54,481
- Chromic.

168
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:55,314
- Chromic.

169
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:56,147
It will literally change--

170
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:56,993
- [Deven] Dude that looks awesome.

171
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:57,826
- [Collins] So it's on the table.

172
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:58,659
- Alright.

173
00:03:58,659 --> 00:03:59,492
- Let's see if it changes colors.

174
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:00,325
- Alright.

175
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:01,158
- It looks like a giant blob right now.

176
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,165
Let's sped things up a little bit.

177
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:06,470
Yeah see it starts to go back to the red.

178
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,303
Now's the fun part.

179
00:04:07,303 --> 00:04:09,337
I want to take a cool pack and put it on and see if it will

180
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:11,044
change the color.

181
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,403
- I can see it!

182
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:13,361
- Yo hold up look at this!

183
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,194
- What?

184
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:15,027
- Look at this!

185
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:16,209
It's like red because it's changing the color of it.

186
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,893
- But it's stuck to the pack.

187
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:18,763
It's like lava.

188
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:19,596
- Holy cow!

189
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:21,447
Look at it, you can see it changing immediately.

190
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,238
Alright we'll take a little piece of the yellow.

191
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:24,342
Gonna pop it on like this.

192
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:25,757
Then look, it's gonna change red.

193
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:27,340
Wow that's so cool!

194
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,983
- Dude!

195
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,528
- Alright now, I've got a hot pack right over here.

196
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:32,361
Alright here we go.

197
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:33,517
Let's see if the hot pack can heat it up.

198
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:35,603
Kind of at the top and then it goes right back.

199
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:37,411
The cold is definitely winning.

200
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,902
- Alright, now mine might not change color but mine

201
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:42,653
is extremely soft so I bet you if you use this as a

202
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,656
pillow you'd be able to fall right asleep.

203
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:45,489
- There's no way dude.

204
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:46,403
- Oh yeah there is.

205
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:47,236
Just watch.

206
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:48,072
(thudding)

207
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:49,137
(snoring)

208
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:49,970
- Collins!

209
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,887
- That was like loud in my ear.

210
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:52,704
So these are the final slime.

211
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:54,024
But you guys get to comment down below

212
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:55,809
Whose slime do you think won?

213
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,174
And right now it's time to make that

214
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:58,700
next mystery wheel slime.

215
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,223
So right now, let's go.

216
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:02,459
Alright Deven, time to spin the wheels again.

217
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:03,568
Why would you do that?

218
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:04,401
We need that.

219
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:05,234
Alright don't worry I'll get it back.

220
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:07,671
So right now, let's spin the wheels, you ready?

221
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:08,830
- [Both] Three, two, one.

222
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,353
- Let's see what I'm going to land on.

223
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,186
Green.

224
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,494
- Red.

225
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:14,530
Bro, I got iron.

226
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,621
How do you make stuff out of iron?

227
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:17,689
- I got foam beads.

228
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:18,574
No, no, no.

229
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:20,208
You cannot just handle that regularly.

230
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,114
Set it down.

231
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:22,777
We need to get you some protective gloves.

232
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:23,610
Okay, so let's try this.

233
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,186
Yo, those look great!

234
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:26,019
- What?

235
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:26,852
- Those are perfect.

236
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:28,079
- I'm pretty sure these are not the right gloves.

237
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,540
- No you'll be completely safe now.

238
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,856
There is no way the iron is getting through those gloves.

239
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:33,676
- I don't think I can even open up the bag dude.

240
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:34,902
- Just open up this for me.

241
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,602
- I can't but I can punch it.

242
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,801
- Well I needed that!

243
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:39,144
We'll get you some other gloves don't worry.

244
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:40,988
Oh there we go!

245
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:42,905
- Dude that's my glove.

246
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:46,254
- There, two, one.

247
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:48,013
Bam, there you go, you got your other glove.

248
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:51,733
- You couldn't have put it on better dude?

249
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,085
- [Deven] Look at that!

250
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:53,918
- [Collins] Oh my gosh.

251
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,305
Is that legit iron?

252
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:56,138
- [Deven] Yeah!

253
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:57,897
- Three, two, one.

254
00:05:57,897 --> 00:05:59,676
- I hope it's something good because right now I have no

255
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,037
idea what's going to make this work.

256
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:03,542
- Ooh we've got blue, let's see what it is.

257
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:04,511
- [Deven] Liquid starch for me.

258
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:05,904
- And I got clear glue.

259
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:07,122
Here we go, got the clear glue.

260
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:09,744
Just gonna add a whole bunch in.

261
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,196
That's gonna be a ton of slime.

262
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:12,394
- Gotta be very precise.

263
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:13,341
I don't want to mess this up.

264
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:16,031
I have a feeling with such a rare item like iron.

265
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:19,781
This has gotta be some sort of special slime.

266
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:21,650
- What did you do?

267
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,695
- It almost flew out.

268
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:24,201
- It kind of reminds me of like DNA strands.

269
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,826
Like how they are all clumped together like this.

270
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:26,659
- Oh yeah.

271
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:27,492
- Ready to give it a spin Devon?

272
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:28,925
- I'm ready. - Three, two, one.

273
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:29,857
Spin.

274
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:30,690
- Ah yellow.

275
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,789
- Ah, ah, ah

276
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:32,712
Alright I've got cornstarch.

277
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:33,879
- [Deven] And I got white glue.

278
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,712
- Nice!

279
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:35,545
- Wow!

280
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:36,749
- So time to add in my Sta-Flo.

281
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:38,537
- Oh I think I need more glue.

282
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:39,370
Okay.

283
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,120
Alright, there we go.

284
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:44,757
Mine's turning some sort of gray.

285
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:45,662
- That's kind of crazy.

286
00:06:45,662 --> 00:06:48,191
Yo, mine's actually turning out really good!

287
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,056
Holy cow!

288
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:50,728
It looks like a slime cereal.

289
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:52,295
You know when you run out of milk and then you have to

290
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:53,322
use water instead of milk?

291
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:55,862
I wonder if yours like actually gonna be magnetic?

292
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:56,695
' Cause its iron dude!

293
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,907
- Oh you're right!

294
00:06:58,907 --> 00:06:59,783
- Whoa!

295
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:00,741
- This is so cool!

296
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:01,647
- Wait I want to grab some.

297
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:02,480
- Oh snap!

298
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,638
It's like the longest slime stretch I've ever had!

299
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:06,607
It's stuck to my glove.

300
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,192
- Get it off, get it off, get it off!

301
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:10,395
It's the infinity gauntlet and I'm Thanos.

302
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:13,036
- Wait dude, it totally is like the infinity gauntlet, bro.

303
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,134
- Check this out!

304
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,626
Oh Devan, Devan, where'd you go?

305
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,832
Gosh oh man this infinity gauntlet thing is not for me.

306
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:18,665
How do I get him back?

307
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:19,854
I guess the only way is to like use the time stones.

308
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:21,113
I got a little green one right here.

309
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:23,106
So I'm just gonna turn back time and now.

310
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:25,773
(clock ticking)

311
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:29,838
- Wait dude it totally is like the infinity gauntlet, bro.

312
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:30,671
- I think it worked!

313
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:31,504
- What? - Nothing.

314
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:32,337
Alright, you're all good?

315
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:33,170
- Yeah, totally good.

316
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,455
- Knuckles!

317
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,608
- Wait no, okay no that was not in the movie.

318
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:37,441
How did this one happen?

319
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:39,441
Maybe if I put the infinity gauntlet on my other hand

320
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,119
and do it to myself, let's him back.

321
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,074
Three, two, one.

322
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:43,618
Oh no, it didn't work, hold on!

323
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:44,451
Oh geez!

324
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:46,982
Okay we're good!

325
00:07:46,982 --> 00:07:49,004
Wait so from the beginning I could have just clapped and it

326
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:50,233
would have, never mind, welcome back!

327
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,460
- Alright I got my magnet.

328
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,357
Right there.

329
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:53,303
So I'm gonna lift it up here

330
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:55,968
- But it's dropping though.

331
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:56,801
- Dude, I'm not even.

332
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,022
Dude, look at that.

333
00:07:58,022 --> 00:07:59,599
Three, two, one.

334
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,701
Whoa!

335
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:02,686
The slime is like turning it off.

336
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:04,077
- [Collins] It's just like devouring it.

337
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:04,910
- [Deven] That looks so cool.

338
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,027
- That is so cool.

339
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,486
So you get to comment down below who won this round

340
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:09,899
at the end of it, one of us is going to be getting

341
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,597
slime dumped all over us--

342
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:12,430
- What?

343
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,892
- So right now, we are on to the next round.

344
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:15,738
Time to spin the wheel right now.

345
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:16,571
Here we go.

346
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:17,866
And spin!

347
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:18,861
- No countdown this time?

348
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:19,694
- No countdown.

349
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:20,813
I'm gonna try to count now.

350
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:22,479
Wait, how did it stop?!

351
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,779
It's like stuck in the middle.

352
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:24,612
I'm confused.

353
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:25,445
- Oh snap!

354
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:26,278
- Alright, I guess red it is.

355
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:27,111
Cornstarch.

356
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,800
I've never used cornstarch ever for slime.

357
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,967
- Interesting and I got.

358
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,167
No!

359
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,404
I got glitter.

360
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:33,237
- No!

361
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:34,070
- No!

362
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,903
- We are not using glitter.

363
00:08:34,903 --> 00:08:35,736
- Dude!

364
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:36,569
- It's not happening.

365
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:37,402
So I'm gonna put this in here.

366
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:39,367
This cornstarch I forgot from the Oobleck video.

367
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,879
This should be a good amount I guess.

368
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,037
- This glitter is gonna get everywhere.

369
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:43,642
- There is no chance that's it's going to be contained.

370
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:44,993
- No, I will be very precise!

371
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:45,826
Ooh no, okay.

372
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:46,659
- Uno.

373
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,908
- [Deven] Alright, alright we're good.

374
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:50,337
- And now it's time for our next ingredient.

375
00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:52,186
So let's spin the wheels.

376
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:53,019
Yay!

377
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:53,995
- [Deven] I got clear glue.

378
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:54,890
- [Collins] Alright, I got water.

379
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,153
- So, wait water?

380
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,352
- This is gonna turn into oobleck!

381
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:58,185
- Oh!

382
00:08:58,185 --> 00:08:59,192
(clapping hands)

383
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:00,533
- I love oobleck! - This is awesome!

384
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,366
- Oh my gosh!

385
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,199
Alright here we go.

386
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,100
Gonna add two cups of water because I added

387
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,623
one cup of corn starch.

388
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:06,456
So here we go.

389
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:08,265
Cup number one and this is cup number two.

390
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:09,740
Time to mix it up.

391
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,776
Let's get funky!

392
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:13,038
(yelling)

393
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:14,311
I forgot how weird this feels.

394
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,948
- Alright my strategy is gonna add a ton of this clear

395
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:20,528
glue so I don't have any glitter on my hand.

396
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:21,869
- Yes, it's turning into oobleck.

397
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:23,555
I forgot how cool this stuff is!

398
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:25,553
Guys, the thing about oobleck is that it's a liquid but

399
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:27,993
if you squeeze it, it becomes solid and then it melts

400
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:28,826
in your hand.

401
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:29,659
Like it's so cool!

402
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,996
- Or if you punch it, you just...

403
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:32,829
Look at that.

404
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:34,240
- Nothing come off. - Oh my goodness!

405
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,073
- Check this out,

406
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:36,388
if I put my hand in here and then I'm gonna try to pull

407
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,002
it up on the count of three and you'll see what happens.

408
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:38,980
The bucket will come with my hand.

409
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,973
You ready, one, two.

410
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:41,772
Three second like challenge.

411
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:44,658
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.

412
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:45,491
Here we go, you ready?

413
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:48,630
- [Both] Three, two, one, done.

414
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,003
- You ready, one, two, three.

415
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:51,210
- Whoa!

416
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,653
Alright mine is all mixed up.

417
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:54,127
Alright, there's yours, there's mine.

418
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,355
- What am I gonna land on?

419
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:56,188
- [Both] Red!

420
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,021
- What did I get?

421
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:59,093
- Oh I think you might have just messed it up.

422
00:09:59,093 --> 00:09:59,926
- No, what is it?

423
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:00,759
- [Deven] Food coloring.

424
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:01,592
- Yay!

425
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:02,683
Yes, its gonna work.

426
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:03,516
- I was just kidding!

427
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:04,375
I got red too dude.

428
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,208
- You got red as well?

429
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,284
- Yep, oh, contact solution.

430
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:07,117
Yes!

431
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:07,950
- Contact solution, okay.

432
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,847
- Dude, that's perfect actually.

433
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:10,961
Oh man, alright so here we go.

434
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:12,008
Oh man, how do you.

435
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:13,430
I broke my stick!

436
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,263
- Haha!

437
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:15,874
- This stuff is super duper strong.

438
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:17,940
Holy cow, well I guess I'm gonna need more sticks.

439
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,875
Oh there goes a stick.

440
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,126
I lost a stick in there.

441
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:20,959
Stick's gone.

442
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,209
Oh, hand cramp!

443
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:24,180
Here you have it.

444
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,622
This is muh finished 'bleck.

445
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:26,455
- Nice!

446
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:28,731
- Devan, yours definitely didn't work.

447
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:29,564
- No!

448
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:31,628
- I guess you guys get to comment down below who won this

449
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:34,186
round and right now we are on to the next slime.

450
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:35,051
Here we go!

451
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,258
And red!

452
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:38,756
- I better put a dig on yellow.

453
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,506
- [Both] Oh so close!

454
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:42,891
- I got plastic beads.

455
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:44,025
- And I got clear glue.

456
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:45,680
I call this one, walkin' the plank!

457
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,863
See you just put a little bit of clear glue on the plank.

458
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:49,796
- What, that seems incredibly inefficient.

459
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:51,442
- Yeah that was way cooler in my head.

460
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,219
It was gonna be like wooo and then it didn't do it

461
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,052
because it sucks.

462
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:54,885
That's loud.

463
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:55,718
- What?

464
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:57,621
That's a little more like it.

465
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:00,055
(grunting)

466
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,337
Having some troubles there?

467
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:04,157
- I got to take the top off of this thing.

468
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:05,701
- It's like you sneezed glue bro.

469
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:08,036
- Party time, alright clear glue.

470
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:10,381
Now we've got the clear glue.

471
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:12,013
Clear glue added in.

472
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:12,860
Are you taking some of it out?

473
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,311
- Yeah I think I used too much.

474
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:15,144
- Yeah probably the best.

475
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,543
Alright now guys, time to spin for the next ingredient.

476
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,376
Here we go.

477
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,086
- [Both] Three, two, one.

478
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:19,919
- You got blue.

479
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,793
- Hey, wait, which color.

480
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:21,768
Ah, different color blue.

481
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:22,864
I got clear glue.

482
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:23,718
- [Collins] And I got paint.

483
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:25,001
- Oh!

484
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:25,834
- That's a lot of paint.

485
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,563
Alright so I'm just gonna try to kind of gently mix it

486
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,477
together, you know?

487
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:29,310
- [Deven] Alright.

488
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,143
- Just enough to tint it.

489
00:11:30,143 --> 00:11:30,976
- [Deven] My glue is in.

490
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:33,028
- Alright let's spin for the next ingredient.

491
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:33,861
I'm calling it, blue.

492
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,067
Oh snap, I got it right!

493
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:36,900
- What?

494
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,733
- Alright let me see what I got.

495
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,566
Baking soda.

496
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:39,489
I got baking soda.

497
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:40,465
- And I got water.

498
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:41,298
Really?

499
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:43,567
- Alright I'm gonna add my baking soda.

500
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:44,412
Oh there we go.

501
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,371
- You know you could have just opened it beforehand

502
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,204
but it's okay.

503
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:48,037
- Got it, bloop.

504
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:49,852
Time to take another stick and mix it all together.

505
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:50,970
That looks pretty bad.

506
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,595
Kind of like slushy.

507
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:54,061
Alright let's spin again.

508
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,912
- Did you just hit your hand?

509
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:56,745
- Yeah I hurt--

510
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:57,578
- It sounded like that hurt.

511
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:58,948
- Red, let's see what I got.

512
00:11:58,948 --> 00:11:59,781
Contact solution.

513
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:00,777
- Oh, I got blue.

514
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,576
And I got, ooh, liquid starch.

515
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:03,827
Just what I needed, yes!

516
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:05,452
- [Collins] I'm gonna do like a teaspoon at a time

517
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:06,854
and see how well it's good.

518
00:12:06,854 --> 00:12:08,033
- This slime feels really weird.

519
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:10,535
It's actually kind of working out man.

520
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:11,368
- Is it really?

521
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:12,201
It doesn't look like it.

522
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:14,387
- This doesn't look like it's binding to you Collins?

523
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:15,237
'Cause it does to me.

524
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:16,070
- Look at this.

525
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,228
It's literally a shlime on a shtick!

526
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:21,515
- I'm gonna try to use this to catch my bucket.

527
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:22,348
You ready?

528
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:23,181
(buzzer)

529
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:24,014
(buzzer)

530
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:25,173
(bell dinging)

531
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,238
- How about this?

532
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:28,808
We both for the first time get to choose one ingredient

533
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:30,008
to add to finish it off.

534
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:31,309
So what do you want to pick Devan?

535
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:32,688
- Um, food coloring.

536
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:34,546
- Okay, and you know what my choice is gonna be

537
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,493
a little bit random.

538
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:36,976
I'm gonna pick some Cheetos.

539
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:37,809
- What?

540
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:40,357
- I think this would be perfect for Cheetos slime.

541
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:41,190
Hot and spicy.

542
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,400
Alright let's get the bag open.

543
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,233
(sniffing)

544
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:44,593
Alright so I think I'm gonna take a couple of them.

545
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:46,184
Kind of like break them up a little bit

546
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:47,017
and add 'em in like this.

547
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:47,850
It'll be kind of crunchy.

548
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,303
By the way, even though this may look delicious.

549
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:50,654
Don't eat it, not good.

550
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,210
You know I'm gonna take a handful and just kind of like..

551
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,043
(crunching)

552
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:55,317
Yo my hand is like all red from Cheetos.

553
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,150
Wait.

554
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,983

00:12:58,649 --> 00:12:59,482
- I've been caught.

558
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:00,315
- Don't do it.

559
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:01,148
- Red-handed.

560
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:01,981
- Oh he did it.

561
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:02,969
Really bro?

562
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:03,814
(sneezing)

563
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:06,585
- I'm gonna add more Cheetos to it 'cause yeah!

564
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,932
- [Deven] You got way too excited about that.

565
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:08,765
Geez.

566
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:09,598
- That's a lot of Cheetos!

567
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:10,523
- Wow.

568
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,027
- Yeah, this is super crunchy.

569
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:14,091
- It smells like a flaming hot Cheeto in here bro.

570
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:15,886
- It legit flaming hot!

571
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:16,719

572
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,469
- This looks so cool!

573
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:22,686
- I got a chip of hot Cheetos under my nail!

574
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:23,519
- Oh no!

575
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,524
(yelling)

576
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:28,220
- So you guys get to comment down below who this round and

Let's go.

579
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:32,852
Taking off and getting our first ingredient.

580
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:33,685
Here we go.

581
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:34,518
Three, two, one.

582
00:13:34,518 --> 00:13:35,425
Oh I got green.

583
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,497
Alright let's see what I got.

584
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:38,859
- I got green as well.

585
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,692
Clear glue.

586
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:40,525
- Clay.

587
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:43,264
Alright, I forgot how cool this stuff feels.

588
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,014
Don't touch my clay.

589
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:46,202
- Oh, I kinda broke it.

590
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:47,553
- It's just like a cloud.

591
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:48,386
Oh my gosh.

592
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:49,585
Next spin, next ingredient.

593
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:50,418
Let's go!

594
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,343
Alright, let's see what I got here.

595
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:54,176
I got lotion.

596
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:55,009
- Lotion?

597
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:55,842
- Lotion.

598
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:56,675
- Huh.

599
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:57,512
Oh yeah I got contact solution by the way.

600
00:13:57,512 --> 00:13:59,100
- I guess I'm just gonna stick it in like this

601
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,431
and then just in like the middle of it.

602
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:01,264
- How's it goin' over there?

603
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:02,097
- Oh, not good.

604
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:02,930
- It looks really gross.

605
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,547
- This is disgus...

606
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:07,706
It's all slimy, slippery, and lotiony.

607
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,027
- [Deven] It was so much fun before.

608
00:14:09,027 --> 00:14:09,860
- Holy cow.

609
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,366
It's like it, it's ruining my clay.

610
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:13,497
If I get another bad ingredient.

611
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:14,492
It's just done.

612
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:16,553
So I'm just gonna find some white glue and add it in.

613
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:17,386
- Okay?

614
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:18,465
- Eww!

615
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:20,932
Man lotion makes it really hard to open things.

616
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:22,681
Devan, can you open that for me?

617
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:23,636
Pour it right in that little pocket.

618
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:24,469
Uh oh, uh oh.

619
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:26,535
Not good, not good, not good at all.

620
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:27,939
Tryin' to mix it all together.

621
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:28,772
Power time!

622
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:30,072
Alright, whoa, just got,

623
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:31,051
oh no, lost a giant chunk of it.

624
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:31,884
Glue me up.

625
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:33,133
In the middle, yep, a lot more.

626
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:33,966
- A lot more?

627
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:34,799
- Yeah more.

628
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:35,632
Oh, that's too much, too much.

629
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:37,629
Oh boy, well this may have just.

630
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:39,530
Oh, oh this feels nice!

631
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,637
Now the lotion, the glue, and the clay together.

632
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:44,018
You have a rather interesting texture.

633
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,070
It's time to spin the wheel again but Devan I got stuff

634
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,903
all over my hands.

635
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:47,736
- I gotchu.

636
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:48,569
Three, two, one.

637
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:49,697
- Thank you. - Thank you.

638
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:51,608
- [Deven] Alright you got baby oil bro.

639
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:52,441
- Baby oil?

640
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:53,274
- Yep. - What?

641
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:54,344
- [Deven] And I got food coloring.

642
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:56,215
- Just gotta add some baby oil and I don't know how much

643
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:57,048
of this I add.

644
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:58,979
Not shocking at all but it smells like a baby!

645
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,979
Whoa that looks so cool.

646
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:03,825
- [Deven] Food coloring just makes everything look

647
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:05,140
way more awesome man.

648
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,615
- And baby oil just makes it a lot more, I dunno, soft?

649
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:09,569
- Your wheel, my wheel.

650
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:10,402
You got yellow.

651
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:11,822
Ooh you have contact solution.

652
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:12,655
- Finally!

653
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:13,488
- [Deven] Sponges?

654
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:14,448
- You got sponges? - What?

655
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:18,103
- Alright well let's see how these sponges work.

656
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:18,936
- Well I got it open!

657
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:19,769
Got a lot in here man.

658
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:20,695
- [Deven] This is weird.

659
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:22,221
I don't know what's going on with this.

660
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,297
- [Collins] That looks so awesome!

661
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,248
How have we've never done that before?

662
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:26,791
- It's making some weird noises man.

663
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,458
Listen, just listen.

664
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,853
Dude, it sounds like it's alive.

665
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:34,770
- Holy cow!

666
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:38,496
- [Deven] This is getting weirder and weirder bro.

667
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,670
- Yeah it's not happy you keep mixing it.

668
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,776
It's like, stop it!

669
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:42,609
You gonna add all of them?

670
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,442
- [Deven] Yeah, it's the best part.

671
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,275
- That's awesome dude.

672
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,643
Well I think this is about as good as mine's gonna get.

673
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:51,286
- Mine looks interesting.

674
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:53,817

Right now, we are outside and it's time for the slime dumps.

678
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,434
We've got the pool of shame.

679
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:03,846
The loser of this challenge is--

680
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,647
- That guy. - Devan, nope, it's you.

681
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:06,480
- What?

682
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,313

- Dip it in here.

688
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,203
- I still can't believe you're making me do this.

689
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:19,925
- Oh I forgot how slimy this stuff is.

690
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:20,758
Alright.

691
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:21,591

Oh my gosh!
