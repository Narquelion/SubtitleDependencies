1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,771
- My parents will be so upset when they find out about this.

2
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:02,604
- [Together] No!

3
00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:03,437
(tone) - What's up?

4
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:06,788
It's Collins Key and today we are doing another DIY.

5
00:00:06,788 --> 00:00:09,600
And today, get ready for this, we are doing

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,003
a giant glow in the dark glitter slime stress ball,

7
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,766
that's made out of a giant Wubble.

8
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,194
No, it hit my brother's painting!

9
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:17,866
I am going to literally die.

10
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:20,606
This painting is absolutely gorgeous

11
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:23,799
and the Wubble may or may not have just hit it in the face.

12
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:25,728
I've had bad experiences with Wubbles

13
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:27,958
and this is just one more of those bad experiences.

14
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,047
Like when I did the testing As Seen On TV Products video,

15
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:32,288
well yeah you guys, you know what happened there.

16
00:00:32,288 --> 00:00:33,451
(whooshing) - Ahhh!

17
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,589
Uhhh! (laughing)

18
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:35,422
- [Man] Direct hit.

19
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:36,881
(Wubble popping) - Ohhh!

20
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:37,881
- [Man] K-O.

21
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:40,120
- [Collins] My God dude that hurt.

22
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,745
- [Man] Look at what's on his face.

23
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:42,604
- What?

24
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:43,437
- [Man] Look at that.

25
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:44,421
- What happpened?

26
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:45,463
- Wait, what happened?

27
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:46,296
- [Man] Look at that.

28
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,302
- What happened?

29
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:48,135
- [Man] Oh man.

30
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:48,968
- What happened?

31
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:49,905
- That didn't hurt? - Wow!

32
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:50,738
- That hurt a lot!

33
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:52,482
Today I'm going to be attempting to conquer

34
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:54,627
my fear of the Wubble by turning it into

35
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:56,934
a giant DIY stress ball.

36
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:59,207
And if you want me to do a super messy slime challenge,

37
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:00,960
let me know by liking this video.

38
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,097
And if this video gets enough thumbs up,

39
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:04,837
then I will do a crazy challenge, probably with Devan,

40
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:06,788
where we just dump a whole bunch of slime

41
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:07,621
all over each other.

42
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:08,918
So yeah thumbs up this video right now

43
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:09,751
if you want to see that.

44
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,356
Now there are two parts to this DIY.

45
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:14,131
Part number one is where I'm actually going to make the DIY,

46
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,255
and part number two I'm going to slice it open

47
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,496
and pour all the slime all over myself.

48
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,656
If you want to see that, I posted it on my Instagram

49
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:22,815
so go check out the link down in the description below.

50
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,995
That will take you directly to that Instagram post

51
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:27,363
and if you like the post, comment Fluffy Bunny

52
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:28,826
and then follow me on Instagram,

like turn on my post notification.

54
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,264
I'll be going through your guys' photos,

55
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:32,097
liking a ton of them.

56
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:34,163
And also I'm going to be following some of you guys

57
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:35,739
on Instagram who do that.

58
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:36,970
So go check that out right now.

59
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,987
And I'm super excited because I'm doing a free meetup

60
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:41,193
this Saturday in LA at 6:00 p.m.

61
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:42,366
on the 3rd Street Promenade.

62
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:43,712
Basically I just want to hang out with you guys,

63
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:46,034
give you some free stuff and also do some crazy magic.

64
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:48,693
And this is all because I'm teaming up with AT&T Hello Lab,

65
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,446
and we're going to be filming this meetup as well.

66
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:51,279
So if you guys are there,

67
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,347
you're going to be a part of this video.

68
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:53,438
It's going to be crazy.

69
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:55,528
All the information is down in the description below.

70
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:57,084
I got to give credit to Corina Garcia

71
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,454
who inspired me to make this video.

72
00:01:58,454 --> 00:02:00,416
So go check out her videos, I'm going to put them down

73
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,249
in the description below.

74
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:03,829
So without any further ado, let's jump right into the video.

75
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,695
All you need for this DIY are just four things.

76
00:02:05,695 --> 00:02:07,692
Number one is the Wubble.

77
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:09,562
(rising reveal music)

78
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,395
Yike!

79
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:13,818
Heeh!

80
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:14,951
You also need some measuring cups,

81
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:16,135
you're going to need some glue,

82
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,718
some liquid starch.

83
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,833
Don't you ever disrespect me again.

84
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,745
And last but not least, I like this glue more.

85
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,614
We're going to kick this off by making the slime first.

86
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,459
And all you're going to be doing for this

87
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,280
is adding equal parts glue and equal parts water,

88
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,662
mixing them all together.

89
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:36,888
Whu hu ho, this is going to be so so cool.

90
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:38,931
If I didn't know better I would say this looks like yogurt

91
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:40,196
and I would try to eat it right now

92
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:44,196
because I haven't eaten yet today, it looks real

93
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:49,965
(gagging)

94
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:54,200
Tsk tsk tsk, does not, (gagging)

95
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,617
it does not tastes like yogurt at all.

96
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:57,614
We're just going to forget that that ever happened.

97
00:02:57,614 --> 00:02:58,961
And no screenshots please guys.

98
00:02:58,961 --> 00:02:59,901
(dings)

99
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:01,152
You guys I'm a genius because instead of

100
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:02,437
using one cup each time,

101
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:03,993
which was kind of slowing down the entire process,

102
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:06,234
I could dump this entire thing in there all at once

103
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:07,906
and then all I have to do is just fill it up with water

104
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:09,496
because that will make sure it's equal parts water,

105
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:11,095
and equal parts glue, I'm a genius.

106
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:12,186
Here we go.

107
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:14,845
Yo ho ho, this is a lot of glue.

108
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,362
If you are a slime critic watching this,

109
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,360
you probably going to say at the moment

110
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,357
things are looking a little bit too bland

111
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:20,399
and I completely agree with you.

112
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,359
So right now we're going to spice up.

113
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,716
We got some blue, we got some pink, some red,

114
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:25,458
we're going to add some color into this

115
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,002
and just kind of see how it looks.

116
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,303
Alright here we go guys, we got two colors at once.

117
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:31,576
Let's see if I could actually like swirl them mid air.

118
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:35,987
(liquid squirting) (laughing)

119
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:37,659
I can't, guys I'm sorry.

120
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,377
(mumbles) (mimics sneezing)

121
00:03:39,377 --> 00:03:40,287
(laughing) It didn't work.

122
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,457
I have like one here, I have a whole bunch of these like

123
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:44,196
glitter tubes which we are going to be using.

124
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:45,334
Here we go, you guys ready for this?

125
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:48,724
This is about to look amazing, here we go.

126
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:51,080
These are literally just like tubes with glitter in them,

127
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,752
like that's really all this is right now.

128
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:53,902
One more thing of pink.

129
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:58,261
(liquid squirting) (laughing)

130
00:03:58,261 --> 00:03:59,291
If you were to look up how to do this

131
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,227
normally they would suggest you use a spoon to mix it up

132
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:03,142
but personally I'm extra fancy man,

133
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,302
I know how to use chopsticks and so I'm going to be

134
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:07,624
using chopsticks to mix this whole thing up.

135
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:08,457
So let's see here.

136
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,626
Okay like I was completely joking, like I didn't know

137
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:10,587
this would actually be good.

138
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:12,839
This actually looks super cool with the chopsticks.

139
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,883
Here's the thing about DIY, you never know exactly

140
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:16,052
how it's going to go and at the moment

141
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:17,399
this is just not colorful enough.

142
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,699
So we've got some food coloring here

143
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:22,240
so hopefully this will really make a huge difference,

144
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,587
'cause if not this not going to be

145
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:24,907
a colorful slime at all.

146
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:27,206
So adding the green food, that was literally the best thing

147
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:28,236
I could have ever done because now

148
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:29,862
it actually looks like slime.

149
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,393
And now I just need to add a whole bunch of water.

150
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:33,612
So without splashing this everywhere,

151
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:36,096
we're just gonna kinda go for it, let's see.

152
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:39,231
(liquid pouring)

153
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:41,228
Contain yourself water. (gasps)

154
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,061
It's getting out of hand.

155
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:42,905
It's getting a little bit out of hand.

156
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:45,201
And I was like no, no, stop it, stop it!

157
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,706
No, no, no, stop!

158
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:49,002
Alright there we go, it is starting to look

159
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,452
real funky now man, real funky.

160
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:52,833
We're getting a spoon upgrade right now

161
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,597
because now I need to mix this stuff all together so.

162
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:58,290
Yeah so like it's not really mixing together that well.

163
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,287
This table means a lot to my parents

164
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,085
and so I cannot get it like messed up at all.

165
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:05,128
So that's why I'm just trying to be super cautious right now

166
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:07,079
because I will lose my DIY privileges.

167
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,970
Next we are adding the liquid starch into this container,

168
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,630
so let's go for it.

169
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,139
(liquid pouring) (chuckling)

170
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,471
This stuff looks weird.

171
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,468
So next I'm going to be adding a whole bunch of the water

172
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:19,928
and glue into this and hopefully it'll turn into slime.

173
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:22,749
We're going to be using this bowl here to scoop

174
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:25,652
the glue water and them dump it,

175
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:28,069
oh ho ho ho, that's so heavy.

176
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,584
Yeah this getting real slimy now.

177
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,291
You know what, using a spoon is not that much fun

178
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:37,564
so we're gonna go with my hands right now, let's just.

179
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:39,607
Yuh awww. (chuckles)

180
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,904
This feels so good, oh my gosh yo.

181
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:44,692
(slime dripping and splatting)

182
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:46,689
(laughing)

183
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:49,189
Look at this! This is so wild!

184
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:52,302
(slime squashing)

185
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:53,135
(laughing)

186
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:54,502
This next part, I feel rather innovative.

187
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:56,708
What I've done is I've actually taken the glue container,

188
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,577
chopped off the top of it and we are now

189
00:05:58,577 --> 00:05:59,877
going to use that as a funnel.

190
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:01,955
I'm using my brother, so here are Devan's hands,

191
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:03,012
his lovely model hands.

192
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:05,757
So now we're going to take this, (chuckles) it's so heavy.

193
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:09,705
Basically just go take it, (chuckles) it's so heavy.

194
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,980
The goal is, take this and dump it into here,

195
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,206
and I will funnel it into the Wubble.

196
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:16,691
Here we go, ohh yup.

197
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:17,774
Casual, okay.

198
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:19,628
You ready Devan?

199
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:20,461
- [Devan] I'm waiting.

200
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:21,294
- [Collins] Dude hold it.

201
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:23,459
- [Devan] I am, I am, I am.

202
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,852
Oh my gosh.

203
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,285
(Collins gasping)

204
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,165
It's on my hands.

205
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:28,645
Dude it's on my hands. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

206
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:29,521
I'm sorry, I'm fine, I'm. - You just need

207
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:30,716
one of these to stabilize.

208
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:33,398
- Alright so we are like in crisis mode right now

209
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:34,744
because we need to figure out,

210
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:35,836
I'm going to, we need more water

211
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:39,169
I think is what the issue is, excuse me.

212
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:42,107
- Nah nah nah nah nah nah no, it's not attached.

213
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,276
- We're going with a different plan here,

214
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,919
it's called the Shove Slime Method.

215
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:45,752
This isn't going to work.

216
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:47,017
- I'm going to break it. (giggles)

217
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:48,729
- Ow! (panting) Help!

218
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,502
This does not smart, this does not smart.

219
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:51,707
Oh no we're breaking the Wubble!

220
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:53,506
I think I literally just snapped the Wubble.

221
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:56,144
This is hands down the greatest fail I've ever had

222
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:59,488
at a (laughs) DIY ever, ever.

223
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:02,355
Uhh (slaps) uhh (slaps)

224
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,188
♫ DIY

225
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:04,142
Oh this is going to be so perfect,

226
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:04,975
this is going to be amazing.

227
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:05,985
This is going to totally work.

228
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:08,713
Yes, I might've actually added too much water, shoot!

229
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:10,466
Guys we got one more friend to help us out,

230
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:11,523
his name is Mason.

231
00:07:11,523 --> 00:07:12,449
- What's up Mason?

232
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:13,804
- I'm gonna like bring up a lot like this

233
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:15,107
and you gotta like cut it off at the bottom

234
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:16,244
and like put it in there.

235
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:17,158
Alright so I'm going to lift up like this,

236
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,684
cut off at the bottom, and then, and then dump it

237
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:20,539
in there, dump it in, dump it in there, okay!

238
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:21,962
- [Mason] Oh that was nice!

239
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:23,619
- No, Mason's good at this!

240
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:24,757
Let's do it again, okay here we go.

241
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:25,590
Ooop, cut it off, cut it off.

242
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,604
Yeah, ninja chop it, ninja chop it, ninja chop it.

243
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:28,869
Back in, there we go.

244
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:29,976
- Nice. - Alright here we go,

245
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:32,400
whoever's new, this will be a four person thing.

246
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,067
Go go go, shove it in. - Ohhhhhh!

247
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,718
- Get it off the side. - I can't, I can't.

248
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:40,065
I can't, no! - Ahhhh!

249
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:40,958
- No, no!

250
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:41,852
- [Together] No!

251
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,815
- No! - It's got to stay in.

252
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:45,823
- This was the terriblist idea we've ever had.

253
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:47,239
Alright guys definitely not a brilliant idea

254
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:50,455
and Devan's idea was to use the funnel as a giant scoop.

255
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:52,011
And so like we scoop all the liquid in here.

256
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:53,439
Mason you want to cut it off over there.

257
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,272
- Yeah. - And here we go,

258
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:55,212
three, two, one, go for it.

259
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:56,141
And then see if we can get,

260
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:58,707
ayyyy, we are geniuses!

261
00:07:58,707 --> 00:07:59,540
- Oh, wow.

262
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,707
- Yes! Ah yes!

263
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,424
Oh we're so smart, well Devan's smart.

264
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:06,781
Alright this might have to be our last scoop bro.

265
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:08,290
Here we go, go, go, go.

266
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,265
My parents are going to be so upset

267
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:11,634
when they find out about this table, like so upset.

268
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:13,612
- You just want to dump this now?

269
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:14,445
- [Collins] Yeah, let's just give it a shot,

270
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:15,278
let's go for it.

271
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:16,764
- Yeah okay alright, nice.

272
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,099
- [Collins] Yeah Mason!

273
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,182
- Oh my gosh.

274
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:20,975
- [Collins] There we go, that's good,

275
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:21,808
that's good, that's good.

276
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:22,641
- [Devan] Alright you got it.

277
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,474
- Alright well there we go.

278
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:25,515
Now we have the giant DIY stress ball.

279
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:26,978
How's it going to stay closed now?

280
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:28,452
Alright guys well there you have it,

281
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:30,666
this is the giant DIY--

282
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,419
- Uh, you got it on me. - I'm sorry bro.

283
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,252
This is the um (slaps)

284
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:34,085
the stress ball so. - No!

285
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:35,423
- This failed so bad. (chuckles)

286
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:37,629
This is the worst fail I ever had as a DIY.

287
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:39,797
