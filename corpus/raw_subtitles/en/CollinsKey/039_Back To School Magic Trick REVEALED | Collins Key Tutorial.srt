1
00:00:00,216 --> 00:00:01,414
- What's up, it's Collins Key

2
00:00:01,414 --> 00:00:02,784
and for today's video I am going to

3
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:03,761
break the magician's code.

4
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:05,661
And I'm going to teach you a super easy magic trick

5
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:07,118
that you can do for all of your friends

6
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:08,059
when you go back to school.

7
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:09,627
And basically, you're gonna make your friends think

8
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:12,112
you literally learned to become a wizard over summer break.

9
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,867
Now, for this, I need a Muggle to join me.

10
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:17,092
My non-magical little brother, Devon Key.

11
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:18,486
- Hey, what's up.

12
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:19,753
- That was quite an entrance there.

13
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:20,876
- Yeah, I was ready for school, you know.

14
00:00:20,876 --> 00:00:21,762
(laughs)

15
00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:22,796
- Is that what you think?

16
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:24,161
That people go back to school like that?

17
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:25,030
- Yeah, just like that.

18
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,624
- I don't think that's how people go back to school, Devon.

19
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,273
But for this magic trick, all you're going to need

20
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:30,292
is just paper.

21
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:34,891
- And by the way, this is not my backpack, so, yeet.

22
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:35,996
I didn't like that backpack.

23
00:00:35,996 --> 00:00:36,994
- I guess not.

24
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:39,258
So this right here is step number one and this is the

25
00:00:39,258 --> 00:00:41,453
super secret setup for the magic.

26
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:42,838
So you do not do this in front of people.

27
00:00:42,838 --> 00:00:43,984
This is the private setup.

28
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:46,463
You take off one piece of paper.

29
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,427
Here we go, put this over here.

30
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:49,390
And now you're going to crumple it up

31
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,946
into a little ball.

32
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:52,338
And this right here

33
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:54,513
is about to become palmy.

34
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,937
Take the paper like this,

35
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:58,437
put it in your fingers, boom.

36
00:00:58,437 --> 00:00:59,525
That's called palming.

37
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:01,188
And if you hold it like this from the front

38
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:03,264
they can't tell that anything is in your hand.

39
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:04,574
That's like little crab hands.

40
00:01:04,574 --> 00:01:05,663
- Yeah, little pincers.

41
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:06,757
(laughs)

42
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:09,928
- But secretly, you have this piece palmed in your hand.

43
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:10,822
And that's how you start off.

44
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:12,821
Don't let anyone know that this piece is in your hand.

45
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:14,261
So here's how you start the trick.

46
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:16,263
Come out with your pad of paper.

47
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:19,432
Remove one of the pieces of paper.

48
00:01:19,432 --> 00:01:23,021
Perfect, we don't need this anymore so, yeet!

49
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:25,310
(laughs)

50
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,155
I've never yeeted anything that hard in my entire life, so.

51
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,521
(laughs)

52
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:31,832
Okay, so what you're gonna do is

53
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:33,029
you're gonna take a piece of paper.

54
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:33,862
- Yeah.

55
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:34,747
- And you're gonna tear it like this.

56
00:01:34,747 --> 00:01:35,840
- Okay.

57
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,096
- And then tear it again, just tear it

58
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,311
as many times as you want.

59
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,919
And this is what you do in front of your friends.

60
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:41,069
And they're all gonna think you're literally

61
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,211
just tearing up a piece of paper.

62
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:43,813
Now, you're going to take all the pieces.

63
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:44,966
- I'm doing bad at this, alright.

64
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,022
- And then you're gonna crumple them all up

65
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,463
into a little ball.

66
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:49,447
The more crumpling you do, the better, yeah.

67
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:50,549
You gotta crumple them up just like that.

68
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:51,382
- Yeah, okay.

69
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:52,215
- Alright, here we go.

70
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,260
And you have two pieces here.

71
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,769
Put them into both hands like this.

72
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:57,366
Come on in close for me, come on in close.

73
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,199
So here's what's going to happen,

74
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,293
this is what's on right now.

75
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,726
You have torn up pieces right here

76
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:03,800
secretly hidden in your hand, boom.

77
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,958
Full piece of paper that no one knows about.

78
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,407
So this right here is what you're gonna do

79
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,672
is you're gonna move the pieces around like this, bam.

80
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,625
It's going to take a little bit of practice,

81
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,750
so now you have the torn up pieces right here,

82
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,329
full piece of paper here.

83
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:18,097
Audience has no idea what's going on.

84
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,153
Your friends, they're totally clueless to this.

85
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,190
So for the next part you're gonna actually

86
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,270
take out a magic wand.

87
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,103
I have a magic marker.

88
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:26,647
(laughs)

89
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,473
Take the magic marker, wave it over the pieces like this.

90
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:31,322
And then you don't need it anymore so yeet!

91
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:32,155
And then...

92
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:33,595
(laughs)

93
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:36,401
And then now do whatever your magic gesture is.

94
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:39,005
Take those torn up pieces that they think are all torn up.

95
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:41,468
You open up those pieces and now

96
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:44,043
it is fused into a full piece of paper.

97
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:45,376
- [Both] No way.

98
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:49,133
- You can now hand this piece of paper out for examination.

99
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,381
I don't know what that was.

100
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:51,885
And you are good to go.

101
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:54,991
Only issue you have is if they ask to see your hand.

102
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:55,958
- Yeah.

103
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:56,962
- Cause if you unwrap your hand they're

104
00:02:56,962 --> 00:03:00,024
going to see you have a whole bunch of torn up pieces.

105
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:00,857
Unless you're a magician.

106
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:03,266
If you're a magician, you just kind of, like this.

107
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,436
And then check this out.

108
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,269
Take all those pieces.

109
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:09,829
Open them up.

110
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:13,076
- [Both] No way.

111
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,601
- So this video blew your mind,
