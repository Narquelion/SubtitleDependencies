1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,750
- We're known for making crazy life hacks,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,647
and you're always asking us,

3
00:00:02,647 --> 00:00:04,320
"Do they really work in real life?"

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,730
So today, we built The 'ULTIMATE ORBEEZ OBSTACLE COURSE'

5
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,490
to test these life hacks under the most extreme conditions.

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,410
Like this one for example,

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,770
A watermelon stuffed full with a whole bunch of matches.

8
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,310
- Yeah, I don't get how this is a life hack.

9
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,760
- Just wait until you see how it's actually used

10
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,593
in the obstacle course.

11
00:00:16,593 --> 00:00:18,750
It's gonna blow your mind, it'll make perfect sense.

12
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,200
The first obstacle we're gonna be tackling

13
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,670
and creating life hacks for is the balance race.

14
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,760
Where if we fall off,

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
we'll be landing on a painful bed of Legos,

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,650
or into a massive vat of slime.

17
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,250
So right now, let's go make the life hacks,

18
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,440
that'll make sure we don't fall off as we race across.

19
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,540
I'm making a balancing pole

20
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,150
with squishy pineapples on either end.

21
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,820
So right now, here's a crazy life hack

22
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,020
to make some homemade squishies.

23
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,389
Here we go three, two, one.

24
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:40,522
Whoa! (both squealing)

25
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:42,350
- You broke it, bro! - I broke it, bro!

26
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,369
- Wow! - Holy cow, I broke it!

27
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:46,020
- So, as you're making your nonsense over there,

28
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,900
I am gonna make my balancing apparatus.

29
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,370
- Nonsense? - Well, yes, seriously.

30
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,463
- Bro, squishies are where it's at, man.

31
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:52,390
How's that gonna help you balance?

32
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,480
You're gonna look like a giant, like, floating rag.

33
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,850
- I'm making some wings.

34
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,707
- All right, well, I'm dumping the water in there.

35
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:57,940
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! (splash)

36
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,747
- See, you get a little extra of soap sud in there,

37
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:01,710
you gotta dual wield these (laughs)

38
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,830
I can't say the name of these

39
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,770
cause we will get in trouble.

40
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,630
- Why will we get in trouble?

41
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,463
- Don't ask.

42
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:06,296
All right, so here we go. - Oh yes, oh yes.

43
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:07,129
I got you.

44
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:08,010
- Okay, so here's the deal, we're gonna to put

45
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,080
all this in and this it's gonna help

46
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,180
to create the pineapple.

47
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,147
I guess it's like a life hack as well,

48
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:13,090
except my hands are getting very tired.

49
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,120
- All right, one wing is done.

50
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,518
Now it's time to make the frame for it.

51
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:17,460
So, I'm going to start with this long PVC pipe

52
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,810
here and then bend it around the boogie board.

53
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,860
- Gotta get the silicone and get all nice, here we go.

54
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,757
Soapy water! (splash)

55
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:23,730
(laughs)

56
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,850
Yeah, that's unfortunate.

57
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,737
Oh my goodness this is in my eye.

58
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,640
Holy cow, this side of my face looks shut down.

59
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,670
I can't hear anything and I can't see anything.

60
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,930
- Useless life hack alert!

61
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,240
I have some hot sand here if you ever wanna bend a PVC pipe,

62
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,073
pour some hot sand down it.

63
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:40,010
- While you do that, time for me to coat my pineapple

64
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,150
in the silicone over here.

65
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,400
NFL, if you're watching this you might consider drafting me.

66
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,249
42, set, pineapple

67
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:46,921
(crash) Oh, geez, oh.

68
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:47,754
Dude (laughs)

69
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,080
- Well that wasn't coat it.

70
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,784
- It's giving me beach vibes right now.

71
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:51,617
- Exactly - There's sand and water.

72
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:52,500
(upbeat music)

73
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,830
I bet you we could go ice skating on this stuff.

74
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,260
- Wow - Key Olympics

75
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,778
- Ta-da! - Figure skate

76
00:01:57,778 --> 00:01:58,611
(crash)

77
00:01:58,611 --> 00:01:59,444
(gong) (bang)

78
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:00,277
- Whoa - Karate kicks

79
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:01,110
- Geez

80
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,440
- Now unfortunately making a squishy pineapple

81
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,010
has distracted from your life hacks.

82
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,410
The question is, does this useless life hack

83
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,400
actually bend the pole?

84
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,233
- Absolutely not at all.

85
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,546
- Let me try, let me try. - Look, look, look.

86
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:09,970
Oh what are you - What are you, what are you?

87
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,540
Oh! That's hot sand. That is hot sand.

88
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,480
- It just broke off.

89
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,700
- All right, so we got a pineapple,

90
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,020
we got a silicone, you know what's 'bout to happen.

91
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,270
- No. No. (bang)

92
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,906
Oh (laughs) I see that now.

93
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,310
- (growls) - Whoa, it's working!

94
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,490
- Bend down for one second.

95
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,350
- Yes! Look at that, man. That is my wing structure.

96
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,183
- I was aiming for the Legos.

97
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:29,900
- That went really far. - Whoops.

98
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,981
- NFL, give him a call

99
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:31,910
(laughter)

100
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,120
- So, if you're wondering how this relates

101
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,660
to making a squishy, basically this will create

102
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,690
the mold that'll fill with the squishy material

103
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,560
and that's going to help me cross a tight rope race.

104
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
Whoa, ho, ho. Glad I found that.

105
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,840
- I honestly can't believe that this worked.

106
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,673
- Wait - This is insane.

107
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:43,520
- And this is for your wing?

108
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,550
- This is for my wing, so it's going to be like that.

109
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,864
- I still can't believe Devan about to look like a bird.

110
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:49,070
(laughter) - No. Like a dragon, bro.

111
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,163
- No. You're going to look - No.

112
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:51,180
- Like a sparrow.

113
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,704
- Sparrows are pretty cool too. I'll take it.

114
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:53,570
- You look like a pigeon.

115
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,060
- Okay, I don't take that. We have a useless

116
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,380
life hack that actually works.

117
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,230
- So congratulations, you found the first one

118
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,780
coz' I don't know if this silicone one

119
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,140
is quite working man. You could have just like

120
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,732
bought a pineapple mold. All right.

121
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:03,571
So, I've got to go let this thing dry.

122
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:04,733
(screams) Oh my god!

123
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,233
It went under my nail. Fudge! That was not fun.

124
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:08,977
All right. Sick, so let's, let's go let this

125
00:03:08,977 --> 00:03:11,220
thing dry now and tend to my nail.

126
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,420
All right, so I've got the mold,

127
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,660
I've taken the pineapple out and now

128
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,370
it's time to create the squishy on the inside.

129
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,203
All right, here we go. Time to poor it in.

130
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:19,833
Here we go. Three, two, one. Let's go for it.

131
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,380
(screams)

132
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,307
- Man - No!

133
00:03:22,307 --> 00:03:23,560
- Holy cow, okay.

134
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,960
- So, this is foam, not elephant toothpaste?

135
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,055
- This is foam right here, so we're going

136
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:28,797
to have to like clear off the top, let it set.

137
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:30,090
- And I just have to attach a couple more

138
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,020
of these PVC pipes and then the frame will be done.

139
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,240
- Oh and we have partnered with Adobe

140
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,160
to bring you a massive giveaway so stick around

141
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,167
to find out how you can enter in for a chance to win.

142
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:40,490
The DIYs are done and bro, those wings are insane.

143
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,960
- Yeah, they might be a bit overkill.

144
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,500
- Yeah, for this race, whoever makes it backwards

145
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,687
across the balance beams all the way first wins

146
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,560
and if we fall off we're going to be landing

147
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,360
on a painful bed of legos or in a massive pool of slime

148
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,670
and you know to make it even more fun

149
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,890
we've actually brought along our friends

150
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,210
who've got water balloons, squirt guns

151
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,043
and a whole bunch

152
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:55,876
of other stuff. - [Devan] Exactly.

153
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:57,170
- They will be throwing at us to try to knock us off

154
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,790
as we go across these balance beams.

155
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,900
All right, Devan. You ready? - I'm ready.

156
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,733
- All right, here we go.

157
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:01,566
- [Devan and Collins] 3, 2 - Oh wait.

158
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,880
- Five second subscribe challenge.

159
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,580
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

160
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,430
and turn on the channel post notifications

161
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,617
in five seconds, you ready? Here we go.

162
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:13,360
- [Devan and Collins] 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Done.

163
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,620
- If you were able to do that, comment down below,

164
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,520
Key Bros squad, right now and let's go for it.

165
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,220
- [Devan and Collins] 3, 2, 1, Go!.

166
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,520
- Whoa

167
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,464
(screaming) (confetti pops)

168
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:21,366
- Here we go, all right, you got your balance?

169
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,640
(screams)

170
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,658
- You're shaking me. We shouldn't have connected these.

171
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:28,340
(screams)

172
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,621
- Ugh, my back is terrible. How is you working, dude?

173
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,454
- These wings are actually kind of working.

174
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:35,571
- Pineapples for the lose. Are you like already making it?

175
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:36,404
(laughter)

176
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:38,885
Oh no. - No

177
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:39,749
- Are you in the slime? I have a chance.

178
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:42,749
I have a chance. I'm getting soaked.

179
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,340
(screams) Oh that was not fun.

180
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,857
All right so I fell off and now I've got to get back up.

181
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:50,980
- Oh, the slime is all over my feet.

182
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,324
- Is it slippery? - Yes.

183
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,157
- Your wing is hitting me.

184
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:53,990
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

185
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,035
- Take the wing out - No. Sorry.

186
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:57,007
- I fell off again. This pineapple sucks.

187
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:00,090
This life hack is a bust. Here we go. 3, 2, 1, Yeet.

188
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,040
- I just want to make it to the Orbeez Pool.

189
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,016
That's all I want

190
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:06,000
(screaming)

191
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,630
- Why are you on my side? - I don't know. I think

192
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,410
- Oh my kidney. (chuckle) - Dude.

193
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,150
- How have you not fallen in the Legos yet?

194
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,940
Oh my other kidney. Do I have two kidneys?

195
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,040
Yeah, they both hurt.

196
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,700
- Extend the wings. - Oh yeah, balancing.

197
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,533
- I got it.

198
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,419
- I've got good vibe about this one man.

199
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:22,300
(screaming)

200
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,545
No. No. Oh no. - Yes!

201
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:24,483
- I can still make it though. I'm just going

202
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:27,843
to have to cross the Legos, (screams) it's all for the win.

203
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,467
- I'm so close! Yes, I won.

204
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:34,340
- Oh my gosh. Devan won the first one,

205
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,840
but that doesn't matter because it really

206
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,640
comes down to the Orbeez Obstacle Course

207
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,360
and then I'm thinking we turn ourselves

208
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,720
into human boats so right now, let's go.

209
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,070
Oh this is so hurting me.

210
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,910
To make it across the pool, you challenged us

211
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,790
to turn ourselves into real life human boats

212
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,840
using a whole bunch of ridiculous life hacks

213
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,060
and the first ridiculous life hack is

214
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,242
opening up a soda bottle with an ax. Here we go.

215
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:53,075
3, 2, - What? What? What? What?

216
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:55,629
- One! (explosion)

217
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:56,877
- Oh! - My eye!

218
00:05:56,877 --> 00:05:59,820
- I ran away and it still got me.

219
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,010
- It's in my eye. Dude we blasted the ceiling, bro.

220
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,190
- It's raining. So as you're making a whack boat

221
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,040
over there I'm making a balloon helmet

222
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,940
for my first bit of inflatable boat.

223
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,839
- Don't flip!

224
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,672
(clank)

225
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,024
- Oh! - Come on!

226
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:15,130
- Call me dude perfect. - No. Me. I did that.

227
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,530
- Well, we're both on the channel, so you know.

228
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,580
- Exactly, team work, dynamic duo.

229
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,243
- All right, so I have to blow up some balloons

230
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:21,076
for this balloon helmet.

231
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,048
- Why is there a fire extinguisher though?

232
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,190
- Because I'm doing it with a completely

233
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,100
unrealistic, unnecessary life hack.

234
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,960
- Sound like our channel.

235
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,730
- All you need to know is that I'm making dry ice.

236
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,322
3, 2, 1

237
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:33,905
(spraying) (screaming)

238
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,389
- I wonder what our neighbors are thinking right now.

239
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,270
(spurting)

240
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,790
- So I got some dry ice, it's as simple as that.

241
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,900
- There's nothing.

242
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,650
- You know what man, this is a life hack

243
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,577
that's very important stuff.

244
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:49,830
- For like less than a dollar you can get

245
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,570
way more dry ice than that.

246
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,403
- Collins, life hacks.

247
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:54,580
- Time for me to make the floaty stuff that's

248
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,860
gonna go inside of my little ski pole buoy

249
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,200
over here. So, right now I'm just going to add

250
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,500
in some shaving cream over here.

251
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,333
- All right so I'm going to put this

252
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,252
into the hot water here.

253
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:02,390
- The dry ice? - Yeah.

254
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,459
And boom! - Yo!

255
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:05,753
- It's gonna blow of the balloon. Yeah!

256
00:07:05,753 --> 00:07:07,970
- All right, well, I gotta say, it's

257
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,460
a useless life hack because its

258
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,210
- No, no, no, no. It does granted take a

259
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,350
little bit longer, but it works.

260
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,872
- Want to see another life hack. It's called.

261
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:15,019
(air blowing)

262
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,190
- See, doesn't work.

263
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,460
- The next thing I gotta add in over here

264
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,070
is some corn starch and that's going to let me

265
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,540
add the fluffiness to the substance.

266
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,373
Wait, wait, what are you doing?

267
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:22,870
- Well, it just took too long.

268
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,703
- What happened to your life hack?

269
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:24,536
- I don't got time for that.

270
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:25,737
- You aint got time for this life hack?

271
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,490
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

272
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,530
- This life hack is over.

273
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,363
- I knew you were going to throw it

274
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:31,196
on the ground to be honest.

275
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:33,400
- No. No. I don't break stuff. That's not who I am.

276
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,870
Ya. Yeet. Oh! (splat)

277
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,590
- Well, now that I got all my balloons blown up,

278
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,877
its time to make a waterproof glue.

279
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:39,010
- Wait, now what?

280
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,240
- So I got this mixture here,

281
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,920
which is sugar, water and flour.

282
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,860
- It looks like yogurt.

283
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,945
- So, I'm gonna put this vinegar in here

284
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:46,910
(crash)

285
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,682
- Here we go. I got the no mess corn starch.

286
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:50,650
- That's like a Frisbee, bro. See, look at this, dude.

287
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,879
It's a Frisbee. - Here

288
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,712
- Okay. - Here we go.

289
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:53,883
Go long. - I'm open.

290
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:54,957
- Go long. - I am.

291
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:57,088
- Let's test his speed. - You kidding?

292
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:59,040
(laughter) Collins, I'm over here.

293
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,560
- Yeah, I was testing your speed.

294
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,620
- I thought you were testing the speed of the Frisbee.

295
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,553
- No. That was a test of you Devan.

296
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:05,570
- All right, so I gotta put this vinegar

297
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,770
in here and just stir it up real quick.

298
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,920
All right, so I got this here, this nice glue,

299
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,650
I'm just gonna put it on my helmet.

300
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,483
- Here we go. Just gonna.

301
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:13,316
- Wait, Collins, you're doing what?

302
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:14,411
- I'm gonna add the corn starch.

303
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,845
- What are you? - All right here we go.

304
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,460
- You don't need to do that. Why are you doing that?

305
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:21,340
- All right here we go. 3, 2, 1. Face protected.

306
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,910
Here we go. Gotta rethink it like this.

307
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,105
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Holy cow.

308
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,546
Some of the remnant of what's is called

309
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:27,379
the corn starch got my eyeball.

310
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,659
- Are you saying croissants?

311
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,880
- (laughs) I want croissants.

312
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,610
Can you please take my goggles off?

313
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,410
I can't really talk or see anything.

314
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,243
- There you go. - Okay.

315
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:37,130
- Next, I need some webbed hands.

316
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,910
I have to be able to swim around like a fish.

317
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,743
- Swim around.

318
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:41,290
- I sound like Sid from the 'Ice Age'

319
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,704
(inaudible)

320
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:47,004
To make my webbed hands, I need The Glovenator.

321
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,530
- What in tarnation?

322
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,850
- Bow to its majesty.

323
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,150
- What kind of mid evil contraption is this?

324
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,160
- The first thing you need is a glove. That's right.

325
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,640
If you never want to touch gloves again,

326
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,887
we've got The Glovenator for ya.

327
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:58,110
- But you're touching a glove.

328
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,530
- But just ignore this part.

329
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,174
- Okay. It didn't happen. - Yeah, it did not happen.

330
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,787
All right, so I'm gonna turn on the vacuum seel here

331
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:05,310
and it should just do its thing now.

332
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,590
- Well here we go, I got my ski pole

333
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,740
and I'm gonna stab this in over here and this here

334
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,920
is going to be a flotation buoy.

335
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,130
- How am I supposed to remove it?

336
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,387
- Just put the (mumbles).

337
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,330
- I thought I never had to touch a glove again.

338
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,443
This is falsely advertised.

339
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,730
- Falsely advertised by whom?

340
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,493
(cynical laugh)

341
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,040
All right we're gonna let this thing set

342
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,890
in time for me to make the next part of my human boat.

343
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,102
Here we go. We got these life guard buoys.

344
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:26,830
(bang) - What?

345
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,870
- Saving lives and making them look good in the process.

346
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,800
These are gonna act as the flotation devices on my feet

347
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
in addition to a whole bunch of them boogie boards.

348
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,670
All right, my ski pole flotation devices are all set

349
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,730
and now the last thing I've got to do is hydro-dip them

350
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,028
in a whole bunch of Flex Seal. Here we go. 3, 2, 1.

351
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:42,861
(squish)

352
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:43,910
- You're going to Flex Seal them to the table. Holy cow.

353
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,960
- Aw man. Now we just pull it out, ta-da!

354
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:47,940
- That stuff looks so cool.

355
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,220
- Yep. What are you doing though?

356
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,260
- I am Velcro-ing these pool noodles

357
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,890
to this jacket so I can float.

358
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,921
- I'm gonna dip this one in here.

359
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:54,754
Here we go 3, 2, 1. Boom.

360
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:55,587
- Got it on my jacket. Oh my eye!

361
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:57,803
(squealing)

362
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:59,869
- No! No! I'm going to get this off real quick,

363
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,137
finish all this up and it's time

364
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:02,450
for the reveal of these suits.

365
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,647
We are all suited up in our human boats and bro,

366
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,566
you look absolutely insane.

367
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:07,399
- Thank you.

368
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,260
- Looking at these now, compared to the Orbeez Pool,

369
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,530
I think it's gonna be complete overkill,

370
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,970
so I've got an idea. Let's incorporate

371
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,640
our actual pool into the obstacle course.

372
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,710
Right now, let's head over to the pool,

373
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,543
then we'll jump back into the Orbeez,

374
00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:16,800
but we are going over to the pool now.

375
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,633
- Let's do it.

376
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:18,870
- Now it's time for us to test these life hacks

377
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,140
against our first obstacle, the pool of treatury.

378
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,420
- Dun, dun. Dun.

379
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,700
- Basically, we have to make it all the way

380
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,430
across the pool take off our human boats

381
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,197
and finally jump in the hot tub, hit the buzzer

382
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:28,719
and the first person to do that wins.

383
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,330
I also forgot to mention, there's gonna be

384
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,890
a whole bunch of people throwing water balloons,

385
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,137
giant exercise balls to make it even more interesting.

386
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:36,367
So, now, here's a reveal of our human boats.

387
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:37,500

409
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,619
- [Devan and Collins] 3, 2, 1, ta-da!

410
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:25,252
- [Collins] Look at these man.

411
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,554
- [Devan] Dude!

412
00:11:26,554 --> 00:11:27,387
- Now this is what I'm talking about.

413
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,410
Don't touch me with those weird little noodles.

414
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,380
- I can't even hug you man.

415
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,370
- Yeah, I don't want to be hugged by your weird, little

416
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,330
noodle-y arms. All right the race is about to begin.

417
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,163
You ready Devan?

418
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,039
- Here we go.

419
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,872
(intense music)

420
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:40,122
[Devan And Collins] 3, 2, 1

421
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,505
(air horn) (splash)

422
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,853
- Oh man. No. No. Okay. I got this. What's happening?

423
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:51,853
Screw it. I'm blasting off (inaudible). Oh snap! Ow!

424
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:53,790
(splashing)

425
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,303
I'm going backwards. (inaudible)

426
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:58,470
(screams)

427
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:02,526
- [Devan] This is genius.

428
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:03,696
- Mine is not genius. Okay.

429
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:05,463
- Water balloons are making it ...

430
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:08,066
How much ammo do you guys have? Geez.

431
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:09,235
- I'm gonna make it.

432
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:12,931
(screaming) (laughter)

433
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:13,859
Ah, ow.

434
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,001
(intense music)

435
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,537
- Now for the next part, we gotta get these things off

436
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:18,876
(splash) (laughter)

437
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:20,991
(grunting)

438
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,531
- I gotta get these things off. Darn it. Oh man. Aw, shit.

439
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,948
Okay, here we go, this is for the victory. Here we go.

440
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:27,400
- [Devan] No. No, no, no.

441
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,411
(splash) (victory music)

442
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:30,854
- All right, so I'm the winner of the challenge, except we

443
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:32,680
(splash)

444
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,222
You just got everything soaked.

445
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,168
- What do you mean? So clearly I lost

446
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:37,001
(splat) Oh man.

447
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:39,123
- So now it's on to the next one.

448
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:41,310
All right, we have taken off our human boats,

449
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,830
gotten all dried off and it is finally time to tackle

450
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,180
the Orbeez Obstacle Course.

451
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,382
- What? - in all of its glory, man.

452
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:48,215
- Yes!

453
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:49,360
- So the first thing here is the Wipe Out balls.

454
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,920
We're going to have to bounce our way across these

455
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,880
then we're gonna make it to the punching wall over there,

456
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,533
have to throw balloons at a target.

457
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,440
Once you hit the target you can move on to the next part,

458
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,830
which is the teeter totter wall.

459
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,290
Once you make it over that, you gotta cross

460
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,615
the boogie boards, climb up on the scaffolding

461
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:03,040
and finally pop all the balloons as you look

462
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,304
for the final end buzzer.

463
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:05,960
Oh I also forgot to mention, there's gonna be

464
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,423
a whole bunch of people throwing water balloons,

465
00:13:07,423 --> 00:13:08,630
and maybe even more interesting things.

466
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,983
Whoever hits that buzzer first, they win.

467
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:11,200
- It's gonna be me.

468
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,033
- I don't know about that.

469
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:13,270
Now, in my opinion, the most difficult part

470
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,610
of this entire obstacle course is going to be trying

471
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,270
to throw those water balloons at a target

472
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,720
while getting punched a whole bunch of times.

473
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,910
- Oh, so that's where we light the watermelon?

474
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,824
- No, no, no. Not yet, Devan.

475
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:20,657
- No? Not Yet?

476
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:21,550
- We're just wait on the watermelon, trust me,

477
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,639
it's gonna be used at the perfect moment.

478
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,192
The life hack that I'm focusing on is making sure

479
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:25,700
that I don't get punched once.

480
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,870
- Oo. Okay, well I think the hardest part of this course

481
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,110
is gonna be that teeter totter,

482
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,268
so I'm gonna make a life hack to help me get over that.

483
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,890
- All right, right now, let's go make our life hacks

484
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,980
and then its time to jump in to the

485
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,450
Orbeez Obstacle Course, so let's go.

486
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,283
- Yes!

487
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,260
- In preparation for the Ultimate Wipe Out Course,

488
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,506
we're making some DIY shields.

489
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:39,960
- And I'm making some sticky gloves.

490
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,620
- Yes, we are. Oh, no. That was not called for Devan.

491
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,453
- Sorry. Whoa!

492
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:45,270
(cynical laugh) - Fear

493
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,948
So the first life hack I'm doing is basically this tube

494
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:49,061
right here, you see this thing that's filled with water?

495
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,820
Well, this is gonna be the strap that I use

496
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,680
across satchel side. If you can just cut

497
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,513
right there for me.

498
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:55,265
- I'm with it. I'm with it. All right. Sure. 3, 2, 1,

499
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,493
(water spraying)

500
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:57,643
- (screams) There we go.

501
00:13:57,643 --> 00:14:00,727
(laughter) (squealing)

502
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:03,144
(indistinct)

503
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,470
- That was not what I expected. Okay, here we go.

504
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,340
3, 2, 1 (splash)

505
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,919
Oh there we go.

506
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,614
- First DIY is done and I gotta say,

507
00:14:14,614 --> 00:14:16,480
I think it was a complete win across the board,

508
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,330
couldn't have gone better.

509
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,480
- Bam. Are you kidding me?

510
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,220
- I'm not kidding Devan. I'm for reals.

511
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,710
- We did all of that, for that?

512
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,940
- Exactly, because now it's stretched.

513
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,240
- For my sticky glove, I'm making a rowing glove,

514
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,390
which is a life hack apparently, so we'll find out.

515
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,340
You ready? - Wait.

516
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:32,546
- [Devan and Collins] What?

517
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:33,379
- Yo are you all right dude, are you okay?

518
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:34,212
- I think I might be stuck.

519
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:36,690
- Holy, yeah, I think it is stuck man, what is going on?

520
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,670
- So this is gonna be the mold for my glove

521
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,830
and I have no idea how I'm gonna get my hand out.

522
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,730
- You seemed to use some sorcery magic to get it end there,

523
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,070
so maybe you need some sorcery magic to get it out, Devan.

524
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,855
Lucky for you, I have a very industrial magic wand.

525
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:50,210
Here we go now I gotta send a magic words.

526
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,769
Ready Devan, I'm gonna aim for your heart.

527
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:52,898
- What? Why?

528
00:14:52,898 --> 00:14:53,731
- It's the only way to make this work

529
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:54,707
so stand like this so I can see you.

530
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,060
- Okay - Here we go 3, 2, 1

531
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,893
Abra-crowbar-dabra

532
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:59,044
- Ugh, my spleen - Oh sorry about that.

533
00:14:59,044 --> 00:14:59,877
Here we go, here we go.

534
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:01,100
(screams)

535
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,184
- My full intestine! Ow.

536
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,611
- This thing is not accurate, but the real question:

537
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,690
How did it help the thing?

538
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,620
- Ta-da!

539
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,070
- A dab for the the Crowbar-dabra. Respectfully.

540
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,914
- [Devan] So, nicely done.

541
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:12,747
- [Collins] That's going to be the mold?

542
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,570
- Yes. This will be the mold for my sticky glove.

543
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,650
- All right and this is going to be the base

544
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,010
of my shield cause here's the thing.

545
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,880
As we go across this Wipe Out obstacle course

546
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,820
there's gonna be a whole bunch of objects flying at us

547
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,020
that we got to like dodge and protect to make sure

548
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,070
we don't get knocked off the course.

549
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,470
So, first thing I gotta do when you're trying

550
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,840
to hold the shield what don't you want? A handle.

551
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm making my own custom handle because this handle,

552
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,750
not reliable. I need something that I know

553
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,992
is battle tested and can take, I don't know shrimps.

554
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:34,000
Cause who knows what they're going

555
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,420
to be throwing at us man. Like shrimps could be

556
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,520
coming flying. You'd be like a shrimp cocktail.

557
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,720
- That's what you're most concerned about? Shrimp?

558
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,440
- Dude, flying shrimps are crazy bro?

559
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,500
- Are they? - Oh yeah.

560
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,460
- All right. - A lot of legs.

561
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,160
I'm gonna pop the handle off.

562
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,750
- You're bending the shield, dude.

563
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,153
- Okay, I think we are going to revert to the other way.

564
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,202
- Wow. All right, so now that my mold is made

565
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,118
I have this silicone here

566
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:57,153
(crash) - I'll figure out how to get

567
00:15:57,153 --> 00:15:58,700
this handle off, don't you worry.

568
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,397
- I'm gonna pour into here for my sticky glove.

569
00:16:00,397 --> 00:16:01,371
You ready for this? - Yes.

570
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:02,468
- All right.

571
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:04,280
- Dude, this handle is not coming off.

572
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,236
- [Devan] 3, 2, 1. Oh, dude look at the colors

573
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:09,931
in this thing it looks so good.

574
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:12,189
(elevator music)

575
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:15,033
(rock music) (banging)

576
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:15,866
- Hey! I got it!

577
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:17,070
- Now that the silicone is on the inside,

578
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,460
I'm gonna let this solidify off to the side here

579
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,036
and now I'm gonna melt down some of these sticky hands.

580
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:23,369
- While you do that, time for me to get my shield

581
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:24,202
to be a little bit more flat cause right now

582
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:26,100
it looks like what it is, which is a trash can lid.

583
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,720
Do you mind holding this for one second?

584
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,553
- Whoa

585
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,570
- I'll place it like this, a little hat for ya.

586
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,513
Here we go, old fashioned, it's one of Devan's passions.

587
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,876
I'm just going to pick this up over here.

588
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,260
Ah, it's very heavy.

589
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,430
- Collins, you see what I'm doing over here?

590
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,777
It's pretty genius.

591
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:38,610
(grunting)

592
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,720
I'm gonna move my heavy equipment over here.

593
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,553
This stuff is great.

594
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:43,067
- I'm melting down sticky hands for my sticky gloves, bro.

595
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,160
- Where did my trash can lid go? Hold on.

596
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,440
- What do you mean, it's on my head.

597
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,873
- Oh, well alrighty. Let's, let's see,

598
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,290
I'm just gonna take it like this.

599
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,310
I don't know how to use this to be completely honest.

600
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,070
- [Devan] Dude, this isn't actually working very well.

601
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,780
- You and me both Devan. You and me both.

602
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,285
So therefore Captain America Shield the background.

603
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,285
(crash)

604
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:02,927
I'm just saying, I could be in the movies.

605
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:04,655
- Yeah, no, Collins, it has to come back.

606
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,350
- The only unfortunate thing is that

607
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,330
this isn't quite Vibranium. I think it's called

608
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,880
Aluminum and it is bent quite out of shape.

609
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,180
- If you're having trouble bending Aluminum, bro,

610
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,920
I cannot imagine you as a superhero.

611
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,290
- Oh, you came at me. - Aluminum.

612
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,190
- That was uncalled for.

613
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,507
- That's aluminum not Vibranium, bro.

614
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:20,340
- Nice.

615
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,940
- You know, instead of doing this, I think I'm just gonna

616
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,550
put it in the oven to heat it up. This is terrible.

617
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,250
Dude, look at the hand that I got out of the mold.

618
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,850
- Wait a minute, couldn't you have just used a regular

619
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,317
glove instead of filling that.

620
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:31,190
- No. This is useless life hacks, bro.

621
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,007
- I forgot. This is a useless life hack here.

622
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:34,250
Our next step (crash) oh! No.

623
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,180
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

624
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,107
- A lot of paint! These things are filled with paint.

625
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:39,150
This was, again, another terrible life hack

626
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,420
because they didn't stay on here, so here's the deal

627
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,450
I got to paint my shield for no other reason

628
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,030
than aesthetically its gotta look beautiful

629
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,780
as I'm on the Wipe Out course because you guys

630
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,903
know me, aesthetic beauty is my main thing.

631
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:49,890
It's what I'm known for. So here we go.

632
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,410
I'm just gonna empty out the stuff like this.

633
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,530
- Dude, we're actually doing something similar,

634
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,598
but this is actually the melted down sticky hands.

635
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:56,927
- Happy to hear that Devan.

636
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:58,860
We got a little paint on here and this is a life hack

637
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,300
I saw on TikTok, so I don't know if it's actually

638
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,500
gonna work or not, but this way,

639
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,480
I'm making it look really cool.

640
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,290
So usually I'm not the artsy one, but this time

641
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,239
I think I am. Here we go, 3, 2, 1.

642
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,162
- Whoa

643
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:07,995
(crash)

644
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:08,828
Nice slip.

645
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:10,900
- That got paint everywhere man, look at this.

646
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,970
On the top of it ta-da!

647
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,820
- It looks like trash.

648
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,920
Dude, I can't believe these melted down sticky hands

649
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,040
actually worked, now all I gotta do is just peel

650
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,873
it off of this mold and then I'm done.

651
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,694
- So we just got to finish these things up

652
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:22,197
and then its time to tackle tie Wipe Out obstacle course.

653
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:24,130
All right, we finished up our life hacks

654
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,620
and these are gonna be so important to make sure

655
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,830
we make it across the obstacle course.

656
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,040
Mine's a shield to make sure not one

657
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,240
punches me on that punch wall.

658
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,547
- And man these gloves are sticky, dude.

659
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:32,720
- All right so now it's time to go place these

660
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,860
exactly where they need to be on the obstacle course.

661
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,340
- So, I'm gonna put my gloves over here

662
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,760
so that they're ready for the wall.

663
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,560
- I almost just tripped man, that's not a good sign

664
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,915
for this obstacle course if I'm already tripping.

665
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:42,310
- It's hot. - It is hot.

666
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,867
- Holy cow. Oh geez. Okay. I'm gonna put it.

667
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,020
- Put it down, put it down, put it down.

668
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,853
- Shield's there, good to go.

669
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:47,117
- All right, let's hop back over.

670
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:47,950
- Whew. It's hot.

671
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,920
- For the first leg here is the Wipe Out balls.

672
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,480
We have to bounce our way across these

673
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,010
then we're gonna make it to the punching wall

674
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,250
over there, have to throw balloons at a target.

675
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,000
Once you hit the target, you move on to the next part

676
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,380
which is the teeter totter wall.

677
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,500
Once you make it over that you gotta

678
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
cross the boogie boards, climb up on the scaffolding,

679
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,140
and finally pop all the balloons

680
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,007
as you look for the final end buzzer.

681
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:06,250
Oh, I also forgot to mention,

682
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,210
there's gonna be a whole bunch of people

683
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,320
throwing water balloons

684
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,200
and maybe even more interesting things.

685
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,990
Whoever hits that buzzer first, they win.

686
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,823
- It's gonna be me.

687
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:12,656
- I don't know about that.

688
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:14,420
We'll decide who goes first with a classic game

689
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,500
of rock, paper, scissors.

690
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,333
- Let's do it. Here we go.

691
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,650
- [Devan and Collins] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Oo!

692
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,605
- Nice to meet you.

693
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:20,027
- [Devan and Collins] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

694
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:21,320
- Aye! - Man!

695
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,740

00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:37,827
- [Devan and Collins] 3, 2, 1 - Oh!

705
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:41,290
- Oh dude, holy cow! I took a ball to the face.

706
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,266
I gotta get back on, I gotta get back on.

707
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,268
- Wait. No, no, no.

708
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,101
- Do it, do it.

709
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,982
(screaming) (laughing)

710
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:48,008
(splashing)

711
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,310
- [Collins] Okay. Here we go. Come on (inaudible).

712
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,143
Spoiler alert: Attack

713
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,280
(whistle) (splash)

714
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,030
- [Devan] No. No. No.

715
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,110
- It got me. Not me. Give me your hand,

716
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,901
I want to get you through this. Here we go.

717
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:58,900
(splash)

718
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,871
Dude, that was right on his shins (laughter)

719
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:03,821
Quick pause. We need to give Devan some CPR here.

720
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:08,084
(inaudible) go like this. Is it working?

721
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:08,917
- Hold on. Hold on.

722
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:09,750
- Come on across.

723
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,908
- Here we go. Here we go. Okay. There we go.

724
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:12,427
We're gonna pretend like that worked.

725
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:14,117
- All right we made it through obstacle number one

726
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:15,577
and now it's time to throw water balloons,

727
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:17,050
hit the target without getting punched.

728
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,883
Where' my life hack? (splash)

729
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,840
All right so I got my shield here.

730
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,976
The issue with this is like an anti-life hack.

731
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:21,744
I'm not left handed, but I've gotta be left handed.

732
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:22,740
Here we go. (grunts)

733
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,597
(splash) Oh geez. That was (inaudible)

734
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:25,828
- Ow. - Oh my god.

735
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:28,163
(screaming) (splash)

736
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:30,803
(inaudible)

737
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:31,959
- This is super tough.

738
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:32,946
- [Man] Heads up there.

739
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:33,779
- I got a shield man. The shield's not working.

740
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:34,612
- It feels like were going on.

741
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:35,756
(grunting) (splashing)

742
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:38,640
- Ouch. That was to my head.

743
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,556
- I think this is good.

744
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:40,389
- Here we go.

745
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:41,395
- I think it's good.

746
00:20:41,395 --> 00:20:42,228
(splash) (cheering)

747
00:20:42,228 --> 00:20:43,923
- All right. All right. Come on. Do it.

748
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:44,756
- I got to get this. Here we go.

749
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:47,111
Guys, here we go, here we go.

750
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:47,944
- Lose!

751
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:48,777
(cheering)

752
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:49,610
- No, no, no, no.

753
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,098
- [Group] 3, 2, 1, Oh!

754
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:53,945
- You made it. What? He's like Spider Man.

755
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:55,019
- Whoa. Okay. All right.

756
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:55,885
- You want me to push you over?

757
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:57,663
- Oh yes. Wow!

758
00:20:57,663 --> 00:21:01,110
- Devan. Flip it my way.

759
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,576
- There's no way you're getting around this, bro.

760
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:03,650
- Whoa. Man that's not right.

761
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,430
- No. You ain't getting around this.

762
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,701
(grunting)

763
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,784
- Oh, my shins! Holy cow!

764
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,963
- It's back. There you go, I've had it.

765
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:14,324
- Oh! That was close.

766
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:15,157
- All right, here we go.

767
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:15,990
It's gonna go forward,

768
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,823
but I'm not really fully committed.

769
00:21:16,823 --> 00:21:18,720
Oh, that was a weird place to get hit.

770
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,991
No. No, no, no, no, no. No. No. No. No.

771
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:22,348
(splashing)

772
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,867
(laughter)

773
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,250
I just got clocked by a mystery ball.

774
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,210
- Come on bro, it's--

775
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,320
- What Devan?

776
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,181
- Yes. - Aw, what? Holy cow!

777
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:33,014
(laughter)

778
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:33,847
You know what, that was actually very close.

779
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:34,680
- No.

780
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,656
(splashing)

781
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:37,317
- Oh, that's concrete on my knee.

782
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:39,610
- Thank you for not hitting me at point blank range,

783
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,443
I appreciate it.

784
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:41,467
(water spraying) (screaming)

785
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,967
- Okay. All right.

786
00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:46,879
- Oh, no way!

787
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,765
- Yeah! Yes!

788
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,057
- All right, you know what, the boogie boards

789
00:21:50,057 --> 00:21:50,890
have just submerged, so just imagine

790
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,920
I'm stepping on the boogie boards right now.

791
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,227
- Wait. Wait. How do we pop them?

792
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:54,303
- With my hands.

793
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:55,572
(nylon squeaking)

794
00:21:55,572 --> 00:21:56,405
- Nope. Not there.

795
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:57,510
- All right, good. I got to find this button

796
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,367
to make it before you do.

797
00:21:58,367 --> 00:21:59,464
(screaming) (balloons popping)

798
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:01,931
- Ew, I got hit in the chest. (splash)

799
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:03,450
(laughter) - Brutal, man.

800
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,410
Holy cow, I don't know how many more hits I can take.

801
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,510
- Dude, my eye!

802
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,540
- Don't try this at home, all right guys.

803
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,000
We are a little bit high up right now.

804
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,010
There's only a few balloons left

805
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,959
to try to get here (inaudible).

806
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,492
There's the buzzer! It went into the Orbeez.

807
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:14,682
Holy cow, we got to get there.

808
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:16,880
We got to get that person down.

809
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,730
- [Devan] My eye!

810
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,592
- Here we go.

811
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:20,425
- No! Man.

812
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,603
- Yes, and I won the Orbeez Obstacle Course.

813
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:27,010
You know what that means. I get to light

814
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,400
the matches watermelon, man.

815
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,060
- I wanted to do that so bad.

816
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,430
- The ultimate prize, so right now, let's go light it up.

817
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,220
It is finally time to reveal what's up

818
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,810
with this life hack here, and since I won

819
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,810
the majority of the obstacles,

820
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,600
that means I get to demonstrate it's awesome power.

821
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,314
- I'm so bummed. I don't even know what this is for.

822
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:42,520
- If you were to take a guess,

823
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,110
what do you think this life hack is for, Devan?

824
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,227
- Uh, haircuts? I don't know.

825
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:47,040
- Haircuts? No, no, no, Think about it.

826
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,873
- A bowl cut, you know?

827
00:22:47,873 --> 00:22:48,890
It's like in a watermelon bowl.

828
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:49,750
- Basically I took a watermelon

829
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,990
stuffed with a whole bunch of matches

830
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,640
and are you ready for the big reveal

831
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,606
of what this life hack is?

832
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,029
(drum roll) 3, 2, 1.

833
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:56,550
The ultimate pool light! - Are you kidding?

834
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,900
- As you can tell, the pool light 3000.

835
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,733
- That's what it is?

836
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,150
- Imagine it just glistening and glowing in the light, man.

837
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,320
- Does it actually float though?

838
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,070
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no.

839
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,220
- It doesn't really float.

840
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,053
- Yeah, get it out.

841
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,230
- It doesn't really float.

842
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,000
- You're gonna mess up my matches, Devan.

843
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,220
- Kind of floats, but not really.

844
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,410
- Holy cow. All right, so, grab the lighter

845
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,365
and we gotta say do not try this at home.

846
00:23:15,365 --> 00:23:16,198

- Dude, I didn't have it.

863
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:37,927
- Are you kidding me? That was you.

864
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:38,810
- I only have one hand. - Butterfingers.

865
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,120
- I was handing you the lighter.

866
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,406
- Dude, its ruined, bro.

867
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:44,623
We're gonna have to swim in the darkness now, Devan.

868
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,533
- I was so ready to light this thing.

869
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:47,620
- Come on. I think it still works.

870
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,453
Try to light it. (inaudible)

871
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:50,071
- I'm so hoping it still works.

872
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:50,904
- All right, hold it away from my face.

873
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:51,737
- [Collins] Oh, please, please.

874
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:52,570
Nothing.

875
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,403
Yo, I spent hours on this.

876
00:23:53,403 --> 00:23:54,416
- Are you kidding?

877
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,370
- You know what, I'm gonna have to retry this
