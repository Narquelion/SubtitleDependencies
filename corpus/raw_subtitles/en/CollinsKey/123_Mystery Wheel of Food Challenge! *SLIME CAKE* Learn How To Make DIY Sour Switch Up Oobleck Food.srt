1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,606
- It's a slime cake! - Aaahhh!

2
00:00:01,606 --> 00:00:02,439
- And you-- - Oh!

3
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:03,884
(glass shattering)

4
00:00:03,884 --> 00:00:04,717
- Oh no! - Why?

5
00:00:04,717 --> 00:00:05,971
- You killed the mystery wheel of slime challenge.

6
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,862
- Dude, we were gonna eat that.

7
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:08,695
- What's wrong with the cake? - Why?

8
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:09,654
- Oh no. Well, luckily we've got some mystery wheels

9
00:00:09,654 --> 00:00:12,400
so right now now, let's make some new cakes.

10
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,386
Oh my god - What?

11
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:15,601
- So this round you challenged us to do a mystery cake.

12
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,797
- Eww.

13
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:18,443
- So right now, let's spin for our first ingredient.

14
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:19,276
3, 2, 1.

15
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:21,804
Let's see what we got.

16
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:22,817
- Alright. - Are you kidding me?

17
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:23,650
- What?

18
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,661
- I got ground beef.

19
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,212
- What? Good luck with that, Collins.

20
00:00:26,212 --> 00:00:27,188
I got Fruity Pebbles.

21
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:29,074
- Dude, look at this. - I'm so excited.

22
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:30,634
- Ground beef in cake?

23
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:32,243
- Oh, it smells so bad.

24
00:00:32,243 --> 00:00:34,458
- I guess first we got to actually make the cake.

25
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,391
Slow yourself down a little bit.

26
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:36,224
- Oh, okay.

27
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:37,930
- We've got some water. We need three eggs.

28
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,316
- This is called crack-a-dack with a Mcalice whack

29
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:40,216
with a pick-ack.

30
00:00:40,216 --> 00:00:41,049
(crack)

31
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:41,882
- That's like the worst ever.

32
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:44,721
- Augh! I'm gonna use the back of my swisk.

33
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:45,868
Back of my swisk! - Alright.

34
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:46,701
- There we go.

35
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:48,277
- Alright, time to add my oil.

36
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:50,306
- Next up, we got to add the batter.

37
00:00:50,306 --> 00:00:53,313
- In true Collins fashion. Oh! Oh! Oh! Be careful.

38
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:55,254
- I'm just opening up the box.

39
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:57,945
- No. It's already mixed. What are you doing?

40
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:00,110
No. I know that face. I know that-

41
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,982
What did I say?

42
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:02,376
- I have not made cake in a very long time.

43
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:03,950
Whip it through the sauce, boy.

44
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,117
- Whisk master supreme!

45
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:06,856
- Oh! What on Earth was that?!

46
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:08,847
- I'm sure it has to do with Science.

47
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:10,411
- No, it has to do with centrifugal force!

48
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,894
- Here we go. Ooh, uh-oh.

49
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:14,881
- Time to add in my feared ingredient: beef.

50
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:16,404
Gonna add it, like, chunk by chunk.

51
00:01:16,404 --> 00:01:18,762
- Oh yeah. Oh it's so colorful!

52
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:20,345
- I'm gonna make the craziest beef cake of all,

53
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:21,886
so I'm gonna add-add-add

54
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:24,915
- Mine is like the most delicious cereal ever!

55
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:26,011
- That looks so good.

56
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:26,844
- It, yeah.

57
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:29,728
- Time to spin for our next ingredient: 3, 2, 1-

58
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:31,724
I'm waiting for the countdown, here we go.

59
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,934
- Oh yes! You're not gonna believe it, bro!

60
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,107
I got skittles! Yes!

61
00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:37,630
- Congratulations, you know what I got?

62
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,463
Yellow onions! Oh my gosh, bro, a legit onion!

63
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:45,303
- Oh yeah! Look at that!

64
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:48,313
- I'm gonna use the technique from watching a lot of chefs.

65
00:01:48,313 --> 00:01:50,122
- I'm sorry, what chef are you watching?

66
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:51,745
- Well, there's only one other thing to do

67
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,345
and that is to get the onion to- open up.

68
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:56,858
- You clearly have never peeled an onion before.

69
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:58,116
- I just gotta peel this off because this

70
00:01:58,116 --> 00:01:59,185
is getting in the way right now.

71
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,283
You're not helping me!

72
00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:02,415
Alright! Time to spin for the next ingredient.

73
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,081
- I hope I get some good luck!

74
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,356
- 3, 2, come on!

75
00:02:05,356 --> 00:02:06,668
- What are you waiting for? Come on!

76
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,867
- Alright. Got green!

77
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:10,569
- Nooo! Dude! I got kimchi!

78
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:14,551
- Bro! I got Resse's dude! This is the best day ever.

79
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,921
- This is like the worst day ever!

80
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:18,594
When opening Kimchi, you gotta be very careful.

81
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:19,888
Oh no!

82
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:20,721
- Why?

83
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:24,076
- Oh no. Alright, there we go, a little bit there, Ugh!

84
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:27,156
- This is just getting better and better all the time, dude.

85
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:30,195
- The final ingredient, here we go! 3, 2, 1!

86
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:32,409
- Oh my gosh! Please be something good!

87
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:33,588
- I already know mine's gonna be good!

88
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,111
- Dude, I need something good. Let's see what I got!

89
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:35,944
- Blue!

90
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:36,908
- I got- wait you got blue?

91
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,574
You get dark blue? I got dark blue too!

92
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:39,561
- No! I got jalapenos!

93
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,958
- Wait no! I got switch! How?

94
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,158
- Yes!

95
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:44,098
- What?!

96
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,616
- I'm gonna pick up this lovely, delicious thing here.

97
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:47,668
A couple jalapenos to this delicious cake!

98
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,770
Oh! That's all the juice. Come on out, jalapenos!

99
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,990
Well, these are the cakes and we'll be

100
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,952
popping these into the oven to finish cooking them

101
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:54,293
and we'll be eating these at the end of the video,

102
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:56,376
so comment down below right now: who won this round?

103
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,899
And we are on to the next one!

104
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,913
It's pizza time, so guys, we are going to be making

105
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,269
a crazy mystery pizza right now, so uh-

106
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,570
- Wait, dude, how did you do that?

107
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,940
- I'm actually a pizza master, but I'm just in disguise

108
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,909
right now, so let me go back to my true form!

109
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:10,203
Bam! There we go! You look like a pizza chef now, Devin.

110
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:11,036
- No I don't!

111
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:11,993
- That's how all pizza chefs dress.

112
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:14,549
- No, no, okay, no. I'm not an actual pizza!

113
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:15,682
- Well, if you're not wearing yours,

114
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:17,018
I'm not wearing mine! That's not fair!

115
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:17,851
I think it's stuck.

116
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:19,506
So now let's spin for our first ingredient!

117
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:21,993
Here we go, 3, 2, 1! Man, I want a good pizza!

118
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,036
Yeah Boy! Dude, red sauce!

119
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,931
- And I got Nutella! I'm so happy with mine!

120
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:30,385
This is great! I'm just gonna do one blob in the middle,

121
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:31,218
- There we go!

122
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:32,873
- Oh that looks good. You're going all out.

123
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:34,509
- This is the proper amount of red sauce.

124
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:35,342
- Oh, really?

125
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:36,595
- That looks actually really cool.

126
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:37,428
- Yeah!

127
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:39,715
- Time for the next spin! Here we go! 3, 2, 1!

128
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:43,381
Alright here we go. Oh yes! I got cheese!

129
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,348
- And I got lettuce!

130
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,181
- Lettuce?

131
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,928
- That's a little weird. So when it said lettuce,

132
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:48,714
I did not expect it to be this.

133
00:03:48,714 --> 00:03:49,994
- Lettuce boy number one.

134
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:51,293
- Lettuce boy number two.

135
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:52,126
- Whoa.

136
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:52,959
So I guess we'll just-

137
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,359
- I mean, like all of it! Yeah!

138
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,039
It's like a traditional pizza.

139
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,750
- 3, 2, 1! That was a terrible spin.

140
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,574
- Alright, let's see what I got. Ooh! I got Oreos!

141
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,925
- I got pepperoni! Mine's gonna be a great pizza! Yes!

142
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:06,816
- This is so good!

143
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:10,159
- About to take my game to the next level. Bam! 3, 2, 1!

144
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,907
Oh man, I hope I get another pizza ingredient

145
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:13,816
because this is looking so good!

146
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:16,011
- Yeah, mine could go either way right now.

147
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:17,157
- Ooh, I got red again.

148
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:17,990
- Pineapple!

149
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,688
- And I got Ramen. Wait, Ramen.

150
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:21,415
That's kind of weird, but alright.

151
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:23,171
- And then you also got some seasoning packets here.

152
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,106
You gotta add these, too.

153
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:24,989
- Whoa, hey, that's my seasoning.

154
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:26,381
- Alright so he's gonna add that,

155
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:28,858
and now I got my pineapple, so I'll-

156
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:29,691
- Oh! I just pulled a Collins.

157
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:30,524
- Time to add some pineapple.

158
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:31,522
(Buzzer sound)

159
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:35,591
No! Wait I got disqualified?! Oh, I can't put pineapple

160
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,348
on pizza, I forgot. Oh! I'm spilling the juices.

161
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:39,032
Alright, this is just falling apart here.

162
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:40,473
Well, I was disqualified, but you can still

163
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:41,604
comment down below if you think that

164
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:42,771
I shouldn't have been disqualified

165
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:43,868
for the pie that one made.

166
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:44,701
- No, not an option.

167
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,972
- Alright, it's time to eat the pizzas.

168
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,962
So the back of my pizza got pretty burnt

169
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:50,410
in the oven. We've got to cut it so let's-

170
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,635
that does not look like a slice of pizza at all.

171
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:53,469
- What did you do?

172
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:55,163
- Oh no! I lost the cheese!

173
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:55,996
- 3, 2, 1.

174
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,031
- Too big.

175
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,755
- Oh, not a fan of pineapple pizza? Yeah, me neither.

176
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:04,132
- Mine was kind of eh. What's yours gonna be like?

177
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:06,532
- I think it's gonna be very interesting.

178
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:07,403
- How are you gonna eat that?

179
00:05:07,403 --> 00:05:10,432
- There we go! Ramen right there, got Oreos, got lettuce.

180
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:11,376
Alright, here we go!

181
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:12,952
- But wait, five second subscribe challenge!

182
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:14,522
We want to see if you can subscribe to the channel

183
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,309
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

184
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:20,226
Are you ready? 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, done!

185
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:23,810
Alright let's see how this thing tastes.

186
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,310
- Alright, here we go. Oh! (mumbling)

187
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:32,270
- So this round, you challenged us to make mystery sushi,

188
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,039
so right now let's spin for our first ingredient.

189
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,070
Here we go. That was a solid spin.

190
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,127
- Mine was not.

191
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:38,459
- I got avocado.

192
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:39,495
- I got cucumber.

193
00:05:39,495 --> 00:05:41,629
- So I've heard how you make sushi is you take rice-

194
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,640
you're cutting off my rice supply.

195
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,159
- Yes I am, uh huh. Don't take all of it.

196
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,318
- There's like, thousands left.

197
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:49,654
- You call this thousands of pieces?

198
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,075
- You see what we're having here is not quite

199
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:52,245
an even distribution-

200
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:53,751
- Mine is sticking to my hand.

201
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:56,738
- You're like Spiderman. You're the rice man.

202
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:58,619
Rice just sticks to you, that's just your power.

203
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,224
- You know what? That would actually be really nice

204
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:02,467
if I was skydiving and my parachute failed,

205
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:03,858
because I'd just land on a ton of rice.

206
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:04,905
- I think I got my rice layered,

207
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,470
now I just gotta get the little bit off my hands now.

208
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,341
I call this the rub-a-dub-dub-

209
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:10,772
- Is yours also stuck to your hands?

210
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:12,431
- You're rice man, I'll be rice boy!

211
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:13,743
Now it's time to add my first ingredient.

212
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:15,052
My hands are still a little bit rice-y.

213
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:17,542
A little bit of avocado there. It's an S

214
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,333
Super Rice Boy! Woohoo!

215
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,546
- Time to add my cucumber.

216
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,207
- Time to spin for the next mystery ingredient

217
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,694
so here we go 3, 2, 1! Solid spin

218
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:26,241
- Did your rice come off?

219
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:29,045
- I'm no longer Rice Boy, I'm just normal Collins.

220
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,828
(sad music)

221
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:34,640
- Bro no! I got canned tuna!

222
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,473
- How is that bad?

223
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:37,476
- It's not like, you know, normal sushi.

224
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:39,149
I don't think they do canned tuna, do they?

225
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,138
- Well that's true, it's like a fish.

226
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,935
You know what I got? Swedish Fish!

227
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,039
I knew we were missing something: the Nori sheets!

228
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:44,872
- Oh! You're right!

229
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,518
- We were supposed to put these down first,

230
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:47,472
that way it doesn't stick!

231
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,342
- Oh man! I can do it, I can do it.

232
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,648
I'm gonna put this on the table,

233
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:52,093
and I'm just gonna flip it upside down.

234
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:55,486
You ready? 3, 2, 1. Done. Perfectly done.

235
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:56,431
- You lost all the cucumbers though.

236
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:58,125
- Nope. I didn't, you saw nothing.

237
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,849
Now I just grab my Nori sheet like a taco,

238
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,425
and then put it on top, and we're done!

239
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:04,507
Look at that. Ha!

240
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,430
- Oh no!

241
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,263
- Really dude?

242
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:08,291
- I have none left. That doesn't look very edible.

243
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,566
- Don't complain about my food quality standards. Boom!

244
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:11,920
- Collins, do you have a can opener?

245
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,992
- Yep. That doesn't look like it's opening-

246
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,134
you're just making marks on the table, bro!

247
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:17,343
- You should use a can opener, Devin.

248
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:18,176
- What, yeah?!

249
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,009
- I can get one for you here, here we go.

250
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,008
Bam! Got my Swedish Fish back!

251
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,650
- What? Swedish Fish? You were supposed

252
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,902
to get me a can opener.

253
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,344
- I'll do it for you, but you gotta get me

254
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:27,329
something in return.

255
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:29,657
- I will grant you your powers of Rice Boy.

256
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,298
- Yeah! Alright check this out. I'm Rice Boy again!

257
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:33,923
Boom! Woohoo!

258
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:35,102
- Thank you! Alright! Oh wow.

259
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:36,443
- Alright, here we go. So you're gonna put the Swedish Fish

260
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:38,097
all over my sushi.

261
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:39,633
- Oh, that looks bad.

262
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,299
- I was just enjoying my Swedish Fish,

263
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:43,014
and then bleh, tuna!

264
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:45,127
- It's all runny and watery, dude!

265
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:46,116
- I'm just gonna keep this under my nose,

266
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:46,965
it smells a lot better.

267
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:47,916
I feel like a scuba diver.

268
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,794
- Ew, these chunks!

269
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:51,106
- That's more than enough tuna, bro.

270
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:54,856
- 3, 2, 1. I'm gonna hope it lands on yellow.

271
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,497
- What came off it?

272
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:58,565
- I think I broke it.

273
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,191
Oh! So close to yellow

274
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:01,857
- What happens if it did land on yellow?

275
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,981
- Nothing. Oh no! I got ketchup! The wrong sauce!

276
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:07,606
- I got ginger-

277
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:08,541
- That's normal.

278
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,076
- But you don't put it in the sushi.

279
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,404
I'm expected to put this whole root-

280
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:14,279
- What is it?

281
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,112
- This is the ginger root!

282
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:15,945
- Oh! That's ginger root! I was like,

283
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:17,356
"Why do you have a branch with you?"

284
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:18,443
- I didn't know it was hairy.

285
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:20,820
- Oh wow. I suddenly smell it. Let me smell it.

286
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,250
- Wait, how do you even eat this bro, like?

287
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,333
- No! Dude why would you?

288
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:28,257
- That's hot. Wow!

289
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,090
- Is it spicy?

290
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,923
- Yeah.

291
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:33,793
- The spatula of wonder! Check this out: 3, 2, 1, Bam!

292
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:36,140
There we go! Got the ginger for you! Cue the music!

293
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,307
(Humming)

294
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:43,483
- Is this like a ballerina song or something?

295
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:46,983
I think you've totally messed up the song!

296
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,348
Dude, what are you doing?

297
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,680
- There you go. That's how you-

298
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,837
I shouldn't have done that...

299
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:56,001
Check this out: Nori sheet flower.

300
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,812
- Oh, I like it.

301
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:00,571
- It's almost like a flower, but, it is.

302
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,801
- Use your imagination.

303
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:02,634
- Devin, are you ready?

304
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:03,467
- I'm so ready.

305
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:07,633
- Collins, are you ready? Yes, just gotta make sure!

306
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,335
- Oh what? Did it fly off? What's your prediction?

307
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:10,168
- Yellow.

308
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:11,595
- Mine's green.

309
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:14,466
- Oh snap, I got yellow! Yes!

310
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:17,531
Oh! Dude, read them out on the count of three.

311
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:18,887
1, 2, 3, wasabi!

312
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,887
- Wasabi! Wait, you got wasabi, too!

313
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,996
- Man! Well, I guess we gotta finish it off

314
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,068
with like a spice to get things hot!

315
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:27,901
- Yeah, alright.

316
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,303
- So let's add our wasabi. So I'm gonna take a chopstick,

317
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,464
put it in a little bit, and then-

318
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:34,381
- What? Oh!

319
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:38,353
- It's a wasabi chopstick!

320
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:41,764
I will eat my sushi with a wasabi chopstick!

321
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:44,871
- No way! Oh man, that's so gross!

322
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:46,416
- Not happy about this!

323
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,750
- Mine's not even gonna roll! It just falls out!

324
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,668
- Okay here we go. We're gonna turn this around.

325
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,133
I think this can work as a strainer,

326
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,104
because I can actually strain out all the ketchup.

327
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:57,637
Oh no! Here we go, just strain out the ketchup.

328
00:09:57,637 --> 00:09:59,630
- Oh no. What are you doing?

329
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,532
- I'm actually packing it in tight.

330
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,217
Look at this! It worked!

331
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:04,986
- But you lost everything in the middle.

332
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:05,819
- Not everything.

333
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:06,652
- Yeah.

334
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:08,887
- I'm creating a sushi ball. The first of its kind.

335
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,085
- Aw, that doesn't sit well.

336
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:12,137
Alright, well, mine's just gonna be a hand roll.

337
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:15,223
There we go! Bam! Rice ball! It worked.

338
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:18,079
- I mean it is a ball, yeah, but it's not a sushi roll.

339
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,254
- I got my rice ball, Devin's got his-

340
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,407
- Hand roll! My hand roll.

341
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:25,386
- You get to comment down below who won this round!

342
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:27,052
We'll be eating these at the end of the video.

343
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:28,953
Right now, it's on to the next round.

344
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:30,820
This round, you challenged us to make mystery pasta,

345
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,692
so right now let's spin for our first ingredient.

346
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:35,962
Here we go, 3, 2, 1, you went a little bit early again.

347
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:37,263
- You know what? I have to,

348
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:38,577
it's part of the good luck, man!

349
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:39,918
- I'm gonna predict it's gonna land on purple.

350
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,510
- And I'm doing blue. Oh! So close.

351
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,580
- Alright well let's see what our first ingredient is:

352
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,289
cottage cheese. Is that normal, or? I don't think-

353
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:50,048
- Well, it's cheese, so I guess it works.

354
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,368
- Yeah, cheese and pasta kind of goes together.

355
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:52,230
So what did you get?

356
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,063
- Alfredo sauce.

357
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:55,786
- Well, that's perfect. Ew! That's not

358
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:57,522
the type of cheese you put on pasta!

359
00:10:57,522 --> 00:11:00,498
- Oh! This is gonna be some good pasta!

360
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:01,743
- Dude, it smells.

361
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:02,745
- Oh yeah.

362
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,320
- Alright. I'm just gonna add it in. It's so chunky.

363
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,570
- Dude. Oh man.

364
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:11,303
- Time for the spin. Here we go: 3, 2, 1. Oh!

365
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,412
- Alright. Got it.

366
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:13,915
- What is this? Truffles?

367
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:15,196
- I don't know if that's too bad. Right?

368
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,337
- I think that's good. I know there's

369
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:17,923
a certain type of truffles that's really expensive

370
00:11:17,923 --> 00:11:19,495
when they add it to dishes and stuff.

371
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:21,451
- Whoa, no! I got clams!

372
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:22,934
- People have pasta with clams.

373
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,329
- I don't know if I've ever had that though.

374
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:26,889
- Wait a second! Chocolate truffles?

375
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,941
- This looks so gross! Ugh! Alright, well, here we go.

376
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,749
Oh, it's just the water.

377
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:35,425
- Last truffle. This is called off-the-nose trick shot.

378
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:36,258
- Do you see this?

379
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:37,436
- I'm trying to do a trick shot.

380
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:40,072
- Really? It looks like you're having so much fun-

381
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:42,916
- Oh my gosh, that looks so disgusting!

382
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,610
- It smells even worse.

383
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,736
- These pastas are coming along weird.

384
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:48,819
Like real weird. 3, 2, 1.

385
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:52,211
- Yours actually isn't looking too bad.

386
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,120
- No! What? What?

387
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,034
- You go first.

388
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:58,446
- I got Parmesan cheese. Oh that's so bad.

389
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:02,329
- Sardines! That's gonna be terrible!

390
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:05,298
- This is so good, I'm gonna add it all.

391
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:06,436
- That's quite overpowering,

392
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:08,376
what you got going on there, Devin.

393
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:10,110
- Ew! Sardine juice is all over, here we go.

394
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,193
Oh gosh. Oh gosh. Oh gosh. Oh no! Ew!

395
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,038
- Oh, dude. You got little bones sticking out of it.

396
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:19,556
- 3, 2, 1! Let's see what we got.

397
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:21,407
- Oh! I got M&M'S!

398
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,240
- I got olives.

399
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,675
- I need to add all of these to counteract this.

400
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:26,051
- At least you have a sauce. I have no sauce.

401
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:27,514
Like cottage cheese is the closest thing

402
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,344
I have to a sauce. You guys can comment down below:

403
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:31,133
who do you think won this round?

404
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,224
We'll be eating these at the end,

405
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:34,195
but right now, it's on to the next one.

406
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:37,843
Taco time! You challenged us to make "mystery tacos."

407
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:39,123
in 3, -

408
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:39,956
- I already spun!

409
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:42,249
- Here we go. I think it's going to be green.

410
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:45,499
- Blue. Oh! No! I got hot peppers, bro.

411
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:48,025
- I got marshmallow fluff.

412
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,070
I don't know if that's good or bad.

413
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,903
- That's great!

414
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,934
- Imagine this is just sour cream.

415
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:55,104
There we go, nice. No! It just split my taco-

416
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:56,619
- What are you doing?

417
00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:00,585
- 3, 2, 1. No look spin. Oh! I got jelly beans!

418
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:03,722
- I got seaweed. This is like seaweed,

419
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:06,239
some other kind of seaweed, and a ton of salt.

420
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,167
- You gotta be very sparing with

421
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,291
how you add your jelly beans.

422
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,152
- Dude, smell this. You have to smell this.

423
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:13,474
- If you took your head, stuck it in a coral reef,

424
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:14,939
and just went (sniffing)-

425
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:16,394
- I found a hair in mine.

426
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:18,486
And it has a piece of salt on it, too.

427
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:19,319
- 3, 2, 1.

428
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,249
- I actually waited for you this time.

429
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:22,204
You proud of me?

430
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:23,931
- I'm proud of you, Devin. I got red.

431
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:27,157
- I got red, too. Dude, I got oysters!

432
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:30,240
- No! I got switch! I'm so not happy!

433
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:36,835
- Dude! I'm so excited! That's yours and this is mine.

434
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:37,964
- On the bright side, though,

435
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:38,937
you have to actually ruin it because

436
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:42,524
you have to add your oysters to it. Ew! Those fancy!

437
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:45,396
- I need this. It's literally stuck!

438
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:48,896
- Oh my gosh! Ah! Geeze! Final ingredient!

439
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:52,804
Here we go! 3, 2, 1! Oh man, I hope it's good!

440
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:53,707
Okay let's see here.

441
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,764
- Oh, alright.

442
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:55,597
- No!

443
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:57,519
- Yes! I got maple syrup!

444
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,160
- I got toxic waste! Oh no! I'm using it as a garnish,

445
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,290
like as a little finishing for the top of the taco.

446
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,746
- Mine's like a soup now. Here we go, the tacos are done.

447
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,753
I am so not looking forward to these tacos whatsoever!

448
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:11,757
- That's so bad.

449
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:15,007
- Alright, here we go. 3, 2, 1. Oh! Oh!

450
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:21,141
(mumbling)

451
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:25,943
- This smells so bad. I'm just gonna go for it. 3, 2, 1-

452
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:27,313
- Wait, first three second challenge!

453
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:28,836
We want to see if you can like this video

454
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:30,819
in three seconds. Are you ready? Here we go!

455
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,152
- 3, 2, 1, done!

456
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,449
- Oh! This tastes so bad!

457
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:39,117
- Cakes are out of the oven, so now it's time

458
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:41,697
to get them out of these plate things.

459
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,280
- Oh man! Oh, it smells so bad!

460
00:14:46,742 --> 00:14:48,948
- You're breaking my cake! There we go.

461
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:51,426
- Your cake looks so good. I bet it smells-

462
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:52,388
- Ugh!

463
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:53,221
- What? What?

464
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:55,031
- At the bottom of it was like this huge wiff

465
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:57,281
of jalapenos! Ugh my spoon!

466
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:01,116
- Did you get some jalapeno in there, though?

467
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,892
- None. Alright, bro just take a bite of it.

468
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:03,989
- 3, 2, 1.

469
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:05,777
- You took a bite of the onion, bro!

470
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:10,238
- (Coughs) that was the worst thing I've ever tasted!

471
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:12,096
- Dude, your breath is so bad right now.

472
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:15,327
This is the one I'm not looking forward to, man.

473
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:18,660
- At least mine have M&M'S. 3, 2, 1. Oh.

474
00:15:19,645 --> 00:15:20,478
- Is it bad?

475
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:21,311
- Yeah. Yeah.

476
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:24,515
- I don't know how excited I am to eat this pasta!

477
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:25,755
- I'll get an olive, and I also want to get

478
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:27,968
one truffle in there, and a whole bunch of cottage cheese.

479
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,795
Oh wait, I forgot the best ingredient!

480
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,371
I forgot to grab an anchovy. 3, 2, 1.

481
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:34,234
- Dude, is it that bad?

482
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,496
- It's so many things at once!

483
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:38,117
Oh my gosh! Because of the chocolate, you're like,

484
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:40,088
"Yeah, this is good." And then you have an olive

485
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:42,140
with the chocolate, like, "this is weird!"

486
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,588
and then the cottage cheese and the sardine

487
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:45,541
is what really just- oh my gosh!

488
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:49,107
I got my wasabi chopsticks and it's time to eat these-

489
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:52,274
- You put a hole in mine! 3, 2, 1. Oh!

490
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:57,674
(mumbling)

491
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,733
- Well that was effective.

492
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:04,092
- I want to take a bite of the whole thing.

493
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:06,071
- Ooh! What? What? What?

494
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:06,904
- Okay, it's not bad.

495
00:16:06,904 --> 00:16:08,606
Comment down below: what are some other foods

496
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:10,548
