1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,032
- What's up?

2
00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:01,865
It's Collins Key.

3
00:00:01,865 --> 00:00:03,159
Now I sent Devon on a shopping spree,

4
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:04,343
so I'm gonna make him appear right now.

5
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:05,669
He's got some really cool stuff.

6
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:06,979
Let's try this.

7
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:07,812
Hey! - Hey!

8
00:00:07,812 --> 00:00:08,645
- Welcome back, bro.

9
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:11,155
Dude, you got some Kylie stuff, yay!

10
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:12,539
So today Devon and I are going to be trying

11
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,621
out a whole bunch of viral Instagram products.

12
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:17,758
You guys know Kylie Jenner Lip Kits blew up.

13
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:19,644
A whole bunch of other stuff, we got Unicorn Tears.

14
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,484
I don't even know.

15
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:22,581
I'm sorry, Devon, here you go.

16
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:25,374
So we also did a magnetic face mask.

17
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:26,790
Which, basically, you put a face mask on,

18
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,566
use a magnet to take it all off.

19
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,599
If you want to see that video,

20
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,199
we had a horrible reaction to it.

21
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,694
It went terribly wrong.

22
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:34,151
That video is on my Instagram.

23
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,652
The direct link to it is down in the description below.

24
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:38,238
And if you give that Instagram video a like

25
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,846
and you comment it on keyper squad, I'll be going through

26
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:41,370
DMing you guys, liking your photos,

27
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,120
and replying to you guys on Instagram.

28
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,350
So, go do that right now.

29
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,784
The link is down in the description.

30
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:47,270
If you want Devon and I to do another video

31
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,953
where we try out even more girl products,

32
00:00:48,953 --> 00:00:50,857
let us know by liking this video.

33
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:53,743
If this video gets enough thumbs up, we will do another one.

34
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:56,332
And also comment down below, what's a crazy girl product

36

I'm also giving away a drone on YouTube,

37
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:02,128
an iPhone seven on my Instagram, a GoPro on my Twitter.

38
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,565
All the rules for this giveaway are down

39
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:04,911

All of his links are down in the description below.

42
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:10,037
Without any further ado, let's jump right in right now.

43
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,399
I think we're gonna kick it off with a Kylie Lip Kit.

44
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:13,332
Let's do it.

45
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:14,490
To kick things off we're starting off

46
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,778
with Kylie Jenner Lip Kits.

47
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:18,553
We're going with the two most popular flavor,

48
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:19,627
no, what are they called?

49
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:20,945
Colors?

50
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:21,786
- Yeah, colors.

51
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:23,017
- I don't know what it is. - I don't know.

52
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:23,911
- I have Candy K.

53
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:24,994
- I have Coco K.

54
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:26,324
- So we're going to apply these first

55
00:01:26,324 --> 00:01:28,416
and then we're gonna continue on with the rest of our look

56
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:31,749
and our quest for viral Instagram looks?

57
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,467
I don't know. - I don't know.

58
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:34,408
- Let's just get into this.

59
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:35,241
- Alright.

60
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:37,284
So, we've got, wait, there's two things in here.

61
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:38,516
- What are these? - There's this stuff,

62
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:39,452
and then this thingy.

63
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:40,381
What's the difference?

64
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:41,931
- It's like a pen.

65
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:44,636
- So, one's a lip liner, and then one is a lipstick.

66
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:46,117
A matte, liquid lipstick.

67
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:47,220
What do you use a lip liner for?

68
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,053
- I don't know.

69
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:49,547
I guess you'd put lines on your lips?

70
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:50,380
I don't know.

71
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,283
- Okay, so like accentuate.

72
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:52,590
- Oh like that.

73
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,423
- The circumference of your lips, I guess.

74
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:54,256
- I guess.

75
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:55,089
Alright.

76
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:55,922
- I feel like we need a mirror for this.

77
00:01:55,922 --> 00:01:56,755
- No, we'll just do it on each other.

78
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:58,317
- Alright, so I guess we're gonna do this on each other

79
00:01:58,317 --> 00:01:59,351
because, why not?

80
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:00,430
Okay, you ready?

81
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,263
Does it smell good?

82
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:02,096
- Yes.

83
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:03,373
- Oh my gosh, it really does.

84
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,805
Mine smells good, dude, smell mine!

85
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:07,141
- Whoa, they smell different, too.

86
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:07,974
- Oh, these are delicious.

87
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:09,161
Do I want top lip or bottom lip?

88
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:10,246
- I'm going for bottom first.

89
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:11,956
- I don't like it.

90
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:12,789
I don't like it.

91
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:13,622
I don't like it.

92
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:14,455
- These are very thick.

93
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:15,288
- I don't like it.

94
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:16,121
It's like peanut butter going on my lip.

95
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:16,954
- Really?

96
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:17,878
- Yeah, with like a wet sponge putting it on.

97
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:18,711
- We gotta complete it.

98
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:19,544
We gotta complete it.

99
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:21,461
- Ugh, I don't like it.

100
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:25,849
You stop.

101
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:26,682
You stop.

102
00:02:26,682 --> 00:02:27,515
You stop.

103
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:28,348
I'm gonna do it on you.

104
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,181
- It looks like the same.

105
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:30,014
It looks like your normal lips.

106
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:30,847
- Alright open up your.

107
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:32,467
- Okay.

108
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,155
- You can't smile.

109
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,212
How am I supposed to apply it when you smile?

110
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:37,459
You can see how weird this feels.

111
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:38,292
- Ugh.

112
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,125
- See?

113
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:39,958
- Ugh.

114
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:40,791
Ugh.

115
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,624
- Ew!

116
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:42,457
Bro, I feel like Kylie Jenner right now.

117
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:44,465
She's good at makeup and so am I.

118
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:45,298
(laughs)

119
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,779
I got it on the edge of his mouth.

120
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,003
I have an idea.

121
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,681
I'm not gonna pull the Kylie.

122
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:53,643
Look forward.

123
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:54,476
Look forward.

124
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:55,309
Look forward.

125
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,142
- No!

126
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:00,650
- My lines are terrible.

127
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,163
I never knew how difficult it was to make your lips

128
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:05,498
look convincingly bigger.

129
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:07,563
- You have no care to this.

130
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,552
- I'm trying bro.

131
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:11,877
- These are my lips, not your lips.

132
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:12,710
- Oops.

133
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,423
- Ready?

134
00:03:16,423 --> 00:03:17,256
Ready?

135
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:18,756
- I don't like it.

136
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,334
- This is great.

137
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,167
- Yeah.

138
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,006
- I can't really see what I'm doing on that side,

139
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:24,839
but I'm sure it's great.

140
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,244
- You're like actually making me sick.

141
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:29,327
(laughs)

142
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:33,954
You look like the Joker.

143
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:35,885
- I'm gonna go for some super voluptuous.

144
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:36,718
- No!

145
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:38,480
We're supposed to actually be trying this stuff.

146
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,719
Not like, no!

147
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,960
- It looks amazing.

148
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,793
- Are you done?

149
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:42,626
- I'm done.

150
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:44,026
- Great, I'm crying dude.

151
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:45,019
My eyes are like sweaty.

152
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,108
I like, licked my lips.

153
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:47,485
- Yeah.

154
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,830
- Never doing that again.

155
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,277
You're like eating her lipstick, bro.

156
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:52,110
That's disgusting.

157
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,943
Alright, so Devon's putting on the

158
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:58,432
Huda Beauty eyelash extension.

159
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:00,701
I want the nails.

160
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:01,915
Bro, I do not wanna put these eyelashes on.

161
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:02,812
- I got the nails.

162
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:03,875
- No!

163
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,901
This looks like a nest of feathers, guys.

164
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:08,582
Like this isn't eyelashes, this is just so much more.

165
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,504
- Gotta figure out how to apply these nails on myself.

166
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:12,248
It comes with a mini nail file.

167
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:13,551
- I am so not happy about this.

168
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:14,422
This is gonna be horrible.

169
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:18,312
The whole video, I'm gonna look like an absolute fool.

170
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:20,326
I'm gonna channel my inner feelings right now

171
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,072
on this Ho, Hoda, Hoda, Huda Beauty.

172
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:26,543
The weak E because I'm feeling weak at the moment.

173
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:28,418
- It came with a little case.

174
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,287
It says, no matter how you feel,

175
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:32,097
dress up, and never give up.

176
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:33,376
That's right Collins, never give up.

177
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:35,568
Is this going to be stuck to my nails permanently?

178
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,216
- Yes, Devon, these are literally going to be

179
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:38,545
stuck to your nails for the rest of your life.

180
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,150
Oh my God, these are rather grippy.

181
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,511
Alright, I'm gonna need you to try this on my eyelash.

182
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:43,645
- Where's the glue for it?

183
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:44,478
- It's already on there.

184
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,350
- Already glue on there?

185
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,011
- Devon, this is Stella eight, bro.

186
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:48,553
This isn't Stella seven, or Stella six.

187
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:49,386
- Excuse me.

188
00:04:49,386 --> 00:04:50,737
- Make it look good.

189
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:51,870
If you're gonna do it, just make it look good.

190
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,370
I'm so not excited about this.

191
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:56,641
I can feel it.

192
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:58,323
It's like a wing on my eye.

193
00:04:58,323 --> 00:04:59,403
- You can fly away with those.

194
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:01,640
- Alright, we got the second one here.

195
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,514
- I think we did these backwards.

196
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:04,362
- What do you mean backwards?

197
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:07,674
- The longer part of the lash is in.

198
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,283
- I can feel it like hitting my brow.

199
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:11,137
Do girls like trim these fake eyelashes?

200
00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:12,826
Because I feel like they're a little bit much.

201
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:14,405
From my vision right now, it feels like

202
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:16,493
I have really large eyebrows.

203
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:18,196
Like encroaching down on my eyes.

204
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:21,220
- Okay, so apparently these are all-in-one,

205
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,252
pop-on manicure kit.

206
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:24,860
24 nails.

207
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,693
- 24 nails?

208
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,610
I only have 23 fingers.

209
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:31,600
Just, can go.

210
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,186
So, apparently these are holographic nails.

211
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:35,442
I wanna see Obi-Wan Kenobi in this.

212
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:36,275
- I know.

213
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:37,210
I wanna see holograms

214
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,978
pop out of these nails, you know?

215
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:39,811
Wow.

216
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:42,736
That is never fitting on any one of my fingers.

217
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:43,569
- Oh my gosh.

218
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:44,402
That's tiny.

219
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:45,907
- I think the one for the thumb is probably gonna work

220
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:47,489
for my pinky finger.

221
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:48,992
How do you put these on?

222
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:51,187
- Dude, you're asking a man with fake eyelashes on, okay

223
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:52,457
You need glue first.

224
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:53,490
- Hold, hold, hold on.

225
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,873
I think it's supposed to be this side.

226
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:56,033
Yeah, go for it.

227
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,721
No, that's too much, too much, too much.

228
00:05:57,721 --> 00:05:59,424
- I wanna make sure it stays.

229
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:00,257
- I don't.

230
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:03,110
This better not be permanent.

231
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,943
- These we go.

232
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:05,240
Devon has a holographic nail.

233
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,663
- It feels very stuck.

234
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,654
It's not coming off.

235
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:09,778
I feel there's no hope.

236
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:11,313
I'm applying force.

237
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:12,729
- At least I can take these fake eyelashes off.

238
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:13,593
You can't take that off.

239
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,556
Alright, now to the next Kylie Jenner Lip Kit.

240
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:16,746
So, we are going to remove.

241
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:17,957
Ew, I touched my lip.

242
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:18,876
Oh!

243
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,786
Why am I cut?

244
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:21,619
- What?

245
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:23,253
- That's what happens man, this look is just so sharp,

246
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:24,438
you happen to cut yourself.

247
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:25,271
How did it cut my finger?

248
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:26,647
Now one of my favorite things on the inside

249
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:27,950
of this holographic nail box,

250
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,225
is don't follow trends, create them.

251
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:32,512
The issue is, this is a trend so.

252
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:34,730
I don't know if you guys can tell,

253
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,513
but like my lips and this area of my face

254
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:37,522
are very red right now.

255
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,986
Because I tried my mom's makeup wipe remover things,

256
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:41,251
and I had a bad reaction to it.

257
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:43,719
And, like, it stings. This whole part of my face stings.

258
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:44,839
So, moving onto the next one,

259
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,470
and this is a metallic lipstick.

260
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,303
- What's yours called?

261
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,136
- Mine is called Heir.

262
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:48,969
- Heir?

263
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:49,802
- Heir. - Mine is called Reign.

264
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:50,635
- Did I read that?

265
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:51,468
Is that hair?

266
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:52,301
(buzzer sounds)

267
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:53,134
So, apparently, this is heir.

268
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:54,111
Not like the wind,

269
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,778
but like the heir to the throne.

270
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:03,621
Devon, just because I made it look easy,

271
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,717
doesn't mean it's necessarily easy.

272
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,470
- Oh this one smells good, too.

273
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,437
- Oh, it does.

274
00:07:09,437 --> 00:07:11,288
Kinda of like mm with your lips.

275
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:14,724
Oh, nope, now just kind of slightly open your mouth.

276
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,158
Yo, this one actually looks pretty bomb.

277
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:17,143
- Well, don't over do it.

278
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:18,251
- I'm not over doing it, I'm just making sure

279
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,084
it looks good.

280
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:19,917
- It feels weird.

281
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:20,765
- It look really cool.

282
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:22,956
But I do need to add more voluptuousness on the top.

283
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:23,789
Open up.

284
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:24,622
Yep.

285
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:26,358
I promise it'll look good.

286
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:27,191
- I don't trust you.

287
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:28,024
- Open up your mouth.

288
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:28,987
- Oh no.

289
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:29,950
I'm scared.

290
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,783
- Oh no.

291
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,616
Oh no.

292
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:32,449
- Look right here.

293
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:33,282
That doesn't look too bad.

294
00:07:33,282 --> 00:07:34,189
- I feel the mistakes.

295
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,312
- There's your Heir, Devon.

296
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:36,145
- All right.

297
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:36,978
Your turn.

298
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:39,604
Come on, dude it's not that bad.

299
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:40,437
- I hate it.

300
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:41,314
I hate it so much.

301
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:42,447
- It's not that bad.

302
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:43,916
Oh, this does look cool.

303
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,559
I kinda messed up, but it looks good.

304
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,793
- Don't get it on the inside of my mouth.

305
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:49,633
- It's not on the inside.

306
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:50,466
- Yes it is.

307
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:51,817
- Whoa, hey.

308
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:53,287
- Are you supposed to swallow when you put on lipstick,

309
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:54,714
or are you supposed to keep your mouth dry?

310
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:55,547
- I don't know.

311
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:56,380
Don't talk.

312
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,639
- Okay.

313
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,472
- Alright.

314
00:07:58,472 --> 00:07:59,366
- Sa dude!

315
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:00,199
Sa dude!

316
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,189
Sa Dude!

317
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,884
Alright, next product.

318
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:04,068
Let's go.

319
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:05,404
So, this next one, we've got a twofer.

320
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,276
Ow.

321
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:08,609
This is Becca Champagne Pop.

322
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,383
Why is there no one ever in a video that's read them

323
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:13,750
off in that way?

324
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,119
Like, this one's Becca by Jaclyn Hill Champagne Pop.

325
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:18,505
Becca Pop!

326
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:19,338
Champagne Pop!

327
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:21,457
- This is a contour stick, apparently.

328
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,733
I'm gonna pop it off.

329
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:24,566
Whoa.

330
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:25,399
This is uh.

331
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,232
- Whoa.

332
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:27,450
- Alright, Collins, it is time.

333
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,837
Alright, Collins, it is time.

334
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:29,691
- No!

335
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:30,524
- Alright, ready?

336
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:31,357
- Yep.

337
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:33,422
- Okay, I'm guessing that this goes here.

338
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:34,558
- Wait!

339
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:35,391
- Nailed it.

340
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,516
And then maybe just one down the nose.

341
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,019
Oh yeah, perfect.

342
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:39,852
- Great.

343
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,918
- Oooh.

344
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:41,751
Killin' it.

345
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:42,781
I don't know if they're supposed to go like that,

346
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:43,678
or like that.

347
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:44,581
Maybe I'll try one more.

348
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:46,206
- I like it how it is Devon.

349
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,447
- I need to do the other side of the nose.

350
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:49,280
- Even me out.

351
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,113
Make me symmetrical.

352
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:50,946
I heard symmetrical is beautiful.

353
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,573
What?

354
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,555
- And then, forehead contours.

355
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:55,644
- There's no such thing as a forehead contour.

356
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:56,548
- Jaw contours.

357
00:08:56,548 --> 00:08:58,124
- There's no jaw contours!

358
00:08:58,124 --> 00:08:58,957
Ow.

359
00:08:58,957 --> 00:08:59,790
Do I have a jawline now?

360
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,623
You gonna do my other side?

361
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,456
- No.

362
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:02,698
- This is my good side.

363
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:04,050
Alright, so it's my turn to contour you.

364
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:04,883
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

365
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:06,883
You're using that thing.

366
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,454
From the ear?

367
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:11,602
Dude, I actually tried.

368
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:12,439
- I did, too.

369
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:13,935
- I actually tried.

370
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:16,031
- You gotta make sure the cheekbone goes from the ear

371
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,903
to the front.

372
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:18,296
Stop smiling, it's messing up your contour.

373
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:21,568
Your nose looks crooked now because of what I just did.

374
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:22,567
- Oh great.

375
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:26,330
- And, I need to do the jawline contour.

376
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,762
It looks like neck hair.

377
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:29,595
Like a neck beard.

378
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,877
What better to compliment a contouring session

379
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:32,994
than an eyelining session?

380
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:33,827
Where is my brush?

381
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:34,660
- You yeeded the brush.

382
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,493
- No, I didn't.

383
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,326
It fell off my thing.

384
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,159
- No, you threw it.

385
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,992
- No!

386
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:38,825
Ready?

387
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:39,658
- Okay.

388
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:40,491
That's a lot bro.

389
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:42,163
- I think that's how you do it.

390
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:43,051
- What is this?

391
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:44,259
No, feels so wrong.

392
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,092
- There we go.

393
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:45,925
Perfect.

394
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:47,428
And, then I think people highlight the chin

395
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:49,379
and the bridge of the nose, the tip of the nose.

396
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,362
- The tip of the nose?

397
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:53,507
- I'm gonna use my tap out right now.

398
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:54,340
- What?

399
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,173
That was never set up.

400
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:56,006
- It's a new rule.

401
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:56,979
We each have one tap out product,

402
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:57,972
where we don't have to use it.

403
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,179
- I would have tapped out already.

404
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:00,996
- But that means I have to use one extreme product

405
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,402
at the end of this.

406
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,322
- How do I look?

407
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:04,155
- Uh huh.

408
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:05,259
The looks are coming together nicely.

409
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,353
We just need one more thing,

410
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:08,377
which is our final Lip Kit from Kylie.

411
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,225
We've got one more product to add after this,

412
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:11,769
but I got Skylie.

413
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:12,602
- Skylie?

414
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:13,435
- Skylie.

415
00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:14,268
That's embarrassing.

416
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:15,910
- I got Mary Jo K.

417
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,398
- Devon, open.

418
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:18,708
Yeah, this is pretty aggressive.

419
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,853
It looks like you've been standing outside

420
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:23,668
for hours, and you are just extremely cold.

421
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:24,956
Just looks funny, bro.

422
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:25,789
- Really?

423
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:26,622
- Yep.

424
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:27,455
Alright now my turn.

425
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,947
Give me some red lips.

426
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:33,120
Whatever this brush is, I don't like it touching my lips.

427
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,968
- Don't move away, dude.

428
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:34,801
You're messing it up.

429
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,634
- It's sickening.

430
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:36,467
- You're messing it up.

431
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:37,847
It kinda looks like blood.

432
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:38,680
- Huh?

433
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,513
- Bro, you need to stop moving.

434
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,176
- This sucks dude!

435
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:42,009
(crickets chirp)

436
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:42,965
Ta-da!

437
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:45,548
Yeah, looking very festive, Devon.

438
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:46,381
- Woo woo.

439
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:47,516
- There we go, the final Kylie Lip Kit.

440
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,091
Definitely the most aggressive colors

441
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:50,540
she must have in her line.

442
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,836
Devon, you look like an alien, bro.

443
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:54,403
Alright guys, now we are moving onto the final step

444
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,591
to complete this look,

445
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,205
so let's do it.

446
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:58,507
- Okay, so for this last one,

447
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,254
since Collins used his tap out.

448
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:04,171
I get to put this, Unicorn Tears, all over you.

449
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:08,013
I guess it's a lipstick, but people just put it everywhere.

450
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:09,083
So, that's what I'm gonna do.

451
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,018
- It's blue though.

452
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:12,077
- Hey, I'm gonna do some up there real quick.

453
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:12,910
- On my eyebrow?

454
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,369
No.

455
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:15,297
- Whoa.

456
00:11:15,297 --> 00:11:16,130
- What?

457
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:16,963
- [Devon] That looks awesome.

458
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:17,796
- It looks good?

459
00:11:17,796 --> 00:11:19,030
- It looks crazy.

460
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,284
- Am I gonna be able to get this stuff off?

461
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:22,134
It's a lipstick, it probably won't come off my eye.

462
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:24,879
- It'll come off your eye, Collins.

463
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,712
That's legit.

464
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,592
That actually looks very beautiful.

465
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:28,457
Wow.

466
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:30,452
Put some on the philtrum.

467
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:31,285
Whoa.

468
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:32,776
- Always need that philtrum highlight.

469
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,251
- Tip of the nose since you did mine,

470
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:35,643
and let's just get this highlight, too.

471
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,513
And, let's get the nice T shape in there.

472
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:38,619
- There's no T, ow.

473
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:40,452
R.I.P. to my eyebrows.

474
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:44,520
- That looks crazy.

475
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,346
Gotta do some on the cheeks, too.

476
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,904
Gonna go for three dots now.

477
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:48,737
- Why?

478
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,545
- Because I thought it would look cool.

479
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:51,762
Oh yeah, it does look awesome.

480
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,274
That looks cool.

481
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:56,977
- I'm sure I look beautiful at the moment.

482
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,345
I'm calling it quits right now.

483
00:11:58,345 --> 00:11:59,642
You've gone way too far with this.

484
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:00,889
If you guys wanna see the video

485
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:04,394

and a lot of you guys know,

492
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,832
I worked with AT&T Hello Lab to make the series,

493
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:16,736
The Disappearing Girl.

494
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,900
If you guys wanna check that out, the link is down below.

495
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,364
They also partnered up with friends of mine

496
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,397
Hasta Duo, to make public record.

497
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:24,421
Where basically they took a whole bunch of fan stories

498
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:26,316
and they compiled it into an EP,

499
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:28,293
and it is absolutely beautiful.

500
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:30,244
Now Hasta Duo, they're a couple, they blew up on Vine.

501
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:31,468
So talented.

502
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:32,612

(snaps)
