1
00:00:00,894 --> 00:00:02,308
(screaming)

2
00:00:02,308 --> 00:00:04,011
- You challenged us to combine Skittles

3
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:05,981
with crazy hot Sriracha sauce

4
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:07,388
and let's see how this taste.

5
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:08,221
Woo hoo!

6
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:09,925
- [Both] Oh!

7
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:11,382
- Yo that's not even enough bro.

8
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:13,667
I can already smell the spice but we're going crazy.

9
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,692
(screaming)

10
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:17,535
All right spoons in let's mix it up.

11
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:18,368
Oh no.

12
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:22,123
- I smelled lovely Skittles and now I smell

13
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,924
Sriracha sauce.

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,606
- [Blonde] I think we put way too much Sriracha sauce bro.

15
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:27,286
- You put way too much Sriracha sauce.

16
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:28,595
I had nothing to do with it.

17
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,428
- It's all Sriracha sauce.

18
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:31,235
The weirdest thing bro is that number one

19
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:33,086
it looks like a disgusting chili,

20
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:35,631
and number two all the food coloring has come off

21
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:36,487
of the Skittles.

22
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:37,918
- So there's just weird white.

23
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:39,066
- [Brunette] They look like beans bro.

24
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:40,007
- Yeah they look like little beans.

25
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,254
- Bean beans beans.

26
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:42,733
Can I get a big spoonful right here.

27
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:43,632
Oh no.

28
00:00:43,632 --> 00:00:44,682
And we are trying a whole bunch

29
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:47,184
of weird food combinations that people love.

30
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:49,273
This is the Halloween slash Fall edition

31
00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:50,506
and after this one I might not

32
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:51,896
be able to taste anything else.

33
00:00:51,896 --> 00:00:53,229
Three, two, one.

34
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:56,529
- [Both] Oh!

35
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:58,092
- Oh my god. - Oh.

36
00:00:58,092 --> 00:00:59,092
- [Both] Oh.

37
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:01,541
- God they're like spicy.

38
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,967
(mumbling)

39
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:04,832
Wait. - What?

40
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:05,693
- Oh my god.

41
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:07,700
Dude when the Skittles kick in.

42
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,501
It's a burst of flavors.

43
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:10,334
- Wait really?

44
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:11,808
- Yeah! - Haven't happened to me yet.

45
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:12,681
- Here's the thing, this right here is

46
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,464
the bowl of doom.

47
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:16,549
After each round we are adding some of the food

48
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,090
into the bowl of doom and at the end of this

49
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,727
we are going to have to eat a combination

50
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:22,860
of all the weird foods which is literally going

51
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,406
to be the weirdest food combination of all time.

52
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:26,668
Sorry that's enough that's enough.

53
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:28,354
We set it off over here to the side

54
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,546
and right it's on to the next round.

55
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,019
You may have heard of the weird food combination

56
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:33,143
where you dip a french fry in a milkshake.

57
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:35,106
Well today we're taking it to the next level.

58
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:37,931
We're doing the fall edition and upping the ante

59
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,852
'cause we're actually adding the french fries

60
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:41,817
into the milkshake.

61
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:42,881
- Wait what? - Let's go.

62
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:43,949
- Ugh. - Yayt.

63
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:46,443
Yeah we need this, yayt.

64
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:47,276
- What?

65
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:48,521
Dude where did the lid go?

66
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:49,354
Oh I've got it.

67
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:51,342
Dude you heeded too soon you can't do this.

68
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:52,209
You needed this.

69
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,638
Bro we have to do this other way around.

70
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:56,032
- Oh okay.

71
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:56,865
How we going to do this,

72
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:57,698
first we're going to make the milkshake,

73
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:58,821
dump a french fry into it.

74
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:00,088
Num num num see how it tastes.

75
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:01,530
Second step then we're actually going to add

76
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,334
the french fries in, blend it all around

77
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:04,192
then dab dab.

78
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,025
- Milk. - Let's make

79
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,192
the milkshake.

80
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:07,889
- Dude why?

81
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:08,918
Dude.

82
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:09,863
- I got thirsty.

83
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,955
- Sometimes I just, I don't understand.

84
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,591
- Oh hot sauce on my lips.

85
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,925
My lips need to be cleansed.

86
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:17,175
- No no no, no.

87
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:19,949
I saved the fries. - All right we're clean.

88
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:20,782
Yayt. - No.

89
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,746
I held onto 'em.

90
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:23,729
- I tried to eat 'em for you.

91
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:24,590
- No. - You should eat 'em

92
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,423
Devin it feels good.

93
00:02:25,423 --> 00:02:26,648
- Calm down.

94
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:27,589
- Eating, eating.

95
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:29,148
- Settle down you eat monster.

96
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,461
- Eating is good for the soul.

97
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:31,294
- Is it?

98
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:32,751
All right we're going to add this milk in here.

99
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:33,584
- Yep and then next step we got

100
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:35,132
to add the ice cream.

101
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:37,182
- Dude how did I get milk on me?

102
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:38,015
- I don't know.

103
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:38,848
(screaming)

104
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:40,048
What is this?

105
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:41,778
- What? - Oh my gosh.

106
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:43,361
It's Snickerdoodle.

107
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,071
- We were going to use that spoon.

108
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:49,968
I'm just waiting for the brain freeze to kick it.

109
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:50,909
- Ow ow.

110
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:51,742
So I think we need some more ice cream.

111
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,333
No spoon this time, just my hands

112
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,086
- Splash guard, splash guard, oh my god.

113
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:57,059
- Oh. - Uh oh that was nice work.

114
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:57,958
And then we blend it.

115
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,895
- Yep. - With

116
00:02:58,895 --> 00:02:59,728
that button.

117
00:02:59,728 --> 00:03:00,774
(grinding)

118
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,499
- I never made a milkshake before today.

119
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,521
It's exciting for me.

120
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:04,629
(grinding)

121
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:06,182
- I think we broke our last blender.

122
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:07,015
- Yeah.

123
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,760
Oh my god mine's actually smoking out the back.

124
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,947
Can you see the smoke coming out of mine?

125
00:03:09,947 --> 00:03:11,585
- I can see it and I can smell it.

126
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:12,645
And now I have a new one

127
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:14,696
but it's the same problem.

128
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,375
- [Commentator] 20 minutes later.

129
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,398
(grinding)

130
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,545
Eventually.

131
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:21,100
- All right well seems to be good.

132
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,965
How's that ice cream?

133
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:22,798
- Oh dude.

134
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:23,632
I'm making sure that the ice cream is of

135
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:24,583
the quality we need.

136
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,416
All right gah.

137
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,758
- No, why?

138
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:27,786
- I didn't mean to do that.

139
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:29,261
- All right we're gonna need a big spoon

140
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:30,363
to mix this up.

141
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:31,196
- I got chu.

142
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:32,037
- That's a teeny spoon.

143
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:33,442
How do we know.

144
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:34,342
All right ready.

145
00:03:34,342 --> 00:03:35,412
(grinding)

146
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:36,757
Oh that didn't even do anything.

147
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,149
(grinding)

148
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:39,373
(screaming)

149
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:41,008
- Oh my gosh sorry the tip of the blade

150
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:42,115
hit the tip of my spoon.

151
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:43,837
- Oh no. - Oh it's working.

152
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:45,186
- Is it? - I think so.

153
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:46,019
- [Devin] Nice.

154
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:46,852
- I can't tell.

155
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,761
(screaming)

156
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:48,594
Sorry.

157
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:49,857
(screaming)

158
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:50,690
- It work. - Working.

159
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,607
- All right we're good.

160
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:55,721
(lips smacking)

161
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:57,072
Wow after that raving review

162
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:58,015
I can't wait to try it.

163
00:03:58,015 --> 00:03:58,848
- Muah muah.

164
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,681
The moment.

165
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:00,843
Wait wait no no.

166
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:02,643
- So grab a bushel of fries.

167
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,055
- A bush, why not just one?

168
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:05,915
- Okay.

169
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:06,748
- What?

170
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:07,844
- This is gonna be awesome.

171
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:09,322
- You're not going to be able to fit that in your mouth.

172
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:10,155
- Watch me.

173
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:10,988
All right you first.

174
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:12,321
- All right, oh.

175
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:15,719
- What?

176
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,552
- Whoa.

177
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:17,385
- Is it good?

178
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:18,218
- Yes.

179
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,484
- It's going to be very difficult to pull off.

180
00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:20,349
My hand's going in.

181
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:21,658
- Oh really? - Yep.

182
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:23,000
- You had to stick your hand in?

183
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,833
- I did.

184
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,209
I'm going for it okay here we go.

185
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:26,153
Three. - I wanted to

186
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:27,986
eat this at one point.

187
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:31,056
Whoa.

188
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:34,243
I guess your mouth is too, no.

189
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:36,660
No, I wanted to do that, why?

190
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:40,763
I'm just going to let you deal with this problem.

191
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:41,596
How is it?

192
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,833
- Okay uh.

193
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,062
First impression, surprise.

194
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:47,073
Can't believe I fit that in my mouth.

195
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:48,617
- Well technically you didn't fit all of it

196
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:50,304
'cause there's a lot of fries left in there.

197
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:52,274
- Okay okay okay not all of it.

198
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:53,625
I got 80% of it bro.

199
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,894
That's still pretty impressive.

200
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:55,965
- More like 50.

201
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,117
- Oh come on.

202
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:59,208
- Okay so now we dump the rest of these in there

203
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,639
and we blend everything up.

204
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,472
- Mmkay.

205
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:03,677
- No that's supposed to go in there.

206
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:04,579
No. - It's okay let's go.

207
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:05,412
Pop the top on.

208
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:06,245
- We're just blending it.

209
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:08,627
(grinding)

210
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:10,141
- Yeah I don't think the blender's going to make it bro.

211
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:11,050
- Gonna push it down with a spoon.

212
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,150
- Your elbow's rather close to my face

213
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,707
so I'm going to hang out, no.

214
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:14,540
(scream)

215
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,925
Okay cool there we go, it's good to go.

216
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:16,758
All right you ready?

217
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:17,739
Let's see how this tastes.

218
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:18,572
- All right. - Okay no one's ever

219
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:19,405
done this before.

220
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:20,559
Key bros making history.

221
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,996
- Probably going to taste totally different

222
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:23,265
than what we just tried.

223
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:26,787
- It's like this is the new way to drink guys, you go.

224
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:29,789
(slurping)

225
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,300
- Mmm that's delicious.

226
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,065
It tastes exactly like the other thing

227
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,815
which was delicious and so, it's delicious.

228
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,209
- Dude this is so good.

229
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,439
The milkshake is like (lips smacking)

230
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,752
and then combined with the french fry

231
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:43,934
that just (lips smacking)

232
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:45,243
it's just amazing.

233
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:46,184
This is so good.

234
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:48,320
This next part I do with the utmost pleasure.

235
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,506
It's time to add the milk my,

236
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:51,186
milk my, french fry.

237
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:53,118
Milkshake french fry.

238
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:54,263
- Milk my french fry.

239
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:55,288
(laughing)

240
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,009
- You can't do that to a french fry.

241
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:00,329
We're going to add that to the big bowl.

242
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,162
Here we go.

243
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,334
- I'm actually really excited about this

244
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:05,702
because I hope it neutralizes the spiciness

245
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:06,535
of the Sriracha sauce.

246
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:07,850
(gibberish)

247
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,420
- It's a pizza.

248
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,400
- What?

249
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,233
- It's a pizza.

250
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,137
- Yeah well okay we got some M and Ms as well

251
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:15,307
and we're going to combine these into

252
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:16,623
a weird food combination,

253
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:18,549
but I think it's going to be delicious

254
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:19,984
because who doesn't love pizza

255
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:21,670
and who doesn't love M and Ms.

256
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,772
I mean it's going to be awesome.

257
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:24,209
Oh bro, spin it on your fingers.

258
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,042
- Oh that's going to be awesome.

259
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:26,586
Ready three two one.

260
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,419
(laughing)

261
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,400
- And not only are they M and Ms, they're.

262
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,277
(scream)

263
00:06:32,277 --> 00:06:33,110
again?

264
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,943
- Ow.

265
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:34,776
Ow okay. - I was going to say

266
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:36,415
they're fall flavored so we got candy corn

267
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:37,972
and whatever that was.

268
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:39,818
- At least one of them made it on there.

269
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,331
- Oh they smell good.

270
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,164
- Hoo!

271
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:42,997
- [Devin] All right you ready?

272
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:44,049
- Yup; all of them?

273
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:44,882
That's like more M and Ms than pizza.

274
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:46,221
- Overpowered by M and M flavor.

275
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:47,993
- First we got to re-distribute the M and Ms around,

276
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:48,826
oh that didn't work.

277
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:49,659
You just kind of.

278
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,571
- [Devin] Yeah you mean spread 'em out.

279
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,410
- And then we're going to go yeah.

280
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,548
(laughing)

281
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:56,140
Yeah; and then we get one more slice

282
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,973
directly down the center.

283
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:57,901
- You need to do more?

284
00:06:57,901 --> 00:06:59,699
I hope you never make my pizza.

285
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,539
You get it everywhere.

286
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,098
Well we had a nice pizza.

287
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:04,411
- Yeah we have a nice pizza Devin.

288
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:05,312
Be grateful for what we have,

289
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:06,172
this is delicious here.

290
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:07,243
Let's give it a shot.

291
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:08,243
- All right.

292
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,710
Just like I thought, it's amazing.

293
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,596
- Yeah, yeah this is awesome.

294
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:16,556
(mumbling)

295
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:17,498
Love it.

296
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:19,241
That is the choice slice.

297
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:20,547
Pop it in.

298
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:21,380
- Why? - There

299
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,869
and then I got to grab all of these.

300
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:24,933
Yep there we go.

301
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,063
This is probably the weirdest food combination yet.

302
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:30,104
It is cheese mixed with apple pie Oreos.

303
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:31,088
- Wait they make those?

304
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:32,233
- Yeah and so basically you got to melt

305
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,501
the cheese first, we got to add some avocado oil.

306
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:35,850
We've never used a hot plate before

307
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,125
but now is the first time 'cause we got

308
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,014
to melt some cheese.

309
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:39,874
- Wha no no no no.

310
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:40,707
- Why?

311
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:42,369
- You got to spread around the oil with the cheese.

312
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:43,515
- [Mr. Keys] What, is that even a thing?

313
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:46,604
- I don't know but I need to spread the oil some how.

314
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:47,517
There we go.

315
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:48,350
- [Mr. Keys] Oh it's heating up.

316
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,937
Oh. - What?

317
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,163
- Bro it's melting the cheese.

318
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:52,800
So the cheese is melting, it's all in the oil

319
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,138
and it's looking like prime candidate

320
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:57,235
for giving ya a stomach ache right now.

321
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:58,544
Now it's time to pop open the Oreos.

322
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,561
- No no no no.

323
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,241
No no let me do it, let me do it.

324
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,074
- Okay.

325
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:02,907
(scream)

326
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:05,136
You know what since the cheese is still very hot right now,

327
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:06,653
chopstick me.

328
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,719
Ow.

329
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:08,948
(laughing)

330
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,382
So we got some chop,

331
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:11,265
(laughing)

332
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:12,098
got some chopsticks.

333
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:13,797
So we're going to skewer our Oreos.

334
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:14,630
- [Devin] In the middle.

335
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,517
- Yeah stick it in the middle

336
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:16,790
and we're going to put it in the cheese.

337
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,142
I'm going to try to get all sides of it.

338
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:19,864
Oh my gosh that's a lot of cheese okay.

339
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:21,171
It already smells very interesting

340
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:22,771
'cause it's very like sweet mixed with

341
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:24,491
the tang of the cheese.

342
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:25,764
So we have a fork so I'm going to use a fork

343
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:26,786
to get cheese on top.

344
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:28,299
- [Both] Ooh.

345
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,132
- [Devin] That's nice.

346
00:08:29,132 --> 00:08:29,965
- That's the way to go.

347
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:31,444
All right let's eat a cheese covered Oreo man.

348
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,694
Here we go three, two, one.

349
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:36,006
Wait wait wait first we've got a challenge.

We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel,

355
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:46,580

356
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,913

357
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:51,793
- If you can do that comment down below.

358
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:53,677
Keyper Squad right now and let's see

359
00:08:53,677 --> 00:08:55,396
how this thing tastes man.

360
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:56,229
I'm actually excited.

361
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,646
Three two one go.

362
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,907
Whoa.

363
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,407
- This is so good.

364
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:07,132
- Hands down my favorite one we've ever done.

365
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,489
- Best one so far.

366
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:09,881
- This is hands down the most delicious

367
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:12,227
weird food combination we've ever had.

368
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:15,127
It's the creaminess of the cheese mixed

369
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:15,960
with just.

370
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:18,325
- Nicely done.

371
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:19,158
- Thanks; oh look at that,

372
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,098
look at that, look it.

373
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:21,088
Grab the bowl grab the bowl.

374
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:22,557
Get it quick quick quick quick quick quick.

375
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:23,390
- I didn't know you were doing this.

376
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,606
- All right boom there we, oh come on

377
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,950
it's stuck it's stuck it's stuck all right.

378
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,016
And I want to get a little bit extra.

379
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:27,892
Come on out (muttering)

380
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:29,531
- Dude dude dude dude.

381
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:30,364
- Oh no.

382
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:31,197
- What?

383
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,767
- Dude we've ruined mom's sauce pan again.

384
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,199
This is ruined.

385
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,507
We're definitely going to be in trouble after this one

386
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,149
and right now let's go to the next.

387
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,190
Devin, what's better than a dozen eggs?

388
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,773
- Uh, I don't know.

389
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,622
- Come on bro it's scrambled eggs

390
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:46,346
with candy in it.

391
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:47,179
- Okay.

392
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:50,233
- So I am a master egg cooker

393
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,221
or cookered egg person.

394
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:52,658
Please work with me.

395
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:53,850
Uh okay.

396
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,737
- Wait it requires 12?

397
00:09:55,737 --> 00:09:56,570
- 12 eggs.

398
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,537
- 12? - 12 eggs.

399
00:09:57,537 --> 00:09:58,844
- You don't know how much 12 eggs is.

400
00:09:58,844 --> 00:09:59,698
- Yeah I do.

401
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:00,591
- That's a lot of egg.

402
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:02,111
I don't know if I support this motion.

403
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,051
- [Collins] Yo we eggin'.

404
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:03,951
- [Devin] Oh no.

405
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,667
- Oh you dropped a shell, get that out Devin,

406
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:06,500
get that out.

407
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,333
E.

408
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,987
- [Both] E.

409
00:10:08,987 --> 00:10:10,714
- So Devin I actually have a confession to make.

410
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:11,547
- Okay.

411
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:13,085
- This recipe only called for two eggs.

412
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:14,146
- I knew it.

413
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,833
This is gonna get messy real quick.

414
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:16,939
- [Collins] That's why you got to kind of use

415
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:17,880
a blade in this one,

416
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,108
just kind of break up the yolks.

417
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:19,941
- Really? - Yep.

418
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:20,826
- I'll be right back.

419
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:21,659
- Okay.

420
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,977
- So whenever I'm making eggs I always

421
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:27,593
get myself some good Montauk white pepper

422
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,682
and some good ole dill.

423
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:30,765
- Dill? - Yes.

424
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:33,112
Enjoy.

425
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:33,945
Enjoy.

426
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:35,326
- [Collins] Oh man it's got a bizarre odor to it.

427
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,159
- Yeah just want to whiff it?

428
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,992
- I don't want to smell it.

429
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:37,825
I don't want to smell it.

430
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,966
- Uh love me the smell of some dill.

431
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,876
All right now for the Montauk white pepper.

432
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,486
- Bro I can already smell the heat.

433
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:46,426
(laughing)

434
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:48,234
It burns my nostrils, my eyes are watering.

435
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,204
This is starting to look pretty saucy right now.

436
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:51,391
Eggs are coming together man,

437
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:52,251
the smell is terrible. - All right

438
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,353
gonna add. - That's way too much of 'em.

439
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,282
- I disagree. - What?

440
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:56,870
Okay we're not going to have room for any of this.

441
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,220
Now we're just burning candy corn.

442
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,066
Oh my gosh my day is ruined.

443
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:00,919
- Adding these in.

444
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,752
- You're kidding me?

445
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:02,842
That's too many! - No I'm not

446
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:03,985
and I got to eat one at the same time.

447
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:04,818
- What?

448
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:07,013
There's no way that last one's going in here.

449
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:07,846
- Yes it is.

450
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:08,679
- No!

451
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,512
- The whole bag.

452
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:11,439
- Dude it-- - It's all going in.

453
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:12,272
- Oh my gosh.

454
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,928
All right this is looking pretty interesting

455
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:14,761
to say the least

456
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:15,766
so if you ever want to get your morning

457
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:18,432
off to a very sugary start, this is the way to go.

458
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:19,332
So you ready?

459
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:20,165
- Yeah I'm ready.

460
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:21,309
- Here we go three, don't touch my spoon.

461
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:22,948
- Well I cheers you.

462
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:23,865
- Two, one.

463
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:27,428
- This is weird.

464
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:30,484
- The candy has become powder.

465
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:31,634
All right so we're going to add it in right now.

466
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:33,561
- And it's crazy, like you don't even taste

467
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:34,542
any of the egg.

468
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,757
All the candy just overpowers everything.

469
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:38,398
- [Collins] Oh my gosh I can't even hold it.

470
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,297
- We got to get it out of here.

471
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:40,321
- It's the Montauk white powder

472
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,030
and the dill bro.

473
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,863
- Yeah.

474
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:43,917
Do not knock the cup over.

475
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:44,750
- I won't knock the cup over.

476
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,583
I promise.

477
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,661
So apparently this is a very popular

478
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:48,131
weird food combination but basically you take

479
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:51,929
a stick of butter and put in a cup of coffee.

480
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:52,779
(screaming)

481
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:53,637
And today we don't have have coffee,

482
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:55,568
we actually have pumpkin spice lattes.

483
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:56,966
- Which we've never had.

484
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,770
So you want to just give this a test first.

485
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,929
- Yeah give you a little taste test.

486
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,528
Mmm.

487
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:04,672
- What bro it's a latte.

488
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:07,377
It's not even like actual coffee, it's the latte.

489
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,097
- Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm.

490
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:09,930
I don't know what's wrong with me

491
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,124
'cause like apparently everyone loves pumpkin spice latte

492
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:13,017
but like...

493
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:14,456
- Seriously what is wrong with you.

494
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:17,686
Do we just, is it the whole stick of butt.

495
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:20,894
I look away for one second and you do that?

496
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:21,915
How's the butter though.

497
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:22,943
Oh no is he gonna.

498
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:23,925
(scream)

499
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,934
- [Collins] How come yours fit and mine didn't?

500
00:12:25,934 --> 00:12:27,663
- 'Cause I actually drank a lot of mine.

501
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,923
- Oh. - Yep.

502
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:30,565
All right well let's see if it tastes any different.

503
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:31,815
- Ready? - Yeah.

504
00:12:36,226 --> 00:12:37,726
Bro, it's so good.

505
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:42,091
Dude just go, you can spit it out.

506
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:42,949
Bro are you good?

507
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:43,847
- I'm not good.

508
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,276
Can we please not like add this

509
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:46,774
to the main bowl because I do not want

510
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,082
to experience this again.

511
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:49,434
- No, no we have to.

512
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,235
- No come on. - This is what they want.

513
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:52,464
- Okay that's it that's enough that's,

514
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:54,639
no stop stop stop stop stop.

515
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,907
- Oh almost forgot the butter.

516
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:57,019
- No no no no no dude what

517
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,321
you put my whole thing in there!

518
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,942
- No why is the Sriracha back?

519
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:03,545
- Because we're putting it on caramel apples.

520
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:04,688
- No!

521
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:05,796
- And here's my theory.

522
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:06,826
I don't think the Sriracha's going to taste bad

523
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:08,568
at all because on the caramel apples

524
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:10,948
and caramel apples are (lips smacking) delicious.

525
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:14,435
Dude oh I love caramel apples so much.

526
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:16,241
- There you go.

527
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,672
What is that, what are you doing?

528
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,619
What, it's not part of it.

529
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:21,807
That was a little piece.

530
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:23,202
- Uh Devin I need to borrow your box for a second.

531
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,562
- Go for it.

532
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:25,829
- Ye! - No!

533
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,259
- Ye-yah.

534
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:29,379
There's like a little hole in the top of mine.

535
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,772
- Oh it's perfect for some Sriracha sauce.

536
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:31,997
- Some Sriracha sauce.

537
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:33,867
Oh man my beautiful caramel apple.

538
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:34,700
- Oh that's a lot.

539
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,452
You making a huge mistake.

540
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:37,511
That's not good.

541
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:38,344
(laughing)

542
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:40,545
Dude I'm going for a very honest amount.

543
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:41,435
There we go.

544
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:42,268
- You wanna go for that much?

545
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,101
- Well yeah.

546
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:44,513
- Mine's intense.

547
00:13:44,513 --> 00:13:45,846
Three, two, one.

548
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:51,052
(laughing)

549
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:52,552
Is it not working?

550
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:54,947
(laughing)

551
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,464
You got Sriracha all around your mouth bro.

552
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:57,297
How is it?

553
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:58,356
(mumbling)

554
00:13:58,356 --> 00:13:59,189
- Oh it's hot.

555
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:00,074
- It's hot? - Mmhmm.

556
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:00,907
- Oh no.

557
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,695
Oh man here we go.

558
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:04,127
I've procrastinated as long as I possible can bro.

559
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:04,960
No ah.

560
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,570
(muffled scream)

561
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:13,534
- It doesn't even get better.

562
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:16,935
The Sriracha is just overpowering.

563
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:18,859
- Dude it's like around my lips are burning.

564
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,614
My lips are like on fire brother.

565
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:22,530
- I know my lips on the side here hurt.

566
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,551
(muffled talking)

567
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:25,475
- Why would you suggest this?

568
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:26,721
- Who likes this?

569
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:27,667
- It was a terrible suggestion.

570
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,597
As the reward for the complete devastation

571
00:14:29,597 --> 00:14:31,016
our mouths just went through,

572
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:32,990
this one is awesome.

573
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,386
Pumpkin spice Cheerios mixed,

574
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:36,562
you ready for it, with chocolate.

575
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:38,035
- Hey, and oh don't forget milk.

576
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:39,368
- Yeah and milk.

577
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:43,215
- What, that's not even necessary.

578
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,645
That's not even how anybody, no.

579
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:46,630
- I opened it.

580
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,182
- You opened it with your teeth.

581
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:50,024
- So maybe like a couple of Cheerios will fall out.

582
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:51,907
- Oh yeah there you go.

583
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:52,740
Nice.

584
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,751
I don't recommend this to anybody.

585
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:55,303
- Oh it smells so good.

586
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:56,774
Some Cheerios.

587
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:57,674
- [Devin] Oh give me some.

588
00:14:57,674 --> 00:14:58,533
- Devin. - What?

589
00:14:58,533 --> 00:14:59,366
- Do you know what I'm about

590
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,199
to do this box?

591
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,032
- No idea.

592
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:01,865
No.

593
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:03,326
- Fleet.

594
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:04,346
It's a forward yeet.

595
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:06,158
Next step we got to add the chocolate.

596
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:06,991
So. - What?

597
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,425
Dude I need some.

598
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:10,258
- There you go.

599
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:11,591
All yourS Devin.

600
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:13,482
Awesome.

601
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:14,315
- That's it?

602
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:15,148
- Yeah that's it.

603
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:15,981
- Really? - Fling.

604
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:16,814
(multiple talking)

605
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:17,647
What you're takIng some of my chocolates.

606
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:18,480
- Oh of course I am.

607
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,489
- What, I like my chocolate.

608
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:20,431
Okay I need a bigger bowl

609
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:22,076
and a bigger spoon, look how small this thing is.

610
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:23,099
Okay how do we mix this around.

611
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:24,078
Give me one moment.

612
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:25,310
Some reason I've always wanted

613
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,418
to eat cereal out of a blender.

614
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:27,854
And also I couldn't find any bigger bowls.

615
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:29,125
Not a goal it's just been a dream.

616
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,417
Oh, wait I've got another idea.

617
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:32,250
- What? - All right,

618
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,083
here we go.

619
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:33,956
Gonna pop the top on. - Oh.

620
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:35,507
- You got to properly mix all

621
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:36,817
your chocolate chips into the cereal

622
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:38,500
so what better way to do it.

623
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,482
- Like a maraca.

624
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,459
(shaking)

625
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,376
I say it's about mixed.

626
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:47,141
(gibberish)

627
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:47,974
All right milk time.

628
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:48,807
- All right.

629
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:49,640
How much milk?

630
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,473
- That's good stop stop stop stop stop.

631
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:51,890
Yeah. - No, no no.

632
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,552
No, no!

633
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:55,582
I don't support this motion.

634
00:15:55,582 --> 00:15:58,754
Really all of that to just put it back in the bowl?

635
00:15:58,754 --> 00:16:00,921
- Living on the edge.

636
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:01,898
- Mmm.

637
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:03,659
How can someone not like this.

638
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,076
- [Both] Mmm mmm.

639
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:08,533
- Whoa bro slow down there.

640
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:09,682
Slow down dude.

641
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:11,159
It is really good though.

642
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,961
All of what he is saying I'm translating.

643
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:14,765
Mmm Mmm Mmm so good.

644
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,077
Add it into the bowl.

645
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:18,258
And add mine too because it's so good.

646
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,091
- Mmmhmm.

647
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,325
That was incredible. - So good.

648
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,004
- Like I want to have that every single morning.

649
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:25,587
Not very healthy but still absolutely delicious

650
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:27,682
and right now we are onto the final round

651
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,719
and then after that we're going to eat all of this

652
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,640
which is literally the weirdest food combination

653
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,908
in the entire world.

654
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,767
If there's one thing you notice

655
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,521
about this bread Devin what is it?

656
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,108
- Uh crusty?

657
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:38,297
- No it's flat.

658
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,130
(laughing)

659
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,170
So guys apparently this combination we take flat bread

660
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,317
and put yogurt on it.

661
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:43,584
It's pumpkin spice yogurt

662
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:44,801
that we're going to be putting that on it.

663
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:45,634
- It's spice?

664
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:46,467
- It's spicy.

665
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,237
- Oh it's got a funky smell.

666
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:49,070
Ready? - Yeah.

667
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,783
So we're going to kind of lather it on.

668
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:52,501
- I'm going to do a little drizzle.

669
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:53,334
- Oh.

670
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:54,299
Again the difference between Devin and I,

671
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:55,239
he just does a little drizzle

672
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,588
and I was like (groan).

673
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:57,738
Oh no no no no it's coming off the side,

674
00:16:57,738 --> 00:16:58,571
it's coming off the side.

675
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:00,323
No mayday mayday mayday no no no.

676
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:01,589
- [Devin] This drizzle is not turning out.

677
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,863
- So we both have very approaches to this flat bread.

678
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:06,046
- I think mine is gonna be great

679
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:08,017
'cause it has less yogurt on it.

680
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:09,779
- [Collins] All that matters is that the bread's flat

681
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,046
and the yogurt is yogurt.

682
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:11,879
- Exactly.

683
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:12,725
- All right you ready for the bite?

684
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:13,748
- I'm ready for the bite.

685
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:14,691
- And this one here was suggested

686
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:15,965
by the Instagram Keyper of the week

687
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,317
so shout out to you and if you want

688
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:18,796
to be featured as the Instagram Keyper of the week,

689
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:20,791
check the description down below to find out how.

690
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,796
That way you can make us eat some really crazy stuff.

691
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:23,629
All right here we go.

692
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:25,582
Three, two one.

693
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:26,607
I want to break my flat bread first.

694
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:27,956
I'm going to crack my flat bread in half.

695
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:28,789
- I'm just going to eat it.

696
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:29,622
- My bread's been cracked.

697
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:31,122
I broke the bread.

698
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:35,037
Oh no.

699
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:36,287
Oh no no no no.

700
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:38,928
- That is weird.

701
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:39,761
- I can't even swallow.

702
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:41,549
This is officially the weirdest combination

703
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:42,861
I have ever tried bro.

704
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,797
That was just oh gosh.

705
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,138
- I don't know if it's the weirdest.

706
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:46,485
We've tried some pretty weird ones.

707
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:47,874
No why, yours no no no.

708
00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:49,602
- Yeah no. - Yours has so much.

709
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,710
- [Collins] Dude it's so gross.

710
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,731
- Uh I think it's the pumpkin

711
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:52,959
that throws this whole thing off.

712
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:53,792
- Yeah I think it's the pumpkin

713
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,130
that just takes it and just like,

714
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,482
it's the pumpkin was like fiboof.

715
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:58,044
So I got to say like individually

716
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,316
they all probably would have been pretty good

717
00:17:59,316 --> 00:18:00,956
but these, which are really good on their own,

718
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,720
together are horrible.

719
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,035
Like horrible.

720
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,926
But right now let's go to the final round.

721
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:07,636
With this final one I don't even know

722
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:08,469
what we're doing.

723
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:11,375
Apparently it's a nacho cheese apple pie

724
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,486
and pumpkin pie.

725
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,161
- Yeah but I only see one problem.

726
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,349
Apple pie's my favorite. - No, no

727
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:16,182
no no.

728
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,015
It's my apple pie.

729
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:17,852
Why don't we do this, why don't we get rid

730
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:18,874
of the pumpkin pie, just use the apple

731
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:19,817
so we're both happy. - Let's do it.

732
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,288
- Pop open the nacho cheese.

733
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:22,371
Oh. - Wait no.

734
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:24,977
Bro we got to save some.

735
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:27,111
If I know you was going to be gone in no time.

736
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:29,166
All right here we go.

737
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:29,999
Whoops.

738
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:31,844
Can we go for this side to side motion.

739
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:32,677
- Okay. - Well I'm going

740
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:34,558
to try to pick it up from the side.

741
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,304
Oh this is actually kind of working.

742
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:38,986
And then I'm going to get some cheese.

743
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:39,819
- That's a good idea.

744
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,472
- I'm ready, are you ready?

745
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:43,743
- [Collins] So I think I'm going to dip my chip.

746
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:44,576
- [Devin] Dip your chip.

747
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:45,910
- I got to dip my chip yip.

748
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,809
I will never crack my chip.

749
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,459
- Yes you will. - Before I make the dip.

750
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:50,177
Oh I cracked my chip before I made the dip.

751
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:51,856
- It was during the dip but sure.

752
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:52,795
- So I think how this works we're going to pop

753
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:53,628
it in here.

754
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:54,839
I'm going to remove part of the apple pie

755
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,606
and then oh, mmm. - Got to hold the crust.

756
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:57,439
What, what?

757
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,272
- Ideas are everywhere.

758
00:18:58,272 --> 00:18:59,568
Oh it's a little sandwich.

759
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:01,498
All right here we go apple pie nachos.

760
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:02,563
Never thought I would eat this.

761
00:19:02,563 --> 00:19:06,175
All right here we go three two one.

762
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,156
- That is weird.

763
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:07,989
- I like it.

764
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:08,835
- Not bad.

765
00:19:08,835 --> 00:19:10,309
- This one here's like a surprise winner.

766
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,948
It was last place all along

767
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:14,286
and then at the last moment of chewing it

768
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,450
there's like weird combination of flavors takes place

769
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,516
that just takes it and makes it incredible.

770
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:20,375
It's awesome.

771
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,208
- Yeah it's pretty good.

772
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,092
- So now we're going to add it in here.

773
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:25,131
Time to eat the weirdest food combination ever.

774
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,348
Just go for the whole pie man 'cause why not.

775
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:28,947
Let's oh.

776
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:30,959
- Wait I wanted some of the pie.

777
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,680
- I'm going to use my apple as like a plunger.

778
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,932
On the bright side this is the most fall

779
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:36,822
slash Halloween looking food combination.

780
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:37,685
- That is very true. - You could,

781
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:38,951
it's like all orange. - I know.

782
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:40,263
- On the down side.

783
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,278
- We have to eat it.

784
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:42,303
- So I'll take my spoon

785
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:43,136
- There you go.

786
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:44,432
- [Collins] Let's mix it around a little bit.

787
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:45,497
- [Both] Uh.

788
00:19:45,497 --> 00:19:47,309
- Oh man this got Sriracha sauce in,

789
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:48,790
it's got coffee in it.

790
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,895
- What is that? - It's got chocolate.

791
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:50,728
- [Devin] What is that dangling?

792
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:51,561
- [Both] Uh.

793
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:52,431
- I don't even want to eat this.

794
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:53,710
And comment down below right now.

795
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,847
What are some other really weird food combinations

796
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:58,272
you would love to see us eat in another video.

797
00:19:58,272 --> 00:20:00,117
The scariest part of this is that

798
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,709
the reason this thing's all orange

799
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:03,574
is because it's Sriracha sauce.

800
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:04,722
- Oh I forgot.

801
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:05,953
- Cheers, here we go.

802
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:08,251
Three, oh I'm not excited about this.

803
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:09,751
- [Both] Two, one.

804
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:16,334
- Scu, mine, okay wait

805
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:19,344
wait wait wait wait wait wait.

806
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,101
Mine is awesome.

807
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:22,986
And I dare you right now, you have five seconds.

808
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:24,575
Look right over here you have five.

809
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:27,079
- [Both] Four, three, two, one,

810
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,236
done bye.

811
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:30,242
- Love you guys, woo hoo.

812
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:31,385
This is so delicious.

813
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:32,905
- [Devin] Oh gross, ugh.
