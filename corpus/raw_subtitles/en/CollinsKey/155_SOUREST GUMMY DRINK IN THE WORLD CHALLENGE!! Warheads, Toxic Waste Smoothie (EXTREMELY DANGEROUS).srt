1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,634
- Have you ever eaten so much sour candy,

2
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,896
it made your face look like this?

3
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:04,791
(laughter)

4
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:06,899
Well today, we are taking real food verses gummy food

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,021
and making it sour off of your suggestions,

6
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:11,931
and today I'm here with Cole, Savannah, and Everleigh.

7
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:14,377
We also did a video on their channel.

8
00:00:14,377 --> 00:00:15,624
So make sure you go check it out,

9
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:16,656
subscribe to their channel, and give

10
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:18,761
that video a thumbs up, and stick around

11
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:20,920
till the end of this video because we all

12
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,689
have to drink the sourest gummy food drink

13
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:26,102
in the entire world out of this blender.

14
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:27,730
But right now, let's get into it.

15
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,362
So for round number one, you guys suggested gummy bears.

16
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:31,471
We don't know which is which.

17
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:34,325
One of these is super sour, one of them is normal.

18
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,627
We're gonna find out which is which.

19
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:36,843
You wanna pull it off on the count of three?

20
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:37,760
- [Savannah] Uh-oh

21
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,993
Alright, here we go. Three, two, one, go!

22
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:42,542
(screams)

23
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,910
- We got the, no!

24
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,191
- You got the sour one!

25
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:47,750
- [Devan] No! - [Savannah] No, Everleigh!

26
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,150
- [Devan] She's switching sides?!

27
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,541
- [Collins] She switched sides on us!

28
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,001
- Hey babe, do you wanna... should we, should we family?

29
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,086
- They're just going family style.

30
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:55,133
I guess we're family as well.

31
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:56,692
You take that end, I'll take this end.

32
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:58,184
Alright here we go, three, two, one, go.

33
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:00,184
You take your bite. - Oh!

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,402
(painful hum)

35
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:06,191
- Come on! Come on! Get it! Come on!

36
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,626
(laughs) (disgusted sounds)

37
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:10,861
- This hurts my tongue!

38
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:11,811
- Oh! - Ah!

39
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:14,033
- You wanna lick one of the bear's paws and try that?

40
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,655
- Yes, a little piece.

41
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:16,708
- A little piece, just lick the paw right there.

42
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,229
- [Devan] Just lick it!

43
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:19,062
- Good!

44
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:20,486
- [Devan] What?! (laughter)

45
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:21,319
- What?!

46
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,269
- [Everleigh] I like the sour!

47
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:24,272
(laughter) - What?!

48
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:25,977
- Well, lucky you, you're gonna really enjoy this challenge!

49
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:27,604
Alright guys, so now we need to add a piece

50
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:28,849
of this super sour gummy bear,

51
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,782
I'm gonna go for the head and the ear over here,

52
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:32,287
into the drink. (laughter)

53
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:33,734
This is a tough gummy bear.

54
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:36,109
This might be kinda graphic. We might have to censor this.

55
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,504
(straining grunts) (laughter)

56
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:39,337
- What are you doing?!

57
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:40,415
- I can't even get it off.

58
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:41,948
- [Devan] Dude! - Alright, there we go!

59
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:43,131
- That's a little barbaric, don't ya think?

60
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:45,014
- The first piece of the sour drink.

61
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:46,535
- [Cole] Let's get a little bit of the

62
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,151
sour powder in there too.

63
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,505
(screams and laughs)

64
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:50,621
- [Savannah] Eewww!

65
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:52,284
- Alright guys, on to the next round.

66
00:01:52,284 --> 00:01:53,298
- Alright, but I'm gonna take another bite.

67
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:54,139
- Alright, cool.

68
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:54,972
Is it that good? - [Savannah] Uh-huh.

69
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:56,245
- It smells delicious, we got the terrible one.

70
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:57,303
- The regular one is pretty good.

71
00:01:57,303 --> 00:01:58,956
- Next up, you guys suggested gummy worms

72
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:00,985
versus sour gummy worms so one of us

73
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:02,705
is gonna be getting sour ones.

74
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,656
You ready? Three, two, one!

75
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:08,029
(screams)

76
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:09,327
- Wait wait wait!

77
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:10,498
- These are real worms!

78
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,575
- Oh my gosh!

79
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:13,728
New rule, I will give one switch rule,

80
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:15,276
which means that each of us will have

81
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:16,506
one opportunity to switch, so if you guys

82
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:18,847
wanna choose this round to be your switch round,

83
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,708
you guys can switch and you won't have to --

84
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,771
(Cole screams) (laughter)

85
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:25,627
- [Savannah] How'd he touch it?

86
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:27,671
(screams)

87
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:29,676
- They're not like normal worms!

88
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:31,044
- [Collins] Oh my gosh!

89
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:32,418
(Everleigh screams)

90
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,595
(laughter)

91
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:36,325
- She said, hey hey next round, let's go.

92
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,454
Do you wanna switch it now?

93
00:02:37,454 --> 00:02:39,228
- Yeah. - We're swapping.

94
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:40,356
- Swapping? Oh no!

95
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:41,709
- [Cole] Hey babe, I'm gonna pick yours and you pick mine.

96
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,242
Okay I'm eating this one. Okay, ready?

97
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:46,915
(screams and laughs)

98
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:48,651
- I don't know if that's a good swap!

99
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:50,234
Babe, try this one.

100
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,710
(laughter)

101
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,458
Yeah. Yeah. (Savannah screams)

102
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,111
- Oh my God that's so sour!

103
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:58,944
(Everleigh coughs)

104
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,495
- I got extra sour powder on there, you see that?

105
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:01,558
- Yeah just a little bit. Oh no!

106
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:02,691
- [Everleigh] Try it!

107
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:03,567
- It's that bad?

108
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,199
- Yeah! No, it's great! It's gnarly.

109
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,564
- They ate the first sour and they're both like...

110
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:07,909
(Collins laughs)

111
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:10,326
- That's the way to go. - Oh!

112
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:14,085
Oh my gosh.

113
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:16,150
- Yeah, exactly. It's bad. - [Devan] It is very sour.

114
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,535
- [Collins] Grab your worm. Ah! It moved. It moved.

115
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:19,823
(laughter) It moved so much.

116
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:21,798
- They're worms, of course they move.

117
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:24,800
- Ah! It's so active bro. They got muscles.

118
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,070
- This guy seems super chilled.

119
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,800
- Yeah grab the chilled one. Mine's like, whipping bro.

120
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,473
Alright guys, we're about to eat real worms right now!

121
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:32,834
But first, we've got to challenge.

122
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,270
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel,

00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,833
- Ah! Ah! Ah! It's eating you!

137
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,543
- I know! Alright, here we go!

138
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:58,397
- Dude! Mine is doing moonwalk, look at this!

139
00:03:58,397 --> 00:03:59,399
(Collins laughs) - Here we go!

140
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,490
- It's totally moving backwards.

141
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,722
- It's on my wrist.

142
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:03,609
Three, two... - No. No.

143
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:04,442
(Everleigh screams)

144
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:05,642
- I gotta pick it up first.

145
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:06,671
- I'm so sick.

146
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:10,838
(Collins screams) (group screams)

147
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:16,914
- Oh, I need a moment. (laughter)

148
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:18,580
I need a moment. (beep)

149
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,307
Alright you guys get to put the gummy worms...

150
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:25,264
I'm gonna pretend I'm not traumatized. Next round...

151
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,632
Ya'll are crazy. Who would suggest this? Let's go.

152
00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:28,934
- Alright, but I'm gonna take another bite.

153
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:32,148
- Next up, you guys suggested watermelon, so here we go.

154
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:36,148
Three, two, one. (group screams)

155
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,024
- Oh wait, does that mean it has sour stuff on it?

156
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,880
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, is that glazed?

157
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,729
- [Devan] Hold on.

158
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,375
- There's, like, already, like, chunks taken out of it.

159
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,985
- [Devan] Wait. I'm sorry. What's --

160
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,595
- I'm, I'm super suspicious.

161
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:48,620
- What has been done to this watermelon?

162
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,345
- I feel like, this one looks like it's the bad one,

163
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:53,371
but in reality, that's the bad one.

164
00:04:53,371 --> 00:04:55,301
- Alright, so they're gonna do the sour watermelon.

165
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,635
We've got the real watermelon.

166
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:58,751
Our's looks very tampered with, like,

167
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,441
if this was in the store I would immediately ask for my

168
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:01,519
money back. - I'm very suspicious.

169
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,021
- This looks -- Ah! Sorry, it's just watermelon.

170
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,665
Why am I trippin'? Alright, ya'll ready?

171
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:07,597
- Dude what's that?! (slow motion voices)

172
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:09,415
(laughter)

173
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:10,841
- Scared me. So, I was about to like, fling this.

174
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,366
Watermelon's about to be on the ceiling.

175
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,199
(Collins laughs)

176
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,781
So I guess we're all gonna go at the same time.

177
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,589
Oh, she already went! - Oh, she's already in!

178
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:20,127
- It looks tampered with, but I'm sure

179
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,722
it's just a regular watermelon.

180
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,302
- Sourest watermelon ever.

181
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:25,067
- There's gotta be nothing different about,

182
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:28,068
I mean, nothing's popping out of it, there's nothing

183
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:31,241
- Alright, here we go, three, two, one

184
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,673
(screams)

185
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:36,617
(high pitched screams)

186
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:37,450
- Ah!

187
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:41,740
- [Savannah] So sour.

188
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,848
- Ah! - My lip is burning.

189
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:45,467
- What did, what did you do to it?

190
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,250
Are we really puttin', I guess we're puttin this

191
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,066
super sour watermelon in, I guess we put

192
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:51,295
it in along with the sour candy

193
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:52,155
as well. - Should we put these too?

194
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:52,988
They are sour.

195
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:53,821
- Yeah. - Yeah, we'll do both,

196
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:54,892
- So, yeah. Go for it. - That's a good one.

197
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,575
- She's goin' for all of'em!

198
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:57,529
- No, no. That's good.

199
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,503
- Alright, yeah, we're gonna call it off with that.

200
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:00,938
On to the next round. (scared scream)

201
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:02,256
- Alright, but I'ma take another bite.

202
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:03,514
- This next one, we kinda have

203
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:05,946
a hint of what it is. It's lollipop.

204
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:07,440
So here we go. You get to pull it off.

205
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,106
Three, two, one (screams)

206
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:13,856
- Yes! Yes! - We got the sour one.

207
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,498
- [Devan] She's already goin' for it.

208
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:20,395
(happy whistling music)

209
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:22,361
- The worst thing with, like, a sour lollipop

210
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:23,835
is like, it's not like you can chew on that gummy

211
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:27,048
to get rid of the sour, it's like you're licking sour.

212
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:28,129
- [Collins] Oh, no.

213
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,987
- Okay. - [Collins] Oh, no.

214
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:31,820
(gasps)

215
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,667
Oh, no!

216
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,511
(Savannah laughs)

217
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:35,688
- Babe, you gotta, like, get rid of it.

218
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,823
(laughter)

219
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,156
- Ouch!

220
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:41,124
- It hurts, right? - [Devan] Oh, no.

221
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:43,616
- I'm gonna go for this big powder spot, right here.

222
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:46,608
- [Devan] Oh, no. - [Collins] Dude, really?

223
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:47,691
- [Devan] Oh!

224
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,672
(Savannah laughs)

225
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:53,371
- Oh, and you got more than I did.

226
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,448
- You are like, so much more powder.

227
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,328
- So, I think, I think unfortunately

228
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:57,930
for the lollipop, we can't stick it in.

229
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,796
I think we're gonna move on to the

230
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:00,360
next round right now, but in thought --

231
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,193
- Why don't we just do this?

232
00:07:01,193 --> 00:07:02,120
- Yeah just give it a good dunk.

233
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,953
There you go. (laughter)

234
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:05,563
Just, some good old saliva DNA sourness. It's all good.

235
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:07,715
Alright guys, next round. Here we go.

236
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:08,930
- Alright, but I'm gonna take another bite.

237
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,260
- Three, two, one.

238
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,019
(screams)

239
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,406
- Yeah! We got soda!

240
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:16,971
- Soda? - Is that like, what is that?

241
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:19,066
It's like a, sour soda gummy.

242
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:22,132
- Look, this is like, cola gummies. Okay, so

243
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,460
- Okay, okay. We'll go first. - We'll go first.

244
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,293
- [Collins] You guys go first?

245
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:26,232
- I'm like, I can do sour stuff now.

246
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:28,215
♫ We get the good soda

247
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,985
♫ We get the soda

248
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:30,818
♫ We get the soda

249
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,799
- [Collins] There you go. Go.

250
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,207
- [All] Oooooooooooh!

251
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:36,709
- How was that?

252
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:37,565
- Bad.

253
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:38,555
(laughter)

254
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:42,257
- What's this one? (candy clinking)

255
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:46,939
(Cole screams) (laughter)

256
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:47,897
- Let me see it.

257
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:49,978
- Babe, do that. Do it! Just like,

258
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:51,577
suck on the candies inside of it.

259
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:55,716
- I swear, he's like a third brother, man. Like, I swear it.

260
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:57,271
- Do you taste that? - Oh!

261
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:58,476
(laughter)

262
00:07:58,476 --> 00:08:00,610
- So now we get to eat some delicious soda.

263
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,842
Here we go. - You're gonna eat soda?

264
00:08:01,842 --> 00:08:03,625
- I'll go first. Or, drink this soda, yeah.

265
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,528
It's soda, why not? Here we go. Three, two, one.

266
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,751
(gasps)

267
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:09,683
(laughter)

268
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:13,573
- Hold up! Hold up! Who said that this is gonna be sour?

269
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,200
Why is everything sour? I th--

270
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,450
- No one said it was sour! That's the issue!

271
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,621
- I thought it was sour verses not sour.

272
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:20,711
- What kinda soda is that? How did it--

273
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:21,708
- What is happening?

274
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,799
(sucking teeth) - Ah!

275
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,321
This is not a sour verses real.

276
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:27,598
This is let's prank people, especially Collins and Devan.

277
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:28,468
(laughter) - What?

278
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:30,135
- Ugh. I think we're just gonna dump this in here.

279
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,968
We need a liquid base for this, for this drink anyway.

280
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:36,011
- Oh! And, let's put some, some--

281
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:37,668
- I think we might need a little bit more soda later.

282
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:38,792
- Let's do it later, yeah.

283
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:41,737
- This drink is gonna cause some serious issues

284
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:44,097
when we have to drink it, but right now,

285
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:46,006
I guess, let's go for the next one.

286
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:47,357
- Alright, but I'm gonna take another bite.

287
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:48,502
- My teeth are already starting

288
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:50,110
to hurt from all this sour candy.

289
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,348
I can already feel it happening.

290
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:53,121
Let's see what this next one is. Three, two, one!

291
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,493
(gasps and screams)

292
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,867
No!

293
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,168
- Oh my gosh!

294
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:58,110
- [Collins] Wait, what is that?!

295
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,320
- Cat food! It's cat food! It's Friskies!

296
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,391
(screams) - [Collins] Wait!

297
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:03,510
- This is even a Friskies promo.

298
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,619
- We got, like, sour cat food? Okay.

299
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:07,886
- Bye bye.

300
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:09,046
- Aww, it's so gross.

301
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:10,655
(Savannah fake cries)

302
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,871
- You ready? I'm just gonna count down

303
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:12,905
and you just go for it. Ready?

304
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:13,738
- Okay.

305
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:16,432
- Okay, ready. Three, two, one, go!

306
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:18,448
- Chew it up! Chew it up! Chew it up! Chew it up!

307
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:19,945
(Collins and Devan groan)

308
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:22,458
(Cole laughs)

309
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,892
- Chew it up! I see it!

310
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:26,142
(laughter)

311
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,104
- That's gross.

312
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:30,255
- You are a, you are the real,

313
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:32,021
you are the real MVP on that one.

314
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:33,562
- [Collins And Devan] Oh my God!

315
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:34,520
- [Cole] Everleigh, did you just put it in?!

316
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,696
Everleigh put a piece in!

317
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:37,172
Everleigh put a piece in! - [Collins] Oh my gosh!

318
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:40,755
- [Savannah] Chew it up Everleigh, chew it!

319
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:42,911
(Everleigh grunts)

320
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,286
(laughter)

321
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:45,153
- Here we go. Three, two, one

322
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:46,928
- Hold up, I gotta, hold up! Bro--

323
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:48,437
- He's goin' for it! He's goin' for it!

324
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:49,270
He's goin' for it!

325
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,459
(candy chattering)

326
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,527
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

327
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:52,427
(Collins grunts)

328
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:53,769
- Nothing came out of mine.

329
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,058
- Here, take one of mine!

330
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:56,866
- No! No way! (Collins heaves)

331
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,544
(Collins heaves in slow motion)

332
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:00,210
- Oh! Oh! Oh, he's down! He's down!

333
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,582
- There's literally nothing coming out.

334
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:02,540
(Collins groans)

335
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,732
- Alright, I'm done!

336
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:04,934
(Savannah laughs)

337
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:05,991
- Let me warn you (mumbles)

338
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:08,794
- I guess we, I guess we just have to move on. Bummer.

339
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:10,756
- You gonna go for it? She's doin' the whole thing?!

340
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:11,706
- The whole thing?!

341
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:13,479
- Just a little bit! Just a little bit!

342
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,154
- [Collins] Wait, what?! What?!

343
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:16,675
- Oh! Why are you doing that? No!

344
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:17,630
- We have to drink this!

345
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,828
(groans of disbelief)

346
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:22,305
- Oh, Everleigh! Why'd you do that?

347
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:24,330
- You're a sneaky one! - Everleigh, you are--

348
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,547
- She is sneaky!

349
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:27,170
- You are drinking this, okay?

350
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,529
- It smells disgusting. We are almost there.

351
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,437
I think we've got one more thing left

352
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:31,821
and then we're drinking it. I'm not,

353
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:32,864
I'm not looking forward to it.
