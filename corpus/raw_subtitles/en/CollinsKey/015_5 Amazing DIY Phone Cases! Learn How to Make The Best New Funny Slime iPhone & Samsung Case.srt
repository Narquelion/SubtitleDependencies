1
00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:02,409
- For this round we're making color-changing phone cases.

2
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:03,386
- And dude, check this out.

3
00:00:03,386 --> 00:00:04,219
- What, oh, dude!

4
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,077
(screams)

5
00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:05,910
It backfired bro!

6
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,743
- Look at your face!

7
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:07,576
- There's no way it backfired.

8
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:08,409
- Yeah, look at your face.

9
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,242
- Oh, geez, no!

10
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:10,075
- Dude, yes!

11
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:10,908
- Touch my finger, touch my finger.

12
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:11,991
- What? Okay.

13
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,998
- Now I'm the magic power, dude point it at my face

14
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:15,839
- Alright.

15
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,672
- Dude.

16
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:18,013
- I wanted you to be blue forever.

17
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:19,908
- So right now let's make a color changing phone case.

18
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:21,508
- First step is we take this

19
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:23,031
base coat nail polish stuff

20
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:24,490
and you add it to this dish here.

21
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,465
- And you know I'm feeling extra strong

22
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:26,816
right now so check this out.

23
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:27,715
(yelling in deep voice)

24
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:28,548
- Oh, wow!

25
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:29,990
Whoa, hey we need that.

26
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,040
- And then check this out, you ready?

27
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,242
3, 2, 1, boom!

28
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:34,648
- Oh wow. I guess we only have one case now.

29
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:36,367
Now it's time to dump it into the dish here.

30
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,096
- Alright, just gonna dump it out, let's see here.

31
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:38,954
- What, no.

32
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:39,787
Into the dish dude.

33
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:40,620
- Oops, oh yeah.

34
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,553
You know what, I can fix this,

35
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:42,455
we'll get a little paint brush here.

36
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:44,006
This little paint brush is for precision,

37
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:45,241
so I don't need this one. Yeet!

38
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,074
I need a big one!

39
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:46,907
- There we go.

40
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:47,740
- Gonna get it all over here.

41
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,305
- You're supposed to do a very thin layer.

42
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:50,890
- What? Super thin?

43
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,723
- Yeah, that's pretty thin.

44
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:52,890
- Once the base coat is applied,

45
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,746
it's time to use this ole alien device thingy here,

46
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:55,579
where it like lights up.

47
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:56,412
What!

48
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:57,245
- Oh snap!

49
00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:59,152
- And we're going to put this thingy over the phone.

50
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:00,391
Right now I guess we're gonna let these sit for two minutes.

51
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:01,365
And hopefully nothing happens,

52
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,400
that we don't want to have happened.

53
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,516
- Next step, we take the thermo-chromic pigment

54
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:05,349
- Ow!

55
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,526
- and you mix it with this top coat nail po...

56
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:07,359
- Ow.

57
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,400
- What are you doing over there dude?

58
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,341
- Wow, this is the coolest carousel ever!

59
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:10,398
Uh oh. I should not have spun it that hard,

60
00:01:10,398 --> 00:01:11,406
wait what happens if...

61
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:12,348
- Wait, why?

62
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:13,181
(screams)

63
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:14,199
- Oh no, dude, really now?

64
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,249
- What, I didn't know what would happen.

65
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:17,015
So now I gotta pick my color, these are all kind of

66
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:18,362
razzled, dazzled and frazzled.

67
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:19,295
I'm going to put my little cup in...

68
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:20,851
- Dude, what are you doing?

69
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:21,684
- Wanna see if it'll,

70
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:22,517
- Oh, dude.

71
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:23,350
- Alright, gonna move the little carousel

72
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,499
off to the side right now.

73
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:25,332
Oh no!

74
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:26,165
- Dude that was my favorite thing.

75
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,482
- I have reflexes of an iguana.

76
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:29,315
- Are iguanas fast?

77
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:30,355
- I don't think so.

78
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:32,017
I'm the quickest of the iguana species.

79
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:34,174
- Alright, I've added half of my thermochromic pigment,

80
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:35,747
and now you add all of your top coat.

81
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:36,641
- Say that 10 times fast.

82
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:38,307
- Thermochromic pigment, thermochromic piggly

83
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,562
(jumbles words)

84
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:41,109
- (yelling jumbled words)

85
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,942
Pigment!

86
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:43,241
- Bro, you distracting me.

87
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:44,619
It's time to mix it up, is what I was going to say.

88
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:45,468
- Okay.

89
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:46,301
Oh!

90
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:47,134
- Oh, dude!

91
00:01:47,134 --> 00:01:47,967
What, really?

92
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:49,042
(sniffs)

93
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:49,875
- This stuff smells, like, like a burnt lemon.

94
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,016
- Do you cook your lemons Collins?

95
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:52,808
- I'm a chef, I like to cook things.

96
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,750
- Dude, mine looks so sweet!

97
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,025
It's already starting to change

98
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,052
colors where my fingers are at.

99
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:01,067
Next up, is we take our phone cases out of the lights,

100
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,780
we put em on here and we paint the top coat on.

101
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,992
- This one, to me, looks like the most like alien color

102
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,349
so this is why I chose this one.

103
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:08,469
And also kind of reminds me of slime.

104
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:09,545
Ya boi loves slime.

105
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:10,908
Now it's time to put the little spaceship on top.

106
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:12,346
(laser sound effects)

107
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:15,298
Now it's going to do things for like two minutes.

108
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:17,603
- It's actually changing colors already dude!

109
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:18,480
- Oh, this thing's kinda hot!

110
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,793
And now it's time for the big reveal, you ready?

111
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:20,626

112
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:21,459

The real moment of truth.

126
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,953
- Oh oh oh, yep yep yep

127
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:44,837
- Is it going to change colors?

128
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:46,334
So how bout you go with yours first, you ready?

129
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,167
- Okay, yep, I'm ready.

130
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,000
- You gotta place your hand on yours.

131
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,833
- Alright.

132
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:49,666
- Placing my hand on mine.

133
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,499
- Just gonna wait.

134
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:51,332
- Alright, here we go, the big reveal.

00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,165
You'll go first Devan.

139
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,721
- Oh, what?

140
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:58,686
- This phone case is so cool, like bro like all the time

141
00:02:58,686 --> 00:02:59,519
I'm gonna sit here, like put my

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,117
little fingerprints on it, make little,

143
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:03,022

144
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:04,235
But you get to comment down below, who's turned out cooler?

145
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:07,233
And right now we're on to the next round.

146
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,631
- For this round we're making a gumball phone case.

147
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:11,511
Dude, what, don't, bro, dude!

148
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:12,780
No, we needed that!

149
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,613
- There we go!

150
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:15,542
They weren't coming out bro, I think my machine was broken.

151
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:16,375
So um...

152
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,498
- Well cause there's almonds in there dude.

153
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,540
- For this part, here we need some...

154
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,373
- Oh!

155
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,206
- You don't wanna break...

156
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:21,701
Noooooooooooooooooooooooo!

157
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,534
- You know what?

158
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:23,367
- No!

159
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:24,200
- There you go.

160
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,033
- Relax, stop it, stop it Devan.

161
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:25,866
Bad Devan.

162
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,908
So we're gonna pop the top off right now,

163
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,308
and we don't need that one, so...yeet!

164
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:31,736
And now we just fill it up with lil ball thing.

165
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,288
Alright, so now I need to put some balls in this ball.

166
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:35,121
Lil ball!

167
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:36,700
And finally we got some orange balls.

168
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,215
Now it's time to shake up all the little

169
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:40,428
mini gumballs inside of my orbs, and we remove...

170
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,436
- Oh, I got two little gumballs in mine.

171
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:44,664
They're very inconsistent with the rest of mine.

172
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:45,892
- It's time to crazy glue this thing!

173
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,869
If you get crazy glue on your fingers,

174
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:47,745
that's not good.

175
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:49,919
Alright, precision is the name of the game.

176
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,361
- Alright, time to add my glue.

177
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,901
- Alright, now it's time to attach the ball, here we go.

178
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:53,734
Boom!

179
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,376
Well I just found out that if you remove the red top,

180
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:56,551
precision tube!

181
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,593
Dude, oh yeah, and it's gonna cover the camera

182
00:03:58,593 --> 00:03:59,973
but it's totally worth it, so here we go.

183
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,498
We're gonna get one, oh, uh oh.

184
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:02,556
Then we're gonna get another one,

185
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:03,991
two little eyeballs, plus a little nose.

186
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:04,824
What!

187
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:06,544
Next up, we have a little cup that we cut in half.

188
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:07,877
So we're gonna go over here.

189
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:09,247
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

190
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:10,142
- Gotta get this precision right.

191
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:11,406
How's this thing gonna glue to it bro?

192
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:12,574
I don't kn- , I'm really confused.

193
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:13,930
Alright, well I guess we'll let it dry.

194
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,952
- Now it's time for my favorite part, time to paint.

195
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:17,756
- This is called the, ball brush technique,

196
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:20,346
it's just what it sounds like, you use the ball as a brush.

197
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:21,909
And now, for the finishing touch on here,

198
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,367
we just gotta add some little rogue gumballs.

199
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,930
- No, you have to paint on the turning piece.

200
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,148
- Well mine isn't an advanced piece of technology

201
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:30,532
that does not require a turning piece.

202
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:31,365
Just push the gumball you want,

203
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:32,763
and it'll pop out the bottom.

204
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:34,816
- But there's like three of the same gumball on there.

205
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,640
- Just in case three people at once are like,

206
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,532
I want that one!

207
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:39,366
- Your machine is whack.

208
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,054
Yo dude, these things looks so funny.

209
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,178
- Yours looks insane.

210
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:43,303
Three...two...

211
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:44,315
- Wait, first three second like challenge.

212
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:45,319
We wanna see if you can like this

213
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,955
video in three seconds, are you ready?

214
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:47,788
Here we go!

215
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,221
Three...two...one...done!

216
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:51,090
Tada!

217
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,301
So here's the gumball...

218
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,257
- Aye, and the paint's not even dry.

219
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:55,863
- Well yeah, I can't force it to dry.

220
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,212
- Were you blowing on it?

221
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,045
- So you get to comment down below,

222
00:04:58,045 --> 00:04:59,195
who made a better gumball machine.

223
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:00,028
My favorite thing is how much it's...

224
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:00,861
- Oh, what!

225
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:02,104
- I was gonna say stuck on there.

226
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:03,585
So now the gumballs are all free.

227
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:04,787
- And I think I know who won.

228
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,719
- But right now we are on to the next round.

229
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:09,008
This round you don't ask to make an aquarium phone case.

230
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,046
Right now, let's go!

231
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:11,754
- Why are we wearing these things bro?

232
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:12,587
- Cause we're underwater!

233
00:05:12,587 --> 00:05:13,437
- We are?

234
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:14,488
- We're underwater right now.

235
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,136
- It seems like we're at the table Collins.

236
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:16,969
- No.

237
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:18,259
- I think it's just cause your glasses are foggy.

238
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,092
- Yeah, that might be it.

239
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:19,925
- Yeah, I think that's it.

240
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:20,808
- Oh, man.

241
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:21,841
- Welcome back Collins.

242
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:23,149
- They're a little foggy. Yeet!

243
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:24,225
To kick it off, we've got stickers.

244
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,058
- Oh, oh, oh

245
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,196
- Whooooo, yeet!

246
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,029
Oooops.

247
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,862
Right now we got some stickers,

248
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,600
time to create the back of the aquarium.

249
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,549
- Okay wait, so we add em to the back over here.

250
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:32,624
- The back over here.

251
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,457
- Oh.

252
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:34,290
Wait, what?

253
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,989
- My aquarium is coming along nicely.

254
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:37,177
- Dude, what sea creature is that?

255
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:38,519
- That's a plad-a-poctopus bro.

256
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,352
- Really?

257
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:41,317
- Next up, we need some sheet protectors.

258
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,187
Now it's time to cut these into smaller sheet protectors.

259
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:44,878
We now have the small page protector,

260
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,183
as well as a small sheet of parchment paper.

261
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,554
So we're gonna put this on the inside right now.

262
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:49,973
This next part here, you got to be

263
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:51,089
very, very careful.

264
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,811
We have also a larger piece of parchment paper.

265
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,173
So we're gonna put this inside like this.

266
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:57,130
And we are now going to use one of these hair dryers.

267
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,963
- Yes.

268
00:05:57,963 --> 00:05:58,996
- This is not a blow dryer.

269
00:05:58,996 --> 00:05:59,829
- No, it's not.

270
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:00,662
- You're gonna take your hair heater.

271
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:01,495
- Very carefully.

272
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,328
- Very carefully.

273
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,773
And use it to melt the plastic of the

274
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:05,050
mini page protector together.

275
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,291
Alright, there we go, it's turned off.

276
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,507
And now let's see if it worked!

277
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:08,758
- Dude, mine totally worked.

278
00:06:08,758 --> 00:06:10,083
- I did not think mine worked.

279
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,314
And now I think we remove this

280
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:12,638
little piece of paper in the middle.

281
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,224
Now look, we gotta use this thing here to get it out.

282
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:16,548
- Dude, they actually have little suction cups on each side.

283
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:17,531
It's like little plungers.

284
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:18,702
- Hold that side, hold that side

285
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:20,013
- Okay, okay, okay, got it.

286
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:20,846
Oh.

287
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:21,679
(yells in excitement)

288
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,512
Nicely done!

289
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:23,345
- Thank you, very much!

290
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:24,941
Alright, so there we go, we got that, yeet!

291
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:26,488
And now it's time to fill it up, with the water.

292
00:06:26,488 --> 00:06:27,321
Funnel time!

293
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,229
- Wait, what?

294
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,329
- So we got a large funnel here,

295
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:30,295
so we're gonna pop this in the top.

296
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:31,753
- Why not just freestyle it bro?

297
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:32,686
- I never freestyle it!

298
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:33,624
I never freestyle it!

299
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:35,045
I never freestyle it!

300
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:36,828
I never freestyle it.

301
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:37,780
- I feel like that's all you do.

302
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,613
- Pour some out.

303
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:39,722
- Oh man.

304
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:40,780
Due to my natural instincts,

305
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,246
I have a brilliant way of doing this.

306
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:43,372
We're gonna put the funnel up here,

307
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:45,418
bottom part down over here, like this.

308
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:46,671
So now we're gonna pour the water in.

309
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:47,712
(blowing)

310
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:48,545
Add some air pressure to it.

311
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:49,887
I'm gonna try to get it in here...

312
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,877
- Aye dude, you know what, I'm just gonna help you out here.

313
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:53,469
- Ah, thank you man, I appreciate it.

314
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:54,302
- Gotta get it open here.

315
00:06:54,302 --> 00:06:56,242
- You ready? Three...two...one!

316
00:06:56,242 --> 00:06:57,857
- Oh wait, oh dude!

317
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:58,961
Bro!

318
00:06:58,961 --> 00:06:59,794
My ear!

319
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,977
Dude!

320
00:07:00,977 --> 00:07:01,817
- I'm so sorry!

321
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:02,973
Well as the old saying goes,

322
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,735
"With a great noodle comes great responsibility",

323
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:06,159
So I'm just gonna put this on the side right now.

324
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:06,992
- Bro, I am soaking wet.

325
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:07,825
You want a hug?

326
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:08,916
- No, no, no, no.

327
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:09,749
- There's your hug.

328
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:10,582
- No, no, no!

329
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:11,415
- There you go!

330
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:12,943
- The real question, Devan, did you hold the bag steady?

331
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:13,776
- Really!

332
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:14,609
- Alright...

333
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:15,506
- You made me drop my pouch too dude.

334
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:16,730
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa

335
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,770
- Sharing is caring.

336
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,802
- Now you're taking my water!

337
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:20,243
- Dude, you have so much water all over you,

338
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:21,466
just ring out your shirt bro.

339
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:22,324
Alright, here we go, we're just gonna

340
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:23,165
pour this little bit in there.

341
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,473
Ooooooo, I wanna add a sharky to mine.

342
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,001
- It's all soggy.

343
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,195
The sticker is soggy.

344
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:28,028
- Haha!

345
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:29,101
- Next up, now we gotta add a little

346
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:30,743
aquatic fishies into it so I'm gonna go

347
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:34,270
for a great white, Megalodon shark.

348
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,770
He's now in.

349
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,847
Oh no, wait!

350
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:37,680
No, the blue dye,

351
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,779
the blue dye is actually working in the water, whoa!

352
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:40,683
- Can you help me out?

353
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:41,516
- Yeah, so sorry.

354
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:43,049
- Thank you, that didn't really help.

355
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:44,321
- I think my bag is leaking bro.

356
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:46,248
Our aquarium cannot have a breach in its security.

357
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:47,344
Next up, we got the baby oil.

358
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:48,239
How do you open this?

359
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,219
I think it's like, Collins proof.

360
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,379
- Uh, I think it's baby proof Collins, but yeah.

361
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,212
- How'd you do that?

362
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:53,045
- Tada!

363
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:53,878
- Oh here we go, got it! Oh whoops.

364
00:07:53,878 --> 00:07:55,466
Okay, so now I guess we fill up the rest

365
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:56,412
of it with baby oil I was gonna go,

366
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,434
right about there.

367
00:07:58,434 --> 00:07:59,267
- Alright.

368
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,100
- Next up, we got the tape.

369
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,624
So just gonna grab a little bit off right now.

370
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:03,071
It's not cutting at all.

371
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,599
- Probably because it's super soggy!

372
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:05,587
- Well, I'm out of tape.

373
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:06,696
Can I borrow some of yours Devan, please?

374
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:07,529
- No, you cannot!

375
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,362
- Where's your tape at?

376
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,259
- It's nowhere.

377
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:10,790
You can use it after me Collins, you can use it after me.

378
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,739
- Thank you, that's very kind of you Devan.

379
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:12,572
- You're welcome.

380
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:13,968
- Got it, and then now we're gonna put it on here,

381
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:14,871
over here, like this, and then peel it off.

382
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,385
I have a better idea!

383
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,821
Take your phone case, take your aquarium,

384
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:20,882
and then you take your funnel, put the phone in the funnel

385
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:23,284
so now you can just talk, and you can be listening

386
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:24,556
on the phone over here, like hey, what's up?

387
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:25,569
And then when it's your turn to talk,

388
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:26,573
You can turn the funnel around, and be like,

389
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,406
wuddup mom?

390
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,843
Cause that like the only person that ever calls me.

391
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:29,808
- It just doesn't even stick.

392
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,037
- I feel with you, you have to be

393
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:31,870
a lot more careful than we were.

394
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,901
Do not get baby oil every where.

395
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:35,711
- The real note is not to get water everywhere.

396
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:37,177
- Oh dude, oh bro!

397
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:38,539
- Alright, time to reveal it, you ready?

398
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,746
Three...two...

399
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:42,154
Wait, first, if you want to win a 15 minute video call

400
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:46,211
with Devan and I, text "DIY" to 81800 right now.

401
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:49,147
So pause the video, text "DIY" to 81800

402
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:51,317
and you'll be automatically be entered in to win.

403
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:52,900
- Comment down below, who you think won this round.

404
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,384
- Exactly, and how do you think we should attach it

405
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:57,464
to the phone in the future, cause we can't figure it out.

406
00:08:57,464 --> 00:08:58,297
Oh snap!

407
00:08:58,297 --> 00:08:59,372
One of you guys challenged us,

408
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,093
to make a snack pouch for your phone case.

409
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:02,179
Right now, let's go!

410
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:03,400
Oh snap, whoa!

411
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,908
So first up, we gotta cut out the pouch.

412
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:07,842
But for me, I'm just gonna use my trusty dusty fingers.

413
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:08,801
- Your trusty dusty?

414
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:09,791
- Not dusty!

415
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,867
Very clean fingers, no dust, yeet!

416
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:12,710
Side number one, yeet!

417
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,466
Pouch side number two, there we go.

418
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,209
And now it's just time to att...

419
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:17,233
(laughter)

420
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:18,130
- What are you laughing about?

421
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,576
- Just the way that mine turned out.

422
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,213
- I have traced mine, now it's time to cut it out.

423
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:22,892
- My case is done, I'm just gonna hold it in place

424
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:24,242
like this instead of gluing it,

425
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:25,628
because I don't trust glue ever!

426
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:27,117
Just gonna hold it like this forever, bro.

427
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:28,872
- That's quite a promise you have there.

428
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:29,705
- Oh, bro, trust me!

429
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:30,652
- What if we wanna play ping pong?

430
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:31,739
- That's gonna be an issue.

431
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,719
I'll play with my mouth.

432
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:34,994
- Alright, I've painted my phone case,

433
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:36,502
now it is time to paint the cut-out.

434
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:38,860
- Want to point out, you have yet to catch me slippin.

435
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,991
- Alright, the cut-out is painted, now it's time to

436
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:42,912
fold the edges, and put it on to the phone case.

437
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:45,058
And just like that, our phone cases are done.

438
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:46,308
- Yep, and now it's time to figure out

439
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,584
what snacks we should add.

440
00:09:47,584 --> 00:09:50,133
Celery, slices of apple, sauce of apples,

441
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,099
strawberries, strawberry sauce, peanuts.

442
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,434
So you can comment down below, oh snap,

443
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:55,017
who made the better phone case snack pouch.

444
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:56,982
And right now, we're on to the next one.

445
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:58,433
New challenge, we're gonna make a phone case

446
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,720
as a stress reliever, so right now, let's go.

447
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,895
So for this, we're gonna be making

448
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,251
elephant slime, yeet!

449
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:04,892
And so what I mean by elephant slime,

450
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:05,834
is we're gonna use this little elephant,

451
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:06,925
a cute little thingy, bro.

452
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:08,037
You're not making elephant slime Devan,

453
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:09,286
you're making regular boring slime.

454
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:11,155
First comes first, glue is in, easy.

455
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:13,134
Next up, we got a handy dandy shaving cream.

456
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,189
So we gotta get this open now.

457
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:16,008
To get this open, we got to use my

458
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:17,688
little helper over here, my little friend.

459
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:19,605
There we go, see, teamwork makes the dream work.

460
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:20,557
There we go!

461
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:22,895
- That might be too much bro, I hate to say it but.

462
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:25,143
- Gonna pop this in here, and I guess we just mix it up.

463
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:27,130
Elephant time takes a little bit more slime, but what?

464
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,957
Elephant slime takes a little bit more time.

465
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:30,568
Alright, it's gotten super creamy now,

466
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:33,028
and time to add in the Sta-Flo, so here we go.

467
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,369
We're gonna take this over here, like this

468
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,444
and of course we gotta use the finger of fury,

469
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:37,340
to get it in there, so here we go.

470
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,372
The finger of fury, and then you use the thumb

471
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,618
to leverage it over like that.

472
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:42,685
- Wow, alright, that's pretty cool.

473
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:43,843
- Yo, this feels like marshmallow fluff.

474
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,995
Mr. L's doing a great job mixing up the slime.

475
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:47,123
His name is Mr. L.

476
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:48,222
- Mine is not turning out.

477
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:49,055
- You know what you need?

478
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:49,888
- What?

479
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:51,450
- You need the silver ball of destiny.

480
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,703
- Yeah, okay.

481
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:53,809
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

482
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:54,642
How'd you do that?

483
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:55,902
I gotta go for the hand over hand over hands.

484
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:58,131
- See, it's because I didn't make elephant slime.

485
00:10:58,131 --> 00:11:00,734
I made, general, regular old boring slime.

486
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,034
- Booooooooooo.

487
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,203
- Now that my slime is done,

488
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:04,973
it's time to add it into the wubble bubble.

489
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:07,409
- It's elephant slime, it's time to do something different.

490
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,624
You gotta use the roller of, yeah!

491
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:10,534
Yeah!

492
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:11,367
- Yeah!

493
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,200
- Yeah!

494
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,061
- Gotta use my two talon fingers...

495
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:15,099
- Wait, your two what?

496
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:16,391
- My two talented fingers.

497
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:17,224
- Oh, I thought you said talon fingers.

498
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:18,815
- Nope, nope, I said talented...

499
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:19,648
- Bird?

500
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:21,339
- Dude! Look at that!

501
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:22,980
- Work with me, I wanna be that.

502
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,813
You can be that too.

503
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:25,093
- Put it on the phone case here,

504
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:27,583
take one of these, that you have cut open

505
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,226
and you put it around it, and done.

506
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:31,151
- Wait, you're fully done?

507
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:32,434
I'm going about it a different way.

508
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:33,610
I don't think it's going in.

509
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,468
- Well, you know...

510
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:35,414
- There's a little bit of stuff...

511
00:11:35,414 --> 00:11:36,599
- Just hold my...wow

512
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:37,678
- Yours doesn't do that.

513
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:39,102
- Bro, you're seeming extremely stressed

514
00:11:39,102 --> 00:11:40,320
out right now, I think you just

515
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,926
need to squeeze this once or twice,

516
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:42,929
and you'll be all set.

517
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:44,281
Oh, nope, maybe not.

518
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:45,131
- What, what's wrong, oh.

519
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:46,122
- But your hands dude.

520
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,613
- Take the slime, put it on the phone case like this.

521
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:49,123
Now whenever you answer a call, you're like

522
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:50,167
ring ring, hello.

523
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,705
You get to comment down below, who made a better

524
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:53,412
stress relieving phone case, right now.

525
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,917
Yeah, I gotta give it up on mine.

526
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,380
This is gonna go back into the elephant bowl.

527
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,973
And right now, we're on to the next one.

528
00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,506
Bro, I'm about to turn you into a minion

529
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:01,455
with a minion voice changer 3000 right here, you ready?

530
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,288
- Okay, yeah.

531
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,121
Three, two, one.

532
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,669
(mumbling)

533
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:07,531
- (mumbles in high pitch voice)

534
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:08,364
My voice!

535
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:11,266
- You guys challenged us to create a huge minion phone case.

536
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:12,594
So right now, let's go!

537
00:12:12,594 --> 00:12:14,001
- Wait bro, can you change my voice back?

538
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,017
- Boom, there we go!

539
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:15,850
- Oh, oh, it's back!

540
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,683
Yeah!

541
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:17,815
- You'll need blue fabric.

542
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:19,589
- Blue, yeah, blue fabric.

543
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:20,772
- Yellow fabric.

544
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:21,605
Black fabric.

545
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:22,643
So, then you're gonna wanna cut

546
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:23,682
these up into these shapes.

547
00:12:23,682 --> 00:12:25,699
- The first shape is a small boat.

548
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:27,017
- And lovely mustache.

549
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:28,977
- Swiss cheese, but with only one hole.

550
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:30,625
- Next up, we have the almost square.

551
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,458
- It's almost a square.

552
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,618
And now it's time to assemble the minion.

553
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,676
So we gotta get some lining around it.

554
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:36,261
And now, we gotta put this on here.

555
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:37,260
Let's see if I can nail the precision.

556
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,956
Now I got time for little overall straps.

557
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,327
- Oh no, the glue is falling off.

558
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,160
- Bam!

559
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,605
I'm crushing this thing right now.

560
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:43,647
- I should've done it your way.

561
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,226
- Usually I'm not better than Devan at these things,

562
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:47,004
but this time, taking home the W.

563
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:48,007
No L's today.

564
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:48,973
Gonna put the pocket down.

565
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,121
And last but not least, we got of course,

566
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:51,525
gotta put on the strap for the eyeballs.

567
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:53,035
- So much glue every where.

568
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:56,391
The two fabrics rubbed together, and ugh, ew.

569
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:57,844
Now it's time for the overalls, ugh!

570
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,744
- So we're gonna lift it up, and then drop it on.

571
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:00,999
It's very important you get the camera hole properly.

572
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,246
- Alright, alright, alright.

573
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,596
- Now, time for the most important part, the eyes.

574
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:06,812
My guy's gonna have three, four, five, six eyes.

575
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:08,556
- Alright, now it's time to add the googly eyes.

576
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:10,098
- Mine's got six, how many does yours have?

577
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:11,497
- One, a little off to the left.

578
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:12,330
- What?

579
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,326
He's not even gonna have a fidget spinner one?

580
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,208
That's the whole point of this,

581
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,188
is to create fidget spinner eyes,

582
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:16,728
so you can spin his eyes around.

583
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:18,037
- Oh, alright, sure.

584
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:19,312
Orange, eye fidget spinner.

585
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:21,209
Now it's time to add the googly eyes,

586
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,325
and we're still only gonna do one eye,

587
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:24,668
a little bit off to the left.

588
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:25,501
- Done, okay.

589
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,787
So now I gotta transport this to the minion.

590
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:28,803
Boom! There we go!

591
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:30,304
Fidget spinner's on, the eyes are done.

592
00:13:30,304 --> 00:13:32,424
So here it is, these are our completed minions.

593
00:13:32,424 --> 00:13:34,553
They did not turn out as well as I thought they would.

594
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:35,398
- No, not at all.

595
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,231
- You spin it...

596
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:37,064
- Yeah!

597
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:38,390
- With the eyes spin on it, that's pretty cool for me.

598
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,429
- Mines getting stuck, and oh no, the eye came off.

599
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,147
- You get to comment down below, who made a better one.

600
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,472
Right now, we're on to the next one.

601
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:44,314
Oh!

602
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:45,534
- Oh, hey, Burt the minion bro!

603
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,476
- Oh my gosh!

604
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:47,370
- Oh!

605
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,360
- You challenged us,

606
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,193
oh my God!

607
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:50,026
- What was that?

608
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:50,859
- So we got a phone case, which is also

609
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:52,035
a wallet, out of duct tape.

610
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:52,868
- Dude.

611
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:53,701
- So right now, let's do it.

612
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:54,534
Take this side over here.

613
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,367
- Okay, alright.

614
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,249
- Go, go, go, go, go.

615
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:57,317
- And stop, gotta karate chop it off.

616
00:13:57,317 --> 00:13:58,334
That didn't work.

617
00:13:58,334 --> 00:13:59,167
- That did not work.

618
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,368
- So we're gonna start with making the duct tape wallet...

619
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:01,201
- Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.

620
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:02,323
That's my duct tape.

621
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:04,080
I got a very clear idea how my duct tape wallet

622
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,516
is gonna turn out, I used to make these a while ago.

623
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:07,821
And I ripped it in half already.

624
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:09,629
You know what, it's all part of the game plan.

625
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,344
Devan, can you grab that side for me?

626
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:12,177
- What, really?

627
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:13,010
- Keep goin, keep goin, keep goin.

628
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,843
- Okay, okay, okay.

629
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:14,676
- Keep goin, keep goin, keep goin,

630
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:15,509
- Okay, okay.

631
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:16,342
- And stop right there.

632
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:17,175
- Alright perfect, thank you.

633
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:18,008
- Oops, it's getting a little bit tangled.

634
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:18,841
A little purse.

635
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,551
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's my friend duck!

636
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:22,114
- Three, two , one.

637
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:24,299
We need the orange tape, cause you wanna

638
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:25,491
make sure that if you ever lose your wallet,

639
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:26,896
or drop it, you can immediately find it.

640
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:28,271
So for this, you're gonna wanna wrap it around

641
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:29,501
the circumference of a duck.

642
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,204
This is duct tape, and you gotta have a duck for it.

643
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,228
Cause it's a duct tape wallet.

644
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:34,770
Cut it out here, oh, that was almost close.

645
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,831
- It was almost close, it wasn't even close.

646
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:37,664
- Alright, so here we go.

647
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:39,318
So gonna squeeze my duck, come on out dude.

648
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:41,110
Boom, there we go, yeet!

649
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,438
- I think you just dented the wall.

650
00:14:43,438 --> 00:14:44,271
- Alright, so here we go.

651
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:45,493
This is now the little bottom pouch,

652
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,166
and I just need to seal off the bottom.

653
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,240
We're just gonna take a little while,

654
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,472
so right now let's fast forward to the very end.

655
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,305
- Dude!

656
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:51,351
- Well here it is, time for the big reveal.

657
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:53,495
Dude, that thing look so cool, and it's functional.

658
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:54,676
So right now, here we go!

659
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:55,960
Three, two, one.

660
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,793
Tada!

661
00:14:56,793 --> 00:14:58,058
Dude, these are these are so cool!

662
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:00,237
- It actually works, bro, look at that!

663
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:01,070
- What?

664
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,431
- And, you can store some money.

665
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:04,564
- Well you got money bro, all I got was a duck.

666
00:15:04,564 --> 00:15:05,397
- Wait, what?

667
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:06,348
- This is not fair at all.

668
00:15:06,348 --> 00:15:07,571
You may be wondering where the phone case is,

669
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:08,824
but the thing is, I don't need a phone case.

670
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,657
You know why?

671
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:10,632
Cause I don't need a phone to communicate.

672
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:11,715
I just got rubber ducks,

673
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:12,828
rubber ducks are all you need in life.

674
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,452
So right now you get to comment down below,

675
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:16,319
who made a better phone wallet, out of duct tape.

676
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,037
- Alright, I made another one that actually works,

677
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:19,831
because I will not accept defeat.

678
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,081
- Dude, that thing looks so good!

679
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:22,586
Three, two , one.

680
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:23,485
Tada!

681
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:24,435
- It actually works.

682
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:25,384
- I can't believe that's like,

683
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,242
what it's supposed to look like.

684
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:27,580
- Alright, we're at the end of the video,

685
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,997
and I'm actually kind of thirsty, Collins.

686
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:30,155
Do you have any water by chance?

687
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:31,674
- Yeah, actually we got a water bottle phone case.

688
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:33,514
A bonus phone case right here, bro.

689
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:34,407
So, alright, take a drink.

690
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:35,240
- Alright, yeah.

691
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,073
- Wait, wait, first, sorry I just got a text message

692
00:15:36,073 --> 00:15:36,906
I gotta take care of this first.

693
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:37,739
- Um, okay?

694
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:38,572
- Alright, we love you guys.

695
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:39,405
Bye!

696
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,905
(dance music)
