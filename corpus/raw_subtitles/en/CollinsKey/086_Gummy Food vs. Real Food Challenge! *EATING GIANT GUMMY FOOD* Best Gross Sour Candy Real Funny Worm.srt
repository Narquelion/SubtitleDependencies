1
00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:01,982
- Dude this thing is so- - Bro!

2
00:00:01,982 --> 00:00:03,483
- Whooping heavy! (beep)

3
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:06,158
- [Both] Three, two, one, ahhh!

4
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:06,991
- I got a gummy rat!

5
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:08,462
- Oh no dude what's under here?

6
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:09,295
- Oh no!

7
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:10,378
- [Both] Ahh!

8
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:13,573
- Is that a real rat?

9
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:15,786
- Yo dude, it's a remote controlled rat.

10
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:17,072
- [Man In Gray Shirt] That looks disgusting.

11
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:18,132
- Bro, This is the most

12
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:20,241
wrinkly gummy I've ever seen.

13
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,737
- [Man in Gray] It looks like a rat.

14
00:00:21,737 --> 00:00:23,262
- It looks like a real rat.

15
00:00:23,262 --> 00:00:24,485
- Oh but wait, where's the remote at?

16
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:25,318
- That sounded so bad.

17
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:26,744
- Geeze alright here it is, hold on.

18
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:27,748
Oh geeze no no no no no.

19
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:29,301
I'm actually happy I don't have to eat anything this time

20
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:30,160
- Oh look at that.

21
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,580
It's all like cracked and everything.

22
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,413
- [Both] Ugh!

23
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:33,811
- Should I go for it just now?

24
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:34,644
- Yeah, yeah, of course. - Alight cool, I'm gonna-

25
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:37,523
(gummy chewing)

26
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:38,356
Ugh!

27
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:39,656
- What? Let me try this.

28
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:40,876
I'm gonna go for the head.

29
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:41,804
- It tastes weird.

30
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:43,035
I don't know how to describe it.

31
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:44,003
- What the hey?

32
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:45,047
- It's not good.

33
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:46,700
- Ew, like almost like has

34
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,435
a sewer rat taste to it.

35
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:49,589
Like I don't know what that tastes like

36
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:50,781
but it just tastes like that.

37
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:51,851
- It's weird.

38
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,366
- I wonder if that like actually has rat in it.

39
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,807
- Well,the pickle had pickle juice in it so.

40
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:56,640
- I got to spit it out.

41
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,734
- Oh yeah we gotta go spit it out.

42
00:00:57,734 --> 00:00:58,642
Oh my god. (Beep)

43
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,659
For this round Devon you can either

44
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,890
keep em or switch em,

45
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,723
so what do you wanna do right now?

46
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:03,757
- I wanna make the decision of keeping it.

47
00:01:03,757 --> 00:01:04,590
- Positive?

48
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,423
- Yeah sure, yeah.

49
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:07,997
- Alright here we go. - [Both] Three two one.

50
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:09,938
(excited shouting and laughter)

51
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:11,535
I think it's gonna break the plate.

52
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:12,707
- I thought the whole table broke.

53
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:14,224
- Dude! They're little tiny little brains.

54
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:15,925
- [Devon] Whoa! Dude, that's a massive brain.

55
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:18,047
- Yo, this is perfect we can use this as

56
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:18,880
like a loaf of bread for the sandwich.

57
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,938
- Ooooh!

58
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:20,771
Just cut it in half.

59
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:21,604
- But you can cut it in half.

60
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:22,463
- That's a great idea.

61
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:23,363
- We're gonna be eating

62
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:24,425
the largest gummy sandwich

63
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,150
in the entire world at the end of this video,

64
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,242
so make sure you stick around for that.

65
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:28,105
We'll I'm excited.

66
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,267
- I wanna try one of these.

67
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:30,320
- But that's my gummy.

68
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,344
- (laughs) I missed anyway.

69
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:32,204
- That's my gummy.

70
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:33,070
- Bro is it good?

71
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,610
- Dude like I think I'm getting smarter

72
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,877
because of these. It's so delicious.

73
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:38,143
- Alright so before we cut it in half,

74
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:40,203
I am actually gonna get it off the plate.

75
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:41,528
- Holy cow.

76
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:42,378
- And then I'm gonna eat--

77
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:43,211
What are you doing?

78
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:44,775
- Trying to balance on my nose.

79
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:46,209
- Oooh!

80
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,168
- It's so good.

81
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:48,151
It tastes like cherry.

82
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,906
It doesn't taste like a brain at all,

83
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:52,054
not that I'd know what a brain tastes like.

84
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:52,887
- Whoops.

85
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:53,780
- How is that going over there?

86
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,613
- Not good.

87
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:55,995
I can balance on my forehead.

88
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:57,054
I'm a little unicorn.

89
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:57,887
- Bro, how are we gonna cut it?

90
00:01:57,887 --> 00:01:58,720
- (screeches) oh man

91
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,319
- How we gonna cut it?

92
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,929
- If you do this at home please be careful.

93
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:03,905
- You should not do that.

94
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,719
Parental supervision this is

95
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,256
not a smart idea.

96
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:08,089
- Oh my gosh.

97
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:08,922
Holy cow. - Bro what are you doing?

98
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:09,755
I'm nervous.

99
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:10,594
Why are you doing this?

100
00:02:10,594 --> 00:02:12,260
- (screeches) It's so difficult.

101
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,164
Look it didn't even make it

102
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:14,378
all the way through yet.

103
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:15,389
This is so difficult man.

104
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:16,577
Okay I gotta say - Be careful.

105
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:17,826
- As an idea for a loaf of bread,

106
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,492
not the smartest. (Beep)

107
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:20,414
We couldn't figure out how

108
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:21,375
to cut this thing in half

109
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,804
but luckily somehow our dad cracked

110
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:23,771
the math on the whole thing.

111
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:24,749
- Yeah how did he do it?

112
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:25,781
- Now we have two separate halves

113
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:27,037
so this is going to be the bread

114
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:29,179
and the first ingredient is the gummy rat.

115
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:30,851
This is a good kind of base here.

116
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,053
- Ugh. I would say it didn't have to be added.

117
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:33,304
- Ew, ew that's so gross.

118
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:34,137
And then we'll kinda add

119
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:35,058
little gummy brains in there.

120
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:35,891
- Nice.

121
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:37,541
- And we are making the largest gummy sandwich

122
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,374
in the entire world

123
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:39,562
with all these different foods.

124
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:41,158
- Perhaps the only gummy sandwich.

125
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:42,018
- This is probably gonna

126
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:43,548
be the most delicious sandwich of all time.

127
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:44,666
I am like could not be more excited.

128
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,574
Where does this go? Boop!

129
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:46,407
Right over there.

130
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:47,711
Move that off to the side.

131
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:48,834
We're popping this over there.

132
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:49,963
Yeah! - No!

133
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:51,629
You can not do that. - Yeah

134
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,831
- This is a glass bowl.

135
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:54,317
That is a wood floor.

136
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:55,213
- I can't wait to see

137
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:56,508
what other ingredients we get

138
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:57,971
to put on our gummy sandwich.

139
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,311
Hopefully none of them are gross.

140
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:01,254
But right now lets go to the next one.

141
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:02,515
- Alright Collin it is your turn,

142
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,974
do you wanna keep it or switch it?

143
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:06,130
- Bro you know me, I'm always saying spontaneous.

144
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,122
I wanna switch it.

145
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:08,063
- Okay. - Yup.

146
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:08,896
I wanna switch it.

147
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:09,729
There we go.

148
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,143
Here we go. - Alright.

149
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:11,976
Ready, one or three - Three

150
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:13,268
[Both] Two one.

151
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:14,851
Yeah, wait hold up.

152
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,822
You don't have anything.

153
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,655
- I have nothing.

154
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,488
- What happened?

155
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:19,715
- Ahh, ahhh!

156
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:20,829
- What the--

157
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,662
- What was that?

158
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:23,917
(slow motion screaming)

159
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:24,968
- Hit me in the face.

160
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:26,991
- Oh my gosh, holy cow!

161
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:27,857
- Oh!

162
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:29,660
- I bet you that my heart stopped.

163
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,535
- Bro. - Oh my gosh I saw em

164
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:33,074
they're bats and then oh my gosh.

165
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:35,079
My heart is beating so fast right now.

166
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,882
That was like it this thing came out of nowhere.

167
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:37,898
I felt something hit the side of my head.

168
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:39,345
(slow motion screaming)

169
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,777
I have a lot I gotta process.

170
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:41,989
- Have a gummy for consolation.

171
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,009
There you go.

172
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:44,246
- Oh. - Eat another one.

173
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:45,585
- Yo. - You need it.

174
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:46,665
You deserve it.

175
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:47,697
- Oh man these are nice.

176
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:48,931
Dude it looks like a little bat.

177
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:49,764
- It does dude.

178
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:50,778
- I wonder what it tastes like though.

179
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:52,588
I mean it's gummy food where it's a real food.

180
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:53,614
And this is like a real food but--

181
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:56,331
- Dude it's plastic. Bro!

182
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:57,606
No, what?

183
00:03:57,606 --> 00:04:00,117
Bro, it's hard rubber and plastic.

184
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:00,950
- I think I like threw my neck out.

185
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,783
(both laugh)

186
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,086
(chewing)

187
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:04,315
This thing's pretty intense so--

188
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:05,148
- Yeah well we're not--

189
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:06,742
(Screams)

190
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:08,303
Ow! - I'm so sorry!

191
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:09,339
- Bro! - I'm so sorry!

192
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:10,307
- That is sharp.

193
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:11,715
It's hard plastic.

194
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,574
- It's got little teeth.

195
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:13,545
Oh that's so dumb.

196
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,378
I apologize.

197
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:16,079
- It already hit me in the face before.

198
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,672
Why did you just chuck it really hard at my face.

199
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:18,536
- I'm not afraid of this bat.

200
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:20,021
Where'd it go?

201
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,102
- I'm glad it's gone.

202
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:22,230
Alright Devon, do you wanna keep em

203
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,188
or switch em?

204
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:24,554
- You know what, last time was great.

205
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:25,541
So I'm gonna keep it.

206
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,374
- Yeah my heart still pounding

207
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:27,313
after I switched it last time.

208
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:28,398
So we'll go with that. - Alright.

209
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:30,248
[Both] Three, two, one.

210
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:32,803
Yeah! - This is awesome!

211
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,078
- Yay we both got awesome ones.

212
00:04:34,078 --> 00:04:35,173
- Dude, wait.

213
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:36,161
Gummy candy corn?

214
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:36,994
- Whoa.

215
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:38,455
- I'm kinda concerned though cause of this coating.

216
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:39,948
It looks like sour coating.

217
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:41,955
Do they make sour candy corn?

218
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:42,813
- They better not.

219
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:44,054
(dramatic sound effect)

220
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:44,887
(smacking)

221
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:45,882
No reaction so I think we're good.

222
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,032
- Dude it tastes like sugar.

223
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:47,865
- Is it good, yeah? - It's just sugar.

224
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:48,698
- Can I try it?

225
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:50,055
Whoa, it's like a marshmallow.

226
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:51,322
- Like a marshmallow. - Bro.

227
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:52,852
- Like a multi layer marshmallow.

228
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:54,215
- Wait let's try em both together.

229
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:55,048
- Together?

230
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:56,048
- Mm, mm hm.

231
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:58,991
It's like gum.

232
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,034
You can't even say anything.

233
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:04,867
- Chubby bunny.

234
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:05,967
(both laugh)

235
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:06,800
- Look at that.

236
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,817
That's so cool.

237
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:08,798
- It's gonna actually really fun

238
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:09,659
to decorate the sandwich

239
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:10,639
because I wanna put some of these

240
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,922

241
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:13,330
- And kind of like shove 'em in.

242
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,721
- What? - Like little studs.

243
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:15,611
- They're like teeth.

244
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,691
- There definitely not gonna be much in man

245
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,717
cause they're just like popping right out.

246
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,550
- I know, dude you're like doing all

247
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,429
of this work for nothing.

248
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:20,807
- Well wax, wax they're looking kinda cool.

249
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:21,795
- They're all popping out.

250
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:23,251
- Yo, lets lets do this.

251
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:24,084
Really?

252
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:25,500
Dude, look at this.

253
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,833
We're giving the rat a new head.

254
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,016
- What? - He gotta candy corn head.

255
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,064
Alright boom there we go.

256
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:30,563
Devon your decision right now.

257
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,884
Do you wanna keep em or switch em?

258
00:05:31,884 --> 00:05:33,469
- I've been so good with the keep that

259
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:34,841
I'm just gonna switch em.

260
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:35,866
- Switch em.

261
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:36,764
- Yeah I knew it.

262
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:37,814
- Alright lets go, lets go.

263
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:38,647
I know it's gonna get ugly--

264
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:39,503
- Oh this is gonna be fantastic.

265
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:40,336
- I know this is gonna turn out bad if

266
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:41,268
I just keep on keeping em

267
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:42,318
so I'm gonna switch em.

268
00:05:42,318 --> 00:05:43,984
- [Both] Three two one.

269
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:46,475
Yeah! - That is awesome!

270
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:47,711
- They're gummy teeth.

271
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:49,791
- No way, bro I got some real fangs.

272
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,913
- Yeah but can you eat your fangs?

273
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:52,373
- Yeah what's up dude?

274
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:53,790
Yeah I can watch.

275
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:57,993
- Your gonna choke.

276
00:05:57,993 --> 00:05:58,935
Don't eat your fangs.

277
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:00,729
- My fangs have fangs.

278
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:01,979
- Really? - Ahh!

279
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,791
- I want to suck your blood.

280
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,624
- You wanna what?

281
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:08,748
- I wanna try a tongue twister.

282
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:10,664
Peter Piper picked a pair of pickled peppers.

283
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:11,497
A pack of pickle pepper Peter Piper picked.

284
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:14,497
Peter Piper picked most blue pickles

285
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:16,551
I wanna try these now.

286
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,534
What's up dude?

287
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:18,859
Then you go like this.

288
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:20,033
You go like what's up dude?

289
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,683
- You look like a weird dog.

290
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:24,519
(growling)

291
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,397
Woo wooey wait.

292
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,821
What about a tooth mustache?

293
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,821
(laugh)

294
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:32,679
- You okay?

295
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,527
- I feel like an old person with dentures man.

296
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:36,632
Just like just coughing up.

297
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:37,693
Line it around the perimeter.

298
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:38,788
- Oh yeah that's a good idea.

299
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:39,849
- It's a very scary sandwich man.

300
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,604
You bite the sandwich the sandwich bites back.

301
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:43,383
- It's the most Halloween sandwich ever.

302
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:47,050
- Alright guys lets go on to the next round.

303
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:50,652
Even though mine looks kinda suss right now--

304
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:52,078
- Very suspicious. - Very suspicious.

305
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,029
I don't think I want to switch it.

306
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:55,720
Three. - [Both] Two one.

307
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,588
Wait wait wait wait.

00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:21,331
(laughs) I got a gummy...wait

320
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:22,353
- Wait a second.

321
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:23,279
- Hold up.

322
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,483
- There's no way. No way!

323
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:25,574
- There's no way, right?

324
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:27,064
- I know I need to open it

325
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:27,897
but I'm scared.

326
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:29,122
- There's not gonna be anything in there.

327
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:29,955
- Yeah - There's not.

328
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:30,988
- Three, two one.

329
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,560
Ahh!

330
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,164
- No, no! (continued screaming)

331
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,363
(slow motion scream)

332
00:07:36,363 --> 00:07:38,209
There was an actual spider!

333
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,042
- No way.

334
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,057
Oh my gosh.

335
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:43,876
Dude, that is terrifying!

336
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:44,873
Holy cow.

337
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:45,931
- It just scared me now.

338
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:46,947
- Oh my gosh bro.

339
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:48,328
It like pops out at you.

340
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:50,002
And the legs are all rubbery.

341
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,844
- I thought it was moving cause the legs are

342
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:53,844
like all wiggling and jiggling.

343
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,052
- Oh my gosh.

344
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:56,469
Look how intense this experience is.

345
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:57,390
You ready?

346
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,231
Here's your hand.

347
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,593
- Y'all know I'm terrified of spiders too.

348
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:03,608
- And I was waiting for it to be like plot twist.

349
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,594
Like you think that's it

350
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:06,466
and there's actually like a real spider inside of it.

351
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:07,299
- That's what I was thinking.

352
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,764
- Bro I need a minute.

353
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:10,617
So I guess we got some gummy spiders here.

354
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:12,577
- This one looks really, really gross.

355
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:13,646
- So lets put that one on the sandwich.

356
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:14,867
- And from my experience with the rat,

357
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,084
it's not gonna be good.

358
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:17,368
So I'm goin for this one.

359
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:18,319
- Dude my heart is still beating so fast.

360
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,546
First the bat then the spider.

361
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:22,616
You biting it? - Mmhmm

362
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:23,597
So good.

363
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:24,430
- What the heck?

364
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,235
(Screeches)

365
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:27,472
So lets go to the next round.

366
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:28,920
- You always chuck something in my face.

367
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,369
- So Devon this one here looks

368
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,386
a little bit funky. - Yeah.

369
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,752
- And last time it was like a box of fear

370
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:33,585
so if you wanna keep 'em or switch 'em.

371
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:35,893
- Oh I know. I'm definitely switching them.

372
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:38,109
- What? - I'm not excited for that.

373
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:39,222
- Ready? - I'm ready.

374
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:42,120
- [Both] Three, two, one.

375
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,953
Yeah!

376
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:45,483
- It's a pumpkin.

377
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,705
Dude it's got face paint on it.

378
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:48,245
- You gotta eat it though. - I can do that.

379
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:50,073
- Alright while you try to crack that open

380
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:51,158
I'm gonna have mine.

381
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:52,264
- I wonder if that tastes like pumpkin.

382
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:54,371
- Oh wait, oh wait, hold up.

383
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:55,402
- What?

384
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,305
- Why is it sour?

385
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:57,201
- It's sour?

386
00:08:57,201 --> 00:09:00,477
- Uh huh. - Maybe you got the wrong one.

387
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:02,889
- It tastes like, you know, the fruit the Cutie

388
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:04,274
but really sour one.

389
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:05,284
I'm not kidding.

390
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:06,599
Why, that's so unexpected.

391
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:07,720
- No one knows.

392
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,637
Here we go.

393
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,238
- What are you doing?

394
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:13,102
- I gotta eat my pumpkin.

395
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:14,143
It's real food versus jelly food man.

396
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:15,354
- Well couldn't you just take a bite

397
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,294
like an apple?

398
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,469
- Dude, like I can hear it like slushing

399
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:18,559
around in there.

400
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,032
I can't even get my fork out of this thing.

401
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:20,865
- The smell dude.

402
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:21,778
Can't you make it go faster?

403
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:22,890
- It smells like a pumpkin.

404
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,313
Alright, our Aunt Patricia she said, "punkin" instead

405
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:26,211
of pumpkin. - Oh yeah it's cute.

406
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:27,855
- It it's rather adorable but yeah.

407
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:30,088
This is my punkin.

408
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:31,468
- No I can't stand the smell of that.

409
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:32,301
- I think I think I have a way

410
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:33,268
of opening this up.

411
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:34,293
Come with me outside.

412
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:35,126
- Wait outside?

413
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:36,084
Ugh, bro, ugh.

414
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:37,184
- Alright so I guess we gotta open

415
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:38,241
this up somehow.

416
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:39,074
So, right there, watch out.

417
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:40,141
- How? Wait, what? Where?

418
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:40,974
- Right there. - There?

419
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:41,807
- Yep, Right there. - Oh!

420
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:42,840
I know what you're about to do.

421
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,733
- Ready. Three, two, one.

422
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:45,566
(Thud)

423
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:46,508
- [Both] Ooooh!

424
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:47,341
Dude! - The seeds.

425
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:48,937
- There's like pumpkin seeds everywhere.

426
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:49,950
- They're punkin seeds.

427
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,783
- Look at that.

428
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:52,094
Man that's perfect. Alright cool.

429
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:54,420
Bro this smells so gross.

430
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,909
- I'm going back to this technique.

431
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,799
I've never really liked raw pumpkin.

432
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,805
- I got the like the face came off on my hand.

433
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:00,652
Pumpkin is slippery.

434
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:02,376
- That looks really gross bro.

435
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:03,484
- Alright here we go.

436
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:04,817
Three, two, one.

437
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,603
- Ew! How is it?

438
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,331
Is it good? - No!

439
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:11,456
I don't like it.

440
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:12,445
- Just eat one of these.

441
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,491
- No, no , no put that back.

442
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:14,449
Put in on there, put it on there,

443
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:15,398
yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

444
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:16,231
- Alright, alright.

445
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:18,285
- No, n n n n n n n n no.

446
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,171
(Screams)

447
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:20,129
- There we go.

448
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:23,322
- Alright on to the next one. Yo I know exactly what that is

449
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,130
and last time things didn't go so well.

450
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,047
- [Both] Aah, aah, aah!

451
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:29,729
So I'm not giving you any chance

452
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:30,637
of keep it or switch it we're just keepin it.

453
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:32,553
- I knew it. - Three, two, one, go!

454
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:33,386
- [Both] No!

455
00:10:33,386 --> 00:10:34,435
- Dude I was half expecting it

456
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:35,532
to like jump off the table and go ooh.

457
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:36,365
- Ugh!

458
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:38,213
- I have never seen a gummy snake like this man.

459
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:40,767
- That looks so awesome.

460
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,496
- See just when you think you've seen it all

461
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:43,329
when it comes to gummy foods, man,

462
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:44,316
something surprises you

463
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:45,408
cause this one looks super cool.

464
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:46,705
- And we've seen a couple of snakes before

465
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:48,661
and this is the best looking one.

466
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:49,693
There's no way I can really eat this, can I?

467
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,725
- You can try it.

468
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:52,993
Well that went great.

469
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:55,335
- Ugh! It's like painted I think. Ugh.

470
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:56,276
How is it?

471
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:58,490
I was expecting it to be like fssh

472
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,131
but it was just like boop. - Mmm

473
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:01,119
- Wait, I wanna try one more time.

474
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,785
- The texture is crazy.

475
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:03,943
- Wait, I'm going for the tail.

476
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:04,776
- Mmmmm.

477
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:08,221
- Whoa!

478
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:09,896
That's so cool.

479
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:12,090
You can feel the scales too.

480
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,347
- Oh my gosh it's so good.

481
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:14,180
Oh my gosh.

482
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,573
- So awesome.

483
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:17,426
- Put on the whole thing, the whole thing.

484
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,259
- Everything.

485
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,243
Better than whatever this was.

486
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,076
- Yee!

487
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:20,909
(Thud)

488
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:22,471
We are on the second to last round right now

489
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:23,304
- The second to last.

490
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:24,137
- And Devon choose,

491
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:24,970
do you wanna keep em or switch em?

492
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,231
- I have no clue--

493
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:27,548
- Psych! It's my option.

494
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:28,447
I wanna switch em.

495
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:29,886
- When did it become your option?

496
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:30,911
- When I said it was.

497
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:32,244
Three, two, one.

498
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,008
- Yeah!

499
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:37,197
- Oh no. - Those look sour.

500
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,688
- These are for sure gonna be sour.

501
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:39,704
(laughs)

502
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:40,537
You wanna try yours first - I do.

503
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:41,991
- and then we'll go for mine second?

504
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:43,210
They like fused together.

505
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,775
- Whoa, look at it huh.

506
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,225
Alright there's one.

507
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,132
Alright, alright.

508
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:49,751
Mmm. That's good.

509
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,643
Mmm. Taste like lemon, some citrus.

510
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:52,705
- Really, some citrus?

511
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:53,978
- Blueberries.

512
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:55,793
- Mm you're getting all the flavors there man.

513
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:56,626
- Orange.

514
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:57,459
(muttering)

515
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,202
- Whelp, it smells sour.

516
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:00,535
- It looks sour.

517
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:01,625
- Feels sour.

518
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,792
- Wait, feels?

519
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:05,362
Is it?

520
00:12:05,362 --> 00:12:07,542
- Yup. - Yeah, yeah, I knew it.

521
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,177
Wait no, no! Get that off of there.

522
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:12,367
No, no these aren't the gummy ones.

523
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,891
- This is the final round, right now

524
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:16,191
and then we're going to be eating

525
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:18,279
the gummiest sandwich in the entire world

526
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,614
and I am really excited to see what this is

527
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,858

Nothing's happening?

- Do you wanna switch?

538
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,561

00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,468
Dude it's a human organ transplant.

544
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:43,301
- What?

545
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:44,979
- These look like little hearts

546
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:46,774
and they're hard candy.

547
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,321
- No way. - So uh.

548
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:49,154
- No way!

549
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:52,859
Oh dude it feels so weird. - What?

550
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:53,809
- Oh my gosh!

551
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,142
Holy I don't even know what to do.

552
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:55,975
How do you--

553
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,203
I've never been in this situation before.

554
00:12:57,203 --> 00:12:59,719
- Oh. - It's a giant gummy heart.

555
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,353
What the heck. Yeet!

556
00:13:01,353 --> 00:13:02,464
This is ridiculous.

557
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:04,513
Dude it's like boom boom, boom boom.

558
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:05,893
I wonder if it's like, this looks

559
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:07,325
like it's way too big to be an actual human heart

560
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:08,676
Otherwise, like, I got a big heart.

561
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:10,726
This is crazy, man.

562
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:12,318
Like the detail on this is insane,

563
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:13,410
It's got all the little pumps

564
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,891
and the whatever they're called, the valves.

565
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:16,196
I thought it was just gonna be like one of these

566
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,287
Like a big version of like a little heart shaped gummy.

567
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:19,120
- I know.

568
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,229
- This is like a legit organ.

569
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:21,374
- Bro, this is crazy.

570
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:22,902
- Don't touch my heart. - Why not?

571
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:23,735
- Because it's mine, you can't have my heart.

572
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:24,582
- What, what, I wanna touch it.

573
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:26,247
- Should we break my heart? - Wait, why?

574
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:27,080
- Cause I wanna break my heart.

575
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,321
- What? - Because I can do it.

576
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,943
- You're puncturing your heart.

577
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,234
- My thumb is powerful, man.

578
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:33,067
Look at this.

579
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,440
It's doing what no knife could.

580
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,470
I'm gonna break my heart.

581
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,212
It's so hard to break my heart, man

582
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:40,385
my heart's so full.

583
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:42,673
- Dude, that's scaring me.

584
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:43,737
- I got a hole in my heart now.

585
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:44,984
It's about as broken as I'm gonna get.

586
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:47,153
Alright time to take a bite of it man.

587
00:13:47,153 --> 00:13:49,070
- That's a tough heart.

588
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,439
Your lips look so funny.

589
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:55,406
- Bro, this oh my gosh.

590
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:57,687
The best tasting gummy I've ever had.

591
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:58,888
- Well I can't wait to taste it,

592
00:13:58,888 --> 00:13:59,735
in the sandwich.

593
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:01,526
- Well it's now the moment you've all

594
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:02,359
been waiting for.

595
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:05,208
Time to eat the biggest gummy sandwich

596
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,201
in the entire world.

597
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:08,532
And comment down below.

598
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:10,657
What are some other gummy food versus real food

599
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:11,765
that you'd love to see us eat

600
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:12,830
in an upcoming video.

601
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,663
Here we go.

602
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:14,827
So how we're gonna have to do this, man.

603
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:16,185
We'll put the heart on one side,

604
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:17,359
the snake on the other.

605
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,192
- Wait, no no.

606
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,119
We should just take out a piece of the snake.

607
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,009
- No way, bro.

608
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:20,908
We want the whole thing.

609
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:22,170
It's the largest gummy sandwich

610
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,216
in the world, dude.

611
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:24,145
- Okay fine.

612
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:25,453
- So help me out, dude. Hold the plate down.

613
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:26,438
- I'm holding it.

614
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:27,646
- Gotta try to get this up.

615
00:14:27,646 --> 00:14:28,479
- I'm holding it.

616
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,779
- It got teeth on this thing, man.

617
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:30,612
Like, this is nuts.

618
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:31,445
- Whoa, alright.

619
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,383
- So there, there's one half of this sandwich.

620
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:34,216
This thing is crazy.

621
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:35,512
Its got teeth on it and everything.

622
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:37,189
- Wait, look at the top. Show them the top.

623
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,456
- Yo, the top's like a brain.

624
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:39,721
- That's crazy dude.

625
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:40,603
- Oh my gosh.

626
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:41,650
- Teeth are fallin off.

627
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,483
- Holy cow! - Look at that.

628
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:44,973
It looks like it bit that snake too.

629
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:47,873
- Dude this thing is so whooping heavy.

630
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:48,980

00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:53,184
Wait, wait, I didn't.

635
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,508
I can't do it while you're biting.

636
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:57,091
Alright, I get the bottom half.

637
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,899
- Yo that's crazy.

638
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:04,293
I gotta get all of it.

00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,459
- Whoa that's so good.

640
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:08,714

641
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:09,925
- You got one of these?

642
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,945
