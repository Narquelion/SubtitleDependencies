1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,681
- [Devan] You challenged us to make slime out of shampoo

2
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:05,110
so you can get luscious locks, just like mine.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,680
Oh no, where's the shampoo?

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,802
- [Collins] Oh no!

5
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:10,135
(screaming)

6
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:12,674
- All right, enough with that, now it's time

7
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:15,242
to open up the box and get our ingredients.

8
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:16,075
- [Both] Whoa!

9
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:16,908
- They're like balloons!

10
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:18,341
We got baking soda, contact solution.

11
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:19,174
- Glue!

12
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:20,199
- We got some shampoo.

13
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,887
And also got some glue!

14
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:23,612
Bam, all right! We got the shower ring things.

15
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:24,611
We're gonna use these to open up the balloons.

16
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:25,878
So I'm gonna go with glue first.

17
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,154
- Oh okay, okay, did it work?

18
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:27,987
Oh! - Oh!

19
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:29,199
(coughing)

20
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,032
- Baking soda. (air horn blasts)

21
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:30,865
- Oh!

22
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,240
And using balloons to get like slime ingredients

23
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,804
is currently trending on YouTube.

24
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:34,637
That's a weird noise.

25
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:36,279
- Bro! I got Sharpie all over my hands!

26
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,066
- Oh man, I'm nervous about this one.

27
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,157
It's up in the air again.

28
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:40,172
- Mixing time!

29
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:41,020
- Is that the mixer?

30
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,186
- Yeah, dude, this is totally working!

31
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:44,418
- Three, two, one. (splashing)

32
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:45,849
(screaming) (sad piano music)

33
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:46,682
- Dude!

34
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:48,815
- It went in my eye! Oh snap, this is awesome!

35
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,648
You may be questioning my fashion,

36
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:51,518
but this is what they're really for.

37
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,328
In the loofahs while I loofa-cate it.

38
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:55,273
- Dude, I found a hair in mine.

39
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:57,069
- Oh, it's from the wig!

40
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:58,015
- You get to comment down below

41
00:00:58,015 --> 00:00:59,406
who made cooler shampoo slime,

42
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:00,868
and the real winner should be the one

43
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:02,107
who has the most loofahs on their wrists.

44
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:03,064
That's me.

45
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,373
- Last time, you challenged us

46
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:05,539
to make a slime out of a toothpaste.

47
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:06,372
- Yes!

48
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:07,346
- So we got the toothbrush-- - The what?

49
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:08,491
- Gotta brush my teeth now.

50
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:10,401
No time for plaque!

51
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:12,504
- All right, now it's time to add the toothpaste

52
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:13,337
to the water.

53
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:14,411
(screams)

54
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,160
All right, time to empty the water bottle

55
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,763
that we have to drink out of first.

56
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:20,013
(mumbling)

57
00:01:21,654 --> 00:01:22,487
(coughing)

58
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:23,403
- This is going great.

59
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:24,919
(mumbling)

60
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,044
(screaming)

61
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,574
(mumbling)

62
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:28,849
(gurgling)

63
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,144
- It went down my shirt.

64
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:31,218
(swallows) - Got it.

65
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:32,789
I'm gonna empty out the rest right now.

66
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,732
Got a light saber.

67
00:01:34,732 --> 00:01:36,323
- Dude, what are you doing? (mumbling)

68
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:38,996
No, we're making slime, we're not brushing our teeth.

69
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:39,829
(mumbling)

70
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:40,662
- Oh!

71
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:41,495
- Oh, now it's time to shake it up.

72
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:43,582
- All right, so we're going to pop this out, here we go.

73
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:44,731
Oh! - Oh!

74
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:45,981
- The baking powder!

75
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,867
Okay, (blabbers) the top is not on!

76
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,590
So we're going to say about, like, that much.

77
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,529
That's it, that's it, right there.

78
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:51,362
Bam.

79
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,009
- Did I add too much? - You added way too much, bro.

80
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,801
So now it's time for the shake-a-rake. You ready for this?

81
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:55,634
(shaking)

82
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:56,467
Oh snap!

83
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,960
- Now it's time to add some of this stuff which is...

84
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,916
Face wash.

85
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,240
Or face mask.

86
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,128
- It's party time.

87
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:02,983
- Ooh, the sound.

88
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:04,845
- And then you add some of this baking soda.

89
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:05,882
- Better not use this as toothpaste

90
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:07,436
or it's gonna add the face wash in.

91
00:02:07,436 --> 00:02:08,310
(squelches) - Ugh!

92
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,026
- Next step, you stir it with your toothbrush.

93
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:11,002
- Peep these out, bro.

94
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:14,088
They're like little sticky jumps. Boop. - Oh, yeah.

95
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:15,479
- Oh, these are awesome.

96
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,020
- No, no, no.

97
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,953
- Trickshot time, here we go.

98
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:18,786
(pop) (buzzer)

99
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:19,619
Well that didn't work.

100
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:20,772
All right, let me try it one more time.

101
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:21,910
- Oh, hey.

102
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,383
- Woo, trick shot!

103
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:25,142
- Once you have this mixed over here

104
00:02:25,142 --> 00:02:26,521
and you have this all shaken up,

105
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,260
now you combine them together.

106
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,093
(sneeze)

107
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:29,926
Dude. - Sorry.

108
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:30,759
- Now you mix it together.

109
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,592
(angelic music)

110
00:02:31,592 --> 00:02:32,445
It smells so good.

111
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:33,278
I think it needs more.

112
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,604
- I don't know if you know what you're doing, bro.

113
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:35,437
- I don't.

114
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:36,735
- Next step, you get a little bit of contact solution

115
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:37,651
you gotta add in here. - Wait, what?

116
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,484
- Bloop, that's it.

117
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:39,858
Whoa! Have a little slime dance like

118
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:40,691
(yells)

119
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:42,232
All right, here we go, the moment of truth.

120
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:43,982
Is it going to work with the toothpaste?

121
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:44,815
Oh. - Oh.

122
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:46,336
[Devan] So, that's how it's suppose to be.

123
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:47,394
(yells)

124
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:48,227
Dude.

125
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:49,708
- Wow, that is, like, so pungent with the mint.

126
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,324
- Oh, man. Like it really just makes your nose just go

127
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:52,157
(voicing silly sounds)

128
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:52,990
- I love mint.

129
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,040
- You know, I think my slime was a little bit better

130
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,422
before I added the toothpaste, to be honest.

131
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,324
Dude, yours is literally the craziest slime

132
00:02:57,324 --> 00:02:59,210
you have ever made, so here's the big reveal.

133
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,185
Three, two... - Three, two...

134
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:01,018
- Wait, first.

135
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:01,934
We've got merch! - We've got merch!

136
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:03,695

137
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,358

138
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:06,191

(both yell)

144
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,915
- No, mine totally failed, bro.

145
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:18,374
Dude, yours is so cool, what? - What?

146
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:20,564
It's, like, literally toothpaste slime.

147
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:23,647
So, this stuff looks absolutely crazy.

148
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,243
- It's almost like it has glitter in it.

149
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:26,076
- What?

150
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:27,048
You can get to comment down below,

151
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:28,232
who made cooler slime for this round,

152
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:29,386
and at the end of this video

153
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:31,194
we're gonna be making a grand slam slime

154
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:32,584
with ingredients from this whole video.

155
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:34,596
We'll be saving the toothpaste to add to our final slime

156
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:36,528
and right now, we are on to the next round.

157
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:37,652
Time to get clean. (squirt)

158
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:38,485
Oh! - Oh!

159
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,112
- Snap! See, we gotta keep things clean,

160
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:42,600
so we're gonna show you how to make soap slime, bro.

161
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,152
This is how you clean properly, bro.

162
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:45,824
Just go like this, and get it into the bowl.

163
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,055
- Oh my gosh, the concentration.

164
00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:49,183
It's like the lake at a putt-putt golfing place.

165
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:50,016
- Oh, snap.

166
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:51,783
For something so clean, man, it sure made a mess.

167
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:53,443
But I'm gonna scoop it up here, wash my hands

168
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,165
as it goes in because ya always gotta make sure

169
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:56,442
to wash your hands thoroughly.

170
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:58,108
- I made a bubble! I made a bubble! There's a b...

171
00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:58,941
- I got it!

172
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:00,302
- Bam! Now I'm gonna transferred to this finger.

173
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:01,135
What?

174
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:02,548
I am like a bubble factory, bro.

175
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:03,550
- This is my chance!

176
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,564
Oh my gosh!

177
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:06,484
- All right, in order to separate the yolk

178
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:07,317
from the egg white,

179
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:08,719
I have to use this water bottle.

180
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,505
But first, I have to get the water out.

181
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:12,288
- [Collins] Hopefully I don't get soap on the bottle.

182
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:13,425
Devan's almost done, but I can beat him.

183
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:14,545
(tape whirring)

184
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,486
(coughing)

185
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:16,356
- And done!

186
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,774
You can not beat me.

187
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:18,883
Three, two, one.

188
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:19,716
(squirt)

189
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:20,865
Oh! What?!

190
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:22,215
I did not expect that to work.

191
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:23,116
Oh, oh no.

192
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:23,949
Oh, I got it.

193
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:24,782
Oh no!

194
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:26,006
When it's a broken yolk, it doesn't work.

195
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:26,839
- [Collins] Here we go.

196
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,339
And I emptied out, two more eggs,

197
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,458
I'm gonna do these at the same time.

198
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,728
Head-to-head competition. (crack)

199
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,971
So who won? - This guy.

200
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:32,888
I'm just gonna go for a different method.

201
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:33,721
Just hand-grab.

202
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:34,779
It's a lot easier, just like this.

203
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:35,806
This gets the yolk out.

204
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:36,997
All right, just gonna transfer this--

205
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:38,016
- And intercepted!

206
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,458
- Oh! He stole my yolk!

207
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,457
- [Devan] Is yours already mixing?

208
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:41,290
- Yeah, dude, I'm mixing my stuff.

209
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,737
- I haven't even added my soap yet.

210
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:44,791
This looks like some weird snot, dude.

211
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,624
(sneezes)

212
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:46,457
- Oh oh! Wait a minute.

213
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:47,520
Wait a minute, bro.

214
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,542
It increased its slimy-ness by like 5% just now.

215
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:51,793
Dude, you're mixing like a chef.

216
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:53,468
Like a professional Michelin Star chef.

217
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:54,490
- Thank you for the compliment

218
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,392
- Got little boats, man.

219
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:56,490
Little eggshell yachts.

220
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,839
Uh-oh. We're encountering a storm.

221
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,822
(thunder)

222
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:00,530
- [Devan] Dude dude dude dude dude!

223
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,847
Yo, my drips so good.

224
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,808
- But, I mean, can yours do this, bro?

225
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:04,955
- Uh, no, what?

226
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:05,788
- Woohoo!

227
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,267
There's a bubble, yes, I have a bubble.

228
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:08,739
I've never seen that before!

229
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:09,572
Wow!

230
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:10,405
- Oh, don't leave us!

231
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:11,238
- Oh, it popped.

232
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:13,438
Yo, dude, that is so cool. - Oh, dude.

233
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,049
- The only issue, though, is that this is not a real bubble,

234
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:15,998
because it's also got egg in it.

235
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:17,258
So you don't want to get this bubble everywhere.

236
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:19,345
So you get to comment down below, who made cooler slime?

237
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:20,709
Is it my bubble slime?

238
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,107
- [Devan] Or is it my Ghostbusters slime?

239
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:23,614
- So, yeah, comment down below right now.

240
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,776
We will be adding dish soap into our final grand slam slime.

241
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:28,533
And right now, we are on to the next round.

242
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,878
In this round, you challenged us to make

243
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:31,809
one ingredient slime, and all you need is gum.

244
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,025
Dude, how did you blow such a big bubble?

245
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:33,858
(deflating)

246
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:34,864
It's a balloon.

247
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:35,764
So we're gonna get this out there.

248
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:36,745
(grunting)

249
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,205
That's what you call "shelling the gum".

250
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,326
Check this out.

251
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,545
Yo, check it out, bro, it's all shelled!

252
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:42,736
Just like that.

253
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,149
Three, two, one...

254
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,049
(exclaims)

255
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,829
Yo, I had no clue this is what gum looks like

256
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:47,676
on the inside, bro, it's like...

257
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:48,610
(voicing silly noises)

258
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,340
All right, guys, we're gonna shell all of these.

259
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,489
Or just unwrap them.

260
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:52,761
We'll be back in like five seconds.

261
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:53,701
Here we go. Boop!

262
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:54,534
We shelled all the gum.

263
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:55,367
So, I've got Bubble Yum.

264
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:56,200
- I have Orbit.

265
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,033
Oh! - Oh my gosh!

266
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,069
The only thing left you gotta do is

267
00:05:58,069 --> 00:05:59,541
just to add some hot water into it.

268
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,551
So, I have the Bubble Yum

269
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,159
and we're trying to see which one is,

270
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:02,992
what?! - Ow, I got it on me!

271
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:05,202
- Be careful when pouring hot water.

272
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:06,392
- I poured too fast.

273
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:07,481
- So, now I'm just gonna kinda, like,

274
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:08,990
let them soak in here for a little bit.

275
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,899
Let's rub some balloons.

276
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:10,732
(squeaking)

277
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:11,565
- I'd rather pop them.

278
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:12,531
Three, two, one.

279
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:13,364
(pop)

280
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:14,197
(yelling)

281
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:15,030
(buzzer)

282
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,863
(blow)

283
00:06:15,863 --> 00:06:17,138
(yelling)

284
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:19,352
Dude, it hit me in the side of the face.

285
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:20,264
- Let's see how our gum is doing.

286
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:21,701
All right, our gum has been sitting here

287
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:22,540
for about five minutes.

288
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,493
Time to dump the water out.

289
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:24,783
(yelling)

290
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:26,452
- This water looks really tasty, though.

291
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,813
- I don't think you should drink gum water.

292
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:28,646
Probably not the best thing to do.

293
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:29,674
So now it's all melted down and,

294
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:30,962
time to see if we can turn it into slime.

295
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:31,795
Yo, dude!

296
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:34,094
It like totally melted the the gum down.

297
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:34,960
- Look at mine!

298
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,793
- Whoa!

299
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:37,151
That's why we tried two different gums, 'cause we're

300
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:37,984
gonna get two different results.

301
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:38,817
- [Devan] Oh!

302
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:39,650
- [Collins] Oh, it's like juicing now, man.

303
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,991
This water's just kablooshin' everywhere.

304
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:42,700
- Dude, it's, like, legit turning into slime!

305
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,928
This is so cool!

306
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:46,099
One-ingredient slime with gum, bro.

307
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:47,190
This is the future!

308
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,486
- [Devan] Why is mine so gross?

309
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:49,319
- What?!

310
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,789
This is by far the coolest slime ever because it's also gum,

311
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,400
so you could technically chew it at any point.

312
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,233
- [Devan] Avert your eyes.

313
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,066
- [Collins] Why? Oh.

314
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,398
So, there is actually one flaw with mine;

315
00:06:57,398 --> 00:06:58,339
It's very sticky.

316
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:59,700
- But that's not a flaw.

317
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,160
This is a flaw.

318
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,138
- Dude, I think I'm like one of the

319
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,092
professional taffy-makers, you know, they're like...

320
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:05,717
(voicing silly noises)

321
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,602
It looks like a burger more than it looks like slime.

322
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:09,350
Maybe you made the first-ever slime burger.

323
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,041
But dude, you gotta eat it, but first you gotta give it a

324
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,366
woohoo!

325
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,697
This is what I call "the stick test".

326
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:14,530
Three, two, one.

327
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,980
(slap)

328
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,813
- Whoa!

329
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:18,107
- Yeah, this definitely doesn't pass the stick test.

330
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:18,957
My slime.

331
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:21,616
Bubble Yum worked super duper duper well for this.

332
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,047
- And this worked terrible.

333
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:24,236
- Three, two, one.

334
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,108
(chomp)

335
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:25,941
(stretch)

336
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:27,672
- [Devan] That seems so amazing.

337
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:28,512
Can you blow a bubble?

338
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:29,345
(blowing)

339
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,393
- All I gotta say...

340
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:31,226
(mumbling)

341
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:32,059
This gum!

342
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:32,892
- Oh, this gum is...

343
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:33,725
- Really good.

344
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:34,791
It looks like a pizza.

345
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:35,785
All right, go for it, man.

346
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:36,956
- Three, two, one--

347
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,813
- Wait, wait, first!

348
00:07:37,813 --> 00:07:38,646
Five second subscribe challenge.

349
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:39,896
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel and

350
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:43,052
turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

351
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:44,076
Are you ready? Here we go.

352
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:48,625
Five, Four, Three, Two, One. - Five, Four, Three, Two, One.

353
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,458
Done. - Done.

354
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,522
You can comment down below, Keyper squad right now.

355
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:52,768
And Devan, time to eat it.

356
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:53,601
Let's see how this thing tastes.

357
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:54,434
(chomp)

358
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:55,665
wooh! - Oh!

359
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:57,229
It tastes so good.

360
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:00,739
All the bubblegum-ness left, and all the mint stayed.

361
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:02,578
- You can comment down below, whose gum slime turned out

362
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:04,737
better and now it's on to the next round.

363
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:05,570
Soda hat!

364
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,572
Eh! - Wait, what?

365
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:07,405
What is going on?

366
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:09,625
This morning, you challenged us to make soda slime,

367
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,157
so right now, let's go.

368
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,312
Now it's time to add the soda.

369
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:13,501
- Why is mine so small?

370
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,913
- 'Cause you're the younger brother and so you get

371
00:08:14,913 --> 00:08:16,360
the smaller soda, you know how it goes.

372
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,517
All right, just gonna add a little bit in.

373
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:18,655
And I've got Coke, you've got Pepsi,

374
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,319
so you know what that means, right?

375
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,152
(yell)

376
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:21,985
(grunt)

377
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:24,176
(lightsabers clashing)

378
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:25,366
(yelling)

379
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,276
(deep voice) Devan, I am your older brother.

380
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:28,188
- No!

381
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,497
- Well, that was fun, and now.

382
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:30,330
(screams)

383
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,461
Time to mix it up and hopefully create some bubbles.

384
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,901
- Uh, Collins, when you said "create bubbles", did you mean

385
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:36,518
actually create bubbles?

386
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:38,140
Look around for a second.

387
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,523
- Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

388
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:40,356
(blowing)

389
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:41,994
Now it's time for some contact solution.

390
00:08:41,994 --> 00:08:43,652
The reason you use contact solution is because

391
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:45,274
it'll actually create a clear slime,

392
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,584
which is kind of what we're going for in this one

393
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:48,383
where the Sta-flo makes it kinda milky.

394
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,681
Around the circumference of the bowl.

395
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:50,653
- Ah, it just hit my face.

396
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:52,775
- And I am very excited because I've got a new way.

397
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:53,763
I'm mixing up this slime.

398
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:55,946
It's little tongs with these little holes in them.

399
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:57,858
See, you put it in here and now you, like, scoop it up.

400
00:08:57,858 --> 00:08:59,539
You'll be like, whoa, okay, how's my slime doin'?

401
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,372
I must admit,

402
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,027
this contraption worked a lot better in my head.

403
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:03,156
So, I think I'm gonna just go in with the hands.

404
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,918
Whoa, this slime did not turn out well at all.

405
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:08,118
You get to comment down below, who made cooler soda slime.

406
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:09,378
It just, like, it just breaks apart.

407
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:10,879
- At least yours is actually slime.

408
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,311
- [Collins] Yeah. - [Devan] Mine is just glue.

409
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:13,333
Oh! - Oh snap!

410
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,945
Well you challenged us to make kinetic sand slime.

411
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:16,963
First step, we gotta add the glue.

412
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:18,264
So I'm just gonna pick this up right over here.

413
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:19,897
(clicking)

414
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:21,131
- Whoa, whoa!

415
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:22,412
Did I break it? - Yeah, you broke it.

416
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:24,012
Oh, I hope it doesn't break!

417
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:24,845
(screeching)

418
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:25,991
(yelling)

419
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:27,121
All right, there, easy.

420
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:28,513
- His name is Asbestos.

421
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:29,346
- Uh, what?

422
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:30,729
(yelping)

423
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:31,562
Dude, it's a fork.

424
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:32,395
There you go, now tip it.

425
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:33,228
Yeah.

426
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:34,294
It's stuck, it's stuck.

427
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:35,745
- So now, next step, we gotta add the Sta-flo,

428
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:37,282
but first, Devan, you gotta put on your decorative hat.

429
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:38,115
- I feel like a bird.

430
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:39,432
You know, like...

431
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:40,265
- Next step, gotta add the Sta-flo,

432
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:41,974
so just gonna pump it in there.

433
00:09:41,974 --> 00:09:42,836
There we go. (Devan growling)

434
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:43,741
- Dude, what are you doing?

435
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:44,681
Are you scuba diving?

436
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:45,918
It's not recommended.

437
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,009
(gurgling)

438
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:47,883
It sounds like a car.

439
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:49,780
- All right, well, for this next part, guys, I'm goin' in.

440
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,613
And you know what that means.

441
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:51,446
- No.

442
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:52,402
- Too small for my head, wow.

443
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:53,235
(grunting)

444
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:54,660
Ugh! - Really?

445
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,703
Luckily we got some smaller goggles.

446
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:56,536
So here's what we can do. - Nice.

447
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:58,369
- Put these on right like this, and you need

448
00:09:58,369 --> 00:09:59,430
smaller goggles, nemma nemma nem.

449
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,155
Only with my, ow, let go, let go.

450
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,083
- I can't, I can't, you trapped my arm.

451
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:02,916
- No!

452
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,974
- You know you could just use the goggles, right?

453
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:05,807
- Ow.

454
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:06,640
(yelling)

455
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,956
I got two goggles!

456
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:08,925
(tape whirring)

457
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:09,806
There's my thingy!

458
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:10,697
I'm goin' in.

459
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:11,745
You gotta mix up the slime.

460
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,470
(mumbling)

461
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,471
- [Devan] Time to add our sand.

462
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:15,762
- Ooh! - In the slime.

463
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:16,803
This stuff smells weird.

464
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:18,751
Oh, this is not like sand at all.

465
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,312
- Use your claws to make it slimy.

466
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:22,124
- Yeah, you didn't do a good job with that slime,

467
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:22,957
no offense.

468
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:23,790
- Uh, offense taken, bro.

469
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,690
Uh, what?

470
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,411
All right, gotta pop it in my bucket of joy.

471
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:27,244
And then just...

472
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:28,077
(squish)

473
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:29,327
- Ugh!

474
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:30,499
(laughing)

475
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:32,418
- All right, this stuff here is called Connecticut sand.

476
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:33,379
It comes from Connecticut.

477
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:34,409
- No, it's kinetic.

478
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:35,242
- Kansas. - Connecticut.

479
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:36,316
- Kansas! Comes from Kansas.

480
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:37,758
So now I'm just mixing up my slime.

481
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:38,928
- [Devan] Whoa!

482
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:40,635
- Yo, it's already kinda, like, sandy.

483
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:42,173
You get to comment down below right now,

484
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,698
who made crazier sand slime.

485
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:45,969
And this stuff feels so wild,

486
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:47,740
you can feel all the grains of sand in it.

487
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,737
But it's really satisfying at the same time and right now

488
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:50,840
we are on to the next round.

489
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,408
(yelling) (leaf blower blowing)

490
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:57,719
Well, you challenged us to do toilet paper slime

491
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,219
so right now let's go.

492
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,470
- All right, so the first step is to

493
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,419
tear up some toilet paper.

494
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:02,252
- I got you, bro!

495
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:03,974
(leaf blower blowing)

496
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:06,124
(yelling)

497
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,509
- I got it, I got some!

498
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:08,342
- You might need to share,

499
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:09,175
I might need a little bit. - No!

500
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:11,236
- Let's tear up the toilet paper now, so we gotta get these

501
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,557
into as small pieces as we possibly can.

502
00:11:12,557 --> 00:11:14,675
Next up, we gotta add a little bit of Fiji water to what's

503
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,077
going on, so we gotta open this up.

504
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:16,949
Just a little bit, Devan.

505
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:18,018
- Wait, why Fiji water?

506
00:11:18,018 --> 00:11:20,088
- Because it's from Fiji, it's a little island.

507
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,028
- You make no sense.

508
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:21,890
- I know, not.

509
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,979
- What are you a robot now?

510
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:25,248
(robotic voice) I do not make sense anymore.

511
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:26,081
- Toilet paper.

512
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:27,281
All right, so now I guess we just mix it up a little bit

513
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:28,114
with the water.

514
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:29,808
- [Devan] There is no mixing up, it just turns into a ball.

515
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:31,107
- It's snowing!

516
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,396
So next up, you're gonna add some stuff.

517
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:33,229
(singing)

518
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:34,673
Yeah!

519
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:35,982
- Got my hype-man over here.

520
00:11:35,982 --> 00:11:37,373
- [Collins] Gonna add some glue into what's goin' on.

521
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:38,682
Gonna take this toilet paper off of here and you're

522
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:39,903
not gonna need it again.

523
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,132
You need a little dispensary over here,

524
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:42,792
so just use it to just dump the glue in.

525
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,644
- It actually seems harder, Collins.

526
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:45,477
- Oh!

527
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:46,493
No! - Dude, no!

528
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:48,429
- Nothing happened, all is good.

529
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:51,111
My toilet paper is not, like, at all doing anything in here.

530
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,071
- Same with mine, actually.

531
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:52,904
- Ugh, can you not?

532
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:54,497
It looks like a giant, melted marshmallow right now.

533
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:56,893
It's like, I kinda wanna... I shouldn't eat it...

534
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:58,217
Dude, my slime's, like, clogged up.

535
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,050
I gotta fix this.

536
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,883
Here we go.

537
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:00,716
- [Devan] Wait, what, dude...

538
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:02,176
- Oh no!

539
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:03,856
- [Devan] It's like it got cemented in there.

540
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,726
(yelling) - What happened?

541
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,859
- (booming voice) What? - (laughs)

542
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,184
- You yelled right in my ear.

543
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:09,336
- I wonder if I can, like, do it to the table.

544
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:10,375
Oh, snap!

545
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,763
Oh, woo-hoo!

546
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,484
- Next step for me is to add some clay.

547
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,317
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. (record screeches)

548
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,175
Excuse me, it's not just clay, it's Soft Clay

549
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:17,008
(soft piano music)

550
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:17,841
by these guys.

551
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:19,916
Whoa, my slime is kind of chunky, funky,

552
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,727
not at all optimal, but it's time to add the clay in now,

553
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:23,716
because while Devan's doing it,

554
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:24,877
I don't wanna be left behind.

555
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,789
Gonna place it here,

556
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:27,396
and now it's time to get it in!

557
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,877
This plunger, man, it definitely does not do the job.

558
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,017
Come on, get out of the bowl.

559
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,717
Woo, this has gotta be one of the messiest videos

560
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:33,550
we've ever done, bro.

561
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,383
(yelling)

562
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:35,597
Well, I now added the toilet paper in mine.

563
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:36,909
Hopefully that makes a better slime.

564
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:38,418
- [Devan] Okay, okay, okay.

565
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:39,921
- [Collins] All right, all right, gonna mix it in now.

566
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:41,718
- Dude, yours looks insane.

567
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:42,769
- (demonic voice) The workout is real.

568
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,998
In through the nose, out through the mouth.

569
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:45,889
- Yo, leave us a comment down below,

570
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,757
who made cooler toilet paper slime.

571
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:49,299
And we'll be using toilet paper in our final

572
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,169
grand slam slime at the end of the video,

573
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:52,877
so right now it's on to the next round,

574
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:53,710
dude, you better chill.

575
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,567
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

576
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:55,997
- Whoa, no, dude! - All good.

577
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:56,830
- Banana time!

578
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,428
Hey, yo, it actually worked!

579
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:00,144
So, we're gonna show you how to make some lotion slime,

580
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:01,820
so right now, let's go, banana time.

581
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,653
(glass shattering)

582
00:13:02,653 --> 00:13:05,264
Gotta pop a banana out, put it into my thing of glue.

583
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:06,097
There we go.

584
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:07,519
Yeah, this is the unprecedented,

585
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,477
you ain't never seen this before.

586
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:09,310
It's the first time ever.

587
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,037
(laughing)

588
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:11,870
- Ugh!

589
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,196
Next up, we add food coloring.

590
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:14,598
Wait, dude, no, not lotion.

591
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:16,036
- Is that too much lotion to use do you think?

592
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:16,869
- Definitely.

593
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:18,267
- All right, dude, you gotta add a couple dots of the blue.

594
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:19,559
- That's why you don't use hand lotion

595
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,707
before you make the slime.

596
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:22,377
- [Collins] Whoa, that's, like, the coolest color of blue

597
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,509
I've ever made with a slime before.

598
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,309
Gotta take this banana and then just crack it in half.

599
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:27,529
And now you got mushed-up banana in your slime,

600
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:28,665
which is exactly what you want.

601
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:30,208
- It should be called the Break-Up Wake-Up,

602
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,336
'cause you breaked it. - (buzzer)

603
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:32,585
You broked it. - (laughing)

604
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:33,682
- [Collins] All right, well the food coloring's mixed in,

605
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,653
so next up, it's time to add baking soda.

606
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:37,052
(jolting noises sounding)

607
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:38,242
- [Devan] That's a lot, right?

608
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:39,075
- Yeah, well, not really.

609
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:41,164
- Oh wow, wow, wow, wow. - The air tastes weird.

610
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:41,997
- Ugh.

611
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:43,156
All right, we're gonna get the spatula out of here,

612
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,755
it's messing with my jam, so.

613
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,435
- [Devan] Yeah, should've been mixing from the

614
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:47,277
front part of the spatula.

615
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:48,775
- [Collins] Have you ever used a spatula before?

616
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:49,657
- Apparently not.

617
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:51,195
Next up, we add the lotion.

618
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,356
- But first it's time to demonstrate the

619
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:53,872
power of the lotion!

620
00:13:53,872 --> 00:13:55,056
Got a piece of a dried up banana.

621
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:55,889
Yeet!

622
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:56,722
Lotion!

623
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:57,555
(laughing) - Jeez.

624
00:13:57,555 --> 00:13:58,388
- Thank you!

625
00:13:58,388 --> 00:13:59,221
Just rub it right on there and...

626
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:00,066
Tah-dah!

627
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:01,388
You have a full banana!

628
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:02,229
(mumbling)

629
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:03,361
You can eat it.

630
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:05,907
And now you know (booming voice) the power of lotion!

631
00:14:05,907 --> 00:14:06,740
- All right, movin' on.

632
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,949
I'll just add this for you.

633
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:08,890
- [Collins] Yeah, can you please add the lotion for me.

634
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,723
- [Devan] All right, there you go.

635
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,729
- The power of lotion! - Whoa, no no no!

636
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:12,562
(yelling)

637
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:13,395
(sighs)

638
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,963
- [Collins] Right off the bat, the lotion has actually

639
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:16,074
kind of turned this into slime.

640
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:17,852
And also, like, chunks of banana in here, so

641
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:19,174
hopefully that doesn't mess with the whole concoction.

642
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:20,007
(squeaking)

643
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:20,845
Whoa! - Whoa!

644
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:21,678
I got it on pants.

645
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:22,791
- So basically the lotion, ow.

646
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,598
So basically, this lotion acts like the Sta-flo,

647
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,279
so it acts as the activator in it.

648
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,539
Man, this is coming out so slow.

649
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:28,372
(growling)

650
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:29,205
[Collins] Is yours working?

651
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:30,679
- [Devan] Yep, it's workin'.

652
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,814
What? Why is yours so gloopy?

653
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:33,024
- [Collins] Ugh, there we go, oh!

654
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:34,115
That's a ton of baking soda.

655
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:35,576
Dude, I think it worked!

656
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:36,676
- Yeah, but look at mine.

657
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:37,555
- Wooh!

658
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:38,614
Quite the workout, I gotta admit.

659
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:40,911
Like, lotion is usually soft, smooth, and suppulent.

660
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:41,744
Suppulent?

661
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:42,577
Succulent.

662
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:43,738
No, that's not it. - I don't know.

663
00:14:43,738 --> 00:14:45,066
Dude, it actually worked!

664
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,038
You get to comment down below, who won this round and

665
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:48,715
who made better lotion slime

666
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:50,466
and right now we are on to the next one.

667
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:51,503
For this one we are making a--

668
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:52,727
- Payback!

669
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:56,482
Wooh! (leaf blower blowing)

670
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:57,315
(coughs)

671
00:14:57,315 --> 00:14:58,241
That's what I'm talkin' about!

672
00:14:58,241 --> 00:14:59,302
(coughs)

673
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:00,301
- Well, I'm now wearing a toga.

674
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:03,283
For the grand slam slime, we get to use any items that

675
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:05,233
we want for this time to make the coolest one possible.

676
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:06,882
So I'm kicking off with toothpaste right now.

677
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:08,133
And then next I'm gonna go for some sand,

678
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,152
so I'm gonna pop.

679
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:10,043
(pops) Oh!

680
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,241
So we're gonna pop some sand in here, just.

681
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:13,212
- Bro, I should not have started out with gum, it's so slow.

682
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,003
- Get out of there, toilet paper, it aint your time.

683
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:16,623
[Collins] Why did we never use this earlier, bro.

684
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:17,456
Gotta get a little.

685
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:18,289
(making screeching noises)

686
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:19,412
Then they're being like, aw, skert!

687
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:21,870
- [Devan] Now, this soda should dissolve the gum,

688
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,266
just like the water did, so, hoping it has the same effect.

689
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,901
- It was hot water, bro, that's, like, cold soda.

690
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,587
- [Collins] Next up we got some shampoo.

691
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:28,420
- And I've got lotion.

692
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,794
Dude, this does not come out.

693
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:30,627
I'm scooping it out.

694
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:31,477
Nope, that doesn't work either.

695
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:32,560
(squish)

696
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,434
- So, I'm just gonna take off my toilet paper toga right now

697
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,093
and pop it in here like this.

698
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:38,712
This was a lot of toilet paper and not a lot of slime.

699
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:39,871
- [Devan] This looks so gross.

700
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,235
- [Collins] That is not a pleasing color at all, man.

701
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:42,068
- No it's not.

702
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:43,551
- [Collins] Here we go, so that should mush it down.

703
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,414
Break down the toilet paper just kinda bit by bit, you know,

704
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:47,634
and then just adios, amigos.

705
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:48,467
Oh. - Oh.

706
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,407
- You gotta relax, guys.

707
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,406
More glue!

708
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:51,807
- I hope you didn't need lotion,

709
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,500
because I'm kind of using it up.

710
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,541
- My slime's got the sand in it,

711
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,060
so it's got a certain amount of grain to it.

712
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,893
- Oh!

713
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,651
- It's, uh, not the best. - I forgot about the sand.

714
00:15:58,651 --> 00:15:59,510
Well, there we go.

715
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,599
- Well, mine's turning into like a slushie soup

716
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,287
that looks kind of like melted ice cream.

717
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:04,528
(tape whirring)

718
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,340
So here are the final mystery slimes.
