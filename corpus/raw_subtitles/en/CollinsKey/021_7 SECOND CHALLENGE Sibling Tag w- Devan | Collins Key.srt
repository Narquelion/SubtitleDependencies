1
00:00:00,435 --> 00:00:03,352
(fast-paced music)

2
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:08,714
- What's up, It's Collins Key

3
00:00:08,714 --> 00:00:11,038
and I'm here today at The 5th Wave premiere

4
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:12,922
with my little brother Devan Key.

5
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:13,953
- Hey!

6
00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:15,999
- We're live here at The Grove doing a live challenge,

7
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,874
which is something that we've never done before.

8
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:21,504
And this is in honor of the film coming out on January 22nd.

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:24,603
And today we're going to be doing the seven second challenge

10
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:26,448
and the reason we're doing this is because in the film,

11
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:27,835
things are happening so fast.

12
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:29,016
They're having to just react

13
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:30,025
to all these different things happening.

14
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:32,427
So right now we're gonna try to test this in real life.

15
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:35,099
We've got seven seconds to do some crazy stuff,

16
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:37,771
so yeah, without any further ado, let's get into that.

17
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,794
- Jump into the video.

18
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:42,405
So the first one is, tell us an alien joke.

19
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:43,822
Seven, six, five,

20
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:45,877
four, three...

21
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:47,343
- Oh, an alien walks into a bar.

22
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:48,176
Ow.

23
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:49,247
(crickets chirping)

24
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,655
- Yay

25
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:51,488
- Alright, a lot of fun guys,

26
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:52,838
I'm gonna go just cry now.

27
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:53,880
(air horn sounding)

28
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,150
Let's do this,

29
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,409
you guys wanna see us do a little competition right now?

30
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:58,242
- [Audience] Yes.

31
00:00:58,242 --> 00:00:59,387
- And you were asking about muscles, right?

32
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:00,338
You wanna see some muscles?

33
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:01,728
Okay, we're gonna see who can do

34
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,139
more push ups in seven seconds,

35
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:06,260
but you guys have to count them down, okay?

36
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,475
- They have to be real push ups.

37
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:09,744
They can't be like the weak ones, you know?

38
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:11,424
They have to be real push ups.

39
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,213
- You're putting me on blast already, alright.

40
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:14,565
One, two, three, go!

41
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:17,956
- [Audience] Seven, six, five, four

42
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:19,289
three, two, one.

43
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:22,857
- [Audience Member] Devan!

44
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:23,690
- I did eight.

45
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,766
- I think he did eight.

46
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:27,284
Who can drink a water bottle the fastest?

47
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:29,362
Three, two, cheers, go, go, count!

48
00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:32,279
- [Audience] Seven, six, five, four

49
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:34,382
three, two, one

50
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,326
(audience applauding)

51
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:39,857
- I wanna see how many little,

52
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:40,857
I don't know what they're called.

53
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:42,279
What is this over here?

54
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:43,112
- [Woman] Skip-it.

55
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:44,095
- Looks like a medieval nun-chuck or something.

56
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:45,171
Seven countdown, here we go

57
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,579
Starting right now, go

58
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:50,893
- [Audience] Seven, six, five, four, three

59
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:51,989
- [Collins] No!

60
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,239
(audience laughing)

61
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,148
- You good?

62
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:55,210
- Alright cool, Devan won.

63
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,650
- He won, I didn't even get, I didn't even do one.

64
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,170
- Dude, I literally almost just died.

65
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,069
I just literally cut my finger up just now, on that.

66
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,902
That was just great.

67
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:04,460
- Did you really? Oh I'm sorry bro.

68
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,823
- Hashtag blood, sweat, and tears for these videos bro.

69
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:08,506
- Do an interpretation dance,

70
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:12,581
as though your body was taken over by "the others."

71
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:14,559
- So basically, just dance how I normally dance?

72
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,392
- Yeah I guess.

73
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:17,975
(upbeat music)

74
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:34,189
- Whoa, give it up for Collins Key, what?

75
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,070
- Next up Devan, you have seven seconds

76
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,021
to successfully do a cartwheel.

77
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:41,104
Seven, six, five, four...

78
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:46,367
- High five as many fans as possible.

79
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:48,584
- Guys, put up your hands like this,

80
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:49,690
so we can see if we can do this.

81
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,900
Here we go, go!

82
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,067
(both counting aloud)

83
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:57,919
22!

84
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,818
- No, I lost!

85
00:02:58,818 --> 00:02:59,651
- 22 hands

86
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,484
- No!

87
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,769
- So I see we've got some weights over here

88
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,391
and you know what, we don't usually get to do

89
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:06,988
a challenge live, so we don't get to see...

90
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:09,443
What do you guys want us to do with these weights right now?

91
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:10,364
Just yell it out.

92
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:11,633
Juggle!

93
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,424
- Alright, you guys count down. Alright?

94
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:14,257
- Countdown.

95
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:15,090
- Starting...

96
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,056

97
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:18,973

00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,192

00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:25,699
(Audience cheering)

100
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,800
