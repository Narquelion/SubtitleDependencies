1
00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:01,568
- You know, they said one piece.

2
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,425
Technically, that was one really, really long piece.

3
00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:05,354
- I can't keep talking.

4
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:08,058
My jaw cannot move enough to talk.

5
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:08,956
- Sup, fam?

6
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:09,912
How you doing?

7
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:10,775
My name's Gabriel.

8
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:11,608
- And I'm Jess.

9
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:12,958
- And I know what you're thinking.

10
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,500
Where's Collins and who are we?

11
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,919
(upbeat music)

12
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:18,856
So we're gonna make him appear because we're

13
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:21,802
magicians too, so here goes nothing.

14
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:22,660
Ready?

15
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,780
(buzzing)

16
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,727
- Woah!

17
00:00:24,727 --> 00:00:26,102
- Oh my god!

18
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:27,324
(laughing)

19
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:28,157
What?

20
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:30,844
- Yo, so what's up guys and welcome to today's video.

21
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:33,230
Now this is a very special video because

22
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,006
I was initially gonna do the boyfriend versus girlfriend

23
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:38,315
but things have escalated very quickly and

24
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,677
she is now engaged.

25
00:00:39,677 --> 00:00:40,595
Well, they're both engaged.

26
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:41,428
That's how it works, right?

27
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:42,667
- Yeah sure, I just don't have a ring.

28
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,838
I get a ring when I'm married.

29
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:44,946
- I had no idea about this.

30
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:45,779
(laughing)

31
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:46,796
Single life, ay.

32
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,915
I don't know about any of this stuff,

33
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,413
so today we are gonna be putting them

34
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:53,195
head to head and testing to see who knows

35
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:55,103
their relationship better.

36
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:57,035
I've prepared some questions and we're gonna see

37
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,451
just kinda how this goes.

38
00:00:58,451 --> 00:00:59,544
How do you think it's gonna go?

39
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:01,085
- I think I know more,

40
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:02,609
so I think I'm gonna win.

41
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,099
- I think so too.

42
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,480
- There is a consequence and if you get the question wrong,

43
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,868
the other person gets to put a piece of tape on your face

44
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:12,735
and so by the end of this, one of you guys

45
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:14,116
is gonna be looking really funny.

46
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,787
Now we also filmed a video over on Gabriel's channel

47
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:18,572
and they also have a vlog channel together,

48
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:19,677
so make sure you guys go check that out.

49
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:20,926
We put the links down in the description.

50
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:22,198
Also, right over there.

51
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:23,411
I did some crazy magic for them

52
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:24,994
and their reactions were priceless

53
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:26,517
so go watch those right after this.

54
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:28,994
Make sure you guys go subscribe to both of those channels

55
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:30,779
because these guys, Gabriel's the homie, man.

56
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:33,484
I remember when he first told me about Jess

57
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:34,317
because they did-

58
00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:35,150
- Really?

59
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,983
- I won't go into too much,

60
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:39,555
but they met over Instagram and now it's...

61
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:40,388
- Put a ring on it, yo.

62
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:42,040
- Put a ring on it, for real.

63
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,755
Give the video a thumbs up if you wanna

64
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:45,644
have a relationship like Gabriel and Jess

65
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:47,248
cause I know I do.

66
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:48,747
If I do another one of these videos

67
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:51,242
where it's boyfriend versus girlfriend,

68
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:52,926
who is another couple you'd love to see me do that with?

69
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:55,338
Comment their names down below and right now I'd say,

70
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:56,829
without any further ado,

71
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:00,765
let's just jump right in and this is the

72
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:02,353
now fiance versus fiance.

73
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:03,186
- Woo.

74
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:04,029
- There we go.

75
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:04,862
- Let's do it.

76
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:06,611
Basically there are two parts to this challenge.

77
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:09,667
Part number one is gonna be a speed rally

78
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,828
so I'm gonna ask you a question.

79
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:11,661
- What?

80
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:12,494
- I'll go, "Three, two, one."

81
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:14,403
Whoever can say it first and fastest,

82
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:16,229
they win that round.

83
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:17,062
- What? Okay.

84
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:18,073
- Actually, I'm just gonna say the question.

85
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:20,270
Whoever says it first, like I could be mid-question.

86
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,708
If you already know where I'm going with it,

87
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,541
then you can say.

88
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,374
- Oh, god.

89
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:24,919
- This is all about speed right now, so here we go.

90
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,465
Question number one, where did you first meet?

91
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:28,298
(incoherent mumbling)

92
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:29,131
- Oh wait.

93
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:31,756
- Instagram technically, but her cousin's house.

94
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:33,677
Her front door when she slammed the door in my face.

95
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:34,635
- What?

96
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:35,468
- True story.

97
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:37,537
I knock on the door, she comes up.

98
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:39,725
She opens the door and goes, "Hold on one second."

99
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,894
Slams the door back in my face as I was about to say,

100
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,885
"Hey, how you doing, how are you?".

101
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,209
Wow.

102
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,042
I thought to myself.

103
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,691
I was like, "Oh wow, she's really not interested

104
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:48,886
"if she's gonna pull that crap."

105
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:49,852
- Yeah, right? (laughing)

106
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:52,160
You win round one so you get to go...

107
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,993
- Let's do this.

108
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:53,826
- You get to go for the tape.

109
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:54,659
- And it's just one piece, right?

110
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:55,492
- Oh.

111
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:57,325
- Yeah, one piece per.

112
00:02:58,533 --> 00:02:59,811
- Wow, thank you so much.

113
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:00,842
- I'm a good fiance.

114
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:02,133
- Oh my gosh.

115
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:03,397
- I feel so weird right now.

116
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:04,230
- Next question.

117
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,911
This might go along with your first question,

118
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:07,724
but where was your first date?

119
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:09,530
- Three, two, one. - Malibu and Santa Monica.

120
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,476
Why did I say three, two, one?

121
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:12,968
- Three, two. One. (laughing)

122
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:13,801
Where was it?

123
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:16,123
- Malibu and then we went and had dinner in Santa Monica.

124
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:17,006
- Here's the tape.

125
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:17,839
- All right, there we go.

126
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:19,226
- Feel like I'm gonna be nicer.

127
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:20,059
- That's fine.

128
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,041
(laughing)

129
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,994
- Well, I am so happy that I am just really the host

130
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:26,486
for this challenge and I'm not taking part.

131
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:28,538
Next question, we'll get a little bit more intimate.

132
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:30,214
When was the first kiss?

133
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:31,047
- First kiss?

134
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:31,880
February 21st. - February 21st.

135
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,655
(ding)

136
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:35,249
2016, 2016.

137
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,082
- No, that was a tie.

138
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,205
You gets get to put a piece of tape on me.

139
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:39,065
- Yes.

140
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:40,109
I say we do that, all right?

141
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:40,942
Why did I do this?

142
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:41,906
This was a terrible idea.

143
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:43,111
This is not lit.

144
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:44,044
(laughing)

145
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:45,919
Breathing out of my nose, who needs that?

146
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,146
(laughing)

147
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:48,205
Suffocation?

148
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:49,584
I've heard it's great.

149
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:50,889
- We're all lookin' good.

150
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:52,333
- All right here we go, next one.

151
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,228
First impression of each other.

152
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:55,061
- Okay.

153
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,613
- She slammed the door in my face, she was rude.

154
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,963
- And I thought you, wait, how does that work?

155
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:00,020
- I guess he won.

156
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,371
- Oh really?

157
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:02,427
- Oh she's getting one too, yes.

158
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:03,769
- [Gabriel] It's the best move.

159
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,172
- I look so squished.

160
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:07,075
- When did you first meet Jess' family?

161
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:08,283
- When he went to Australia in July.

162
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:09,691
(ding)

163
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:10,576
- Well played, tape him.

164
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:11,811
- Okay, over my eye?

165
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:12,758
- Your eyebrows.

166
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:13,923
- Bring it back around, do another loop.

167
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:15,579
- Yep, there we go.

168
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:16,465
- Sexy.

169
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,298
- Oh yeah.

170
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,653
Who was the first one to say I love you?

171
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:19,697
- Him. - I was.

172
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:21,560
- Oh, I think she got that first.

173
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,393
- Did she?

174
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:23,226
(laughing)

175
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,059
- I watched the instant replay.

176
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:25,226
- Him. - I was.

177
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:28,914
- After consulting the instant goals replay,

178
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:31,771
Jess said it first so she gets to tape Gabriel again.

179
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,891
- I can't even laugh.

180
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:34,376
If I smile, I'm just like.

181
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:35,900
- Do you remember when it was?

182
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,845
- Right underneath the Hollywood sign the last day

183
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,678
before she left on her first trip.

184
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:43,050
- That is so romantic.

185
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,842
Can we just take a, that is so romantic.

186
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:45,675
(laughing)

187
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:46,783
This is crazy, all right.

188
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:48,319
- I can't look at you, sweetie.

189
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,733
(laughing)

190
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,245
- Zero to 100 real quick right there.

191
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:53,224
All right, here we go.

192
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:54,900
We've now concluded the lightning round

193
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,853
part of this challenge.

194
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:58,318
Now we are on to the whiteboard part.

195
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:00,399
That's a terrible title for this part of the challenge.

196
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,268
This is the part of the challenge

197
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,606
where we can't just yell it out anymore.

198
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,031
How this works is I'm gonna be asking

199
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:07,370
a question like, I don't know, what your favorite food is

200
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,297
and then they're each gonna write down the answer

201
00:05:09,297 --> 00:05:11,070
of what they think it is for the other person

202
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,296
and we'll go like that so.

203
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:14,289
- I'll write down her favorite food.

204
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:15,122
- Yeah, so-

205
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:15,955
- And I write down his.

206
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:17,160
- Yeah exactly, so how this works is this gets

207
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,846
progressively more difficult because let's say

208
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:20,151
they both get it wrong.

209
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:21,762
They each have to put a piece of tape

210
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:22,979
on the other person's face.

211
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,086
This challenge, it'll be a lot more tape going everywhere.

212
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:26,192
Let's kick it off and let's just

213
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,634
go with that one, their favorite food.

214
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:28,467
- Favorite food?

215
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:29,300
- Go for it.

216
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,133
- Oh no.

217
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:30,966
- This is gonna happen,

218
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:32,159
you guys are both gonna say your favorite foods,

219
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,477
turn around the boards at the same time

220
00:05:33,477 --> 00:05:35,000
and hopefully they match up.

221
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,010
- I know I have it wrong.

222
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,915
- There we go, three two one go.

223
00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:38,626
- Pizza. - Hamburgers.

224
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:39,459
Ugh.

225
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:41,657
- I just got it.

226
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:43,078
- I guess that's a piece of tape for Gabriel right there.

227
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:46,330
- Ugh, let me just erase my winning board real quick.

228
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,319
- You've never told me that

229
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,633
your favorite food is hamburgers.

230
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,150
- Well what do I order at every restaurant?

231
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,251
- Not a hamburger.

232
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,748
Is this not goals right now?

233
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:53,681
- No, this is goals.

234
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:54,773
- Oh, doesn't feel like it.

235
00:05:54,773 --> 00:05:55,840
- So goals.

236
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,099
- If you're sitting in front of the TV,

237
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,516
what is that person watching?

238
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,416
Oh she's on this one.

239
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,485
She's got it like immediately.

240
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:04,725
- I know what she's writing but there's two for her.

241
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,225
- Three, two, one.

242
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:09,576
So I think it was way too confusing to have

243
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:10,883
both people turn around their boards

244
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:11,963
and say the things at the same time

245
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:13,751
so we're gonna go one by one right now.

246
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,643
We're gonna see Gabriel first.

247
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,658
Say your favorite show and Jess you can

248
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:18,880
show him what you wrote down,

249
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,797
so what's your favorite show?

250
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:20,731
- Okay, ready?

251
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:21,564
Three, two, one.

252
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:22,397
How to Get Away with Murder.

253
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:23,230
(gasp)

254
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,063
- No.

255
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:25,379
- Woah, The Office?

256
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,629
- This is your favorite show.

257
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:29,106
- That is my favorite show, but I've watched it all

258
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:30,704
so now I'm on another show.

259
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,247
- Wow, all right.

260
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:33,080
Now it's your turn, Jess.

261
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,538
What show would you be watching on TV?

262
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:36,371
Three, two, one.

263
00:06:36,371 --> 00:06:37,204
- Monk.

264
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:38,149
(buzzer)

265
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:38,982
- What the frick?

266
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:39,819
(laughing)

267
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,687
I know it's your favorite TV show,

268
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:43,629
but if we're sitting in front of the TV-

269
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:45,575
- I know, we are watching that at the moment both.

270
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:47,771
- [Gabriel] That's why my answer was for both of us.

271
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:48,604
We're both like-

272
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:50,016
- [Jess] But Monk is my favorite show.

273
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:51,706
- But he didn't say favorite show.

274
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:53,236
- [Jess] But that's how I took it.

275
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:54,523
- Since they both got it wrong,

276
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:56,129
they get another piece of tape on me.

277
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,761
I don't know why that makes sense logically at all,

278
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:58,723
but that's what we're gonna do

279
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:00,659
cause I'm feeling left out of this challenge.

280
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:01,768
Oh no.

281
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:03,092
- The same thing here, right?

282
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:04,161
This is how you did it I think.

283
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:06,468
- I feel like I'm gonna get the worst out of this challenge.

284
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,828
- You know, they said one piece.

285
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,616
Technically, that was one really really long piece.

286
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:11,558
- I can't keep talking.

287
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:14,257
My mouth, my jaw cannot move enough to talk

288
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:16,811
and I'm the host of this and I can't even talk.

289
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,752
All right, here we go.

290
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:20,222
All right, what kind of dressing do I get on a salad?

291
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,747
- Do you?

292
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,076
- No, no, no, you guys, sorry.

293
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:23,909
(laughing)

294
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,718
Like if the other person gets dressing on a salad,

295
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:27,027
what would it be?

296
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:27,894
You say it first.

297
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:28,727
What is it?

298
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:29,560
Three, two, one.

299
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,393
- No dressing.

300
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:32,686
- Ooh, that's impressive.

301
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,255
- Oh I don't even know yours, I'm sorry.

302
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:35,088
- Okay, ready?

303
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,116
- All right, here you go, three two one.

304
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:36,949
- Ranch.

305
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:38,857
(gasps)

306
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:39,832
- Oh, way to go babe.

307
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:40,760
- Congratulate, wait.

308
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,593
- Goals.

309
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:43,468
- No, I have to get another piece of, no.

310
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:44,301
(laughing)

311
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,134
- [Gabriel] I'm gonna erase that.

312
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:46,059
- I literally won't be able to do anything

313
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:47,059
after this piece of tape.

314
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:47,992
Really, really just-

315
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:49,075
- Oh my gosh.

316
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:51,666
- Really just how am I losing the worst?

317
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,740
All I'm saying is I don't know what happened.

318
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,172
I literally thought for the first time,

319
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:58,181
I am actually gonna be free from these challenges.

320
00:07:58,181 --> 00:07:59,926
And now I just look constantly inquisitive.

321
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:00,759
All right, here we go.

322
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,815
What's one food the other person doesn't like?

323
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,370
Ya'll better get this right cause if ya don't, I'm screwed.

324
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,609
- What's one thing you don't like?

325
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,132
Hold on, time out, time out, time out.

326
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:10,720
She has to flip it around and I have to confirm

327
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,318
like yeah, that is one thing that I don't like.

328
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:14,899
- Okay, all right, go for it, three two one.

329
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:15,973
- Vegemite, true.

330
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:18,052
I don't like Vegemite.

331
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:18,885
- Congratulations.

332
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:19,718
Flip yours around, go for it.

333
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:20,635
What is it?

334
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:23,165
- Hawaiian pizza, I don't know.

335
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,290
(buzzer)

336
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,572
- That's a random answer, but all right.

337
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,984
- I like Hawaiian pizza.

338
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,560
- Ooh, I am putting some tape on Gabriel.

339
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,588
This is game over.

340
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,106
- Dude, you're closing my ear.

341
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:34,996
You're just taping my ear shut.

342
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:35,829
And...

343
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:38,665
(laughing)

344
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:42,332
- What size shoe does the other person wear?

345
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:47,069
- Done.

346
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:47,975
- Done, all right, here we go.

347
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,373
What size shoe does Gabriel wear?

348
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:50,356
Turn around, three two one.

349
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:51,189
- Ten and a half.

350
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:52,022
(ding)

351
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:52,855
- Bam, nailed it.

352
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:53,688
You?

353
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:54,521
Oh no, please don't be the same.

354
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:55,354
Oh gosh, what is it?

355
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:56,187
Go, three two one.

356
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,020
- Eight.

357
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,853
(ding)

358
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:58,686
- No!

359
00:08:58,686 --> 00:08:59,519
Ya'll better be giving this video a thumbs up

360
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,353
for the fact that I have just, I've lost.

361
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:02,820
- [Gabriel] Oh my god.

362
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,653
- Right?

363
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:05,253
(laughing)

364
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,086
- All right guys,

365
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,368
it was all fun and games in the beginning

366
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:09,031
but now I just literally look like a monster,

367
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,768
so I'm gonna just take this stuff off real quick

368
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:12,104
and we're gonna go back to just you guys

369
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:13,678
having tape on your face cause this is,

370
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,970
I look terrifying.

371
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,811
- [Male Voice] Weak.

372
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:17,408
- All right, on to the next round.

373
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,611
- On to the next round.

374
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:19,860
- Now that I don't look like a demon.

375
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,901
- If the other person collects an item or something,

376
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:24,318
what would it be?

377
00:09:25,686 --> 00:09:26,854
- I got it.

378
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:28,595
- But I don't even know my answer.

379
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:30,178
- [Gabriel] You do.

380
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,367
- This is so wrong.

381
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,062
- All right, what is it?

382
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:34,895
- Calendars.

383
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:37,097
- All right, that sounds really weird.

384
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:37,930
- But she does.

385
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,649
- I don't collect calendars, I just print a lot.

386
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:40,482
- Is that right?

387
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:41,315
- Shoes?

388
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,148
That's what I was gonna say.

389
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,204
I was gonna say clothes and shoes.

390
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:44,037
- All right, cool.

391
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:44,870
Well since I'm not out of the challenge,

392
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,140
no tape on me, no one gets tape on their face

393
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,873
and we're on to the next round, yeah.

394
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:50,204
Since it's the final round, we're doing a speed round,

395
00:09:50,204 --> 00:09:52,023
no more whiteboards, right now.

396
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,441
What is the other person's middle name?

397
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:54,723
- Marie.

398
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:55,556
- Ugh.

399
00:09:55,556 --> 00:10:00,323
- Gabriel for the finale, win on that so Gabriel,

400
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:02,632
you get to put the final piece of tape on Jess,

401
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:04,851
but first make sure you guys go check out the video

402
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:06,266

406
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,562

00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:15,707
I love you guys so much and now...

408
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:16,547
- Please be nice.

409
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:18,208
Oh my gosh.

410
