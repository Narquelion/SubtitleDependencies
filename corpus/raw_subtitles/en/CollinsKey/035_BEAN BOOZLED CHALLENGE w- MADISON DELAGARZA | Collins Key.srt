1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,177
- What's up guys, it's Collins Key

2
00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:03,879
and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,318
We're already laughing and the video

4
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:06,350
hasn't even started yet.

5
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,354
Back by ridiculous popular demand,

6
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:10,738
you guys have been asking for me to do another vlag.

7
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:11,571
Vlag?

8
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:14,069
What!

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,886
Asking me to do another vlog, another legendary collab

10
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,234
with one of my best friends in the entire world,

11
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:23,306
Madison De La Garza.

12
00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:24,139
Yay!

13
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,479
- Shh, it's okay.

14
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:27,312
- Okay.

15
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:28,842
- I've been insanely excited,

16
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:30,128
we've been planing this for a long time.

17
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:32,087
I'm sorry I don't show emotion very well.

18
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:34,836
- I am beyond excited to be shooting this collab right now.

19
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:36,542
For today's video, we are going to be doing

20
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:38,792
the Bean Boozled challenge.

21
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,628
I'll edit so they're like tam-tam-tam.

22
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:45,732
It'll be crazy, all right.

23
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:47,048
(mumbles)

24
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,239
How the Bean Boozled challenge works,

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,072
is basically, there are a ton of different flavored beans

26
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:53,134
and each bean has an identical match.

27
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:55,032
One tastes like liquorice, the other one tastes

28
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:57,299
like skunk spray and whoever gets the most amount

29
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,953
of nasty-tasting flavors, that person looses

30
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:01,745
and the other person gets to tweet something

31
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:02,707
off of their account.

32
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:04,165
And make sure you guys stick around to the end of the video

33
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,045
to find out what the embarrassing tweet is,

34
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,267
but without further ado, let's just jump right into it.

35
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:10,288
Our server is Devon, so Devon please bring--

36
00:01:10,288 --> 00:01:11,131
- [Devon] I'm not your server.

37
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:12,017
- Yes you are, come on over here.

38
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:13,100
- [Devon] I'm not your server.

39
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,933
- Our waiter--

40
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,997
- [Devon] I chose to be here, people.

41
00:01:15,997 --> 00:01:17,077
- First flavor we're going for,

42
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,711
we're going in hard, this one's either a liquorice flavor

43
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:20,961
or a skunk spray.

44
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:23,231
Ladies first, you get to pick out your first flavor of beans

45
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:24,528
and they're all identical, so we don't know.

46
00:01:24,528 --> 00:01:25,361
Here we go.

47
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:26,252
- My heart is actually pounding right now.

48
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,085
- Really?

49
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:28,172
- I'm not kidding, I'm really nervous.

50
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:31,922
- All right, here we go, three, two, one, go.

51
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:46,364
Oh, God, I got skunk spray.

52
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:50,970
I'm literally crying right now.

53
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,608
It's probably on my breath now too, this is nasty.

54
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:54,801
Note to self, if you're ever gonna make out

55
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:57,058
with a girl, never eat this jellybean,

56
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:58,333
or if you want to break up with your girlfriend,

57
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,782
eat this jellybean and then you're like,

58
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:01,199
hey, how are you?

59
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:04,503
- Life hacks with Collins.

60
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:07,114
- The next one is either going to be chocolate pudding

61
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:08,732
or canned dog food.

62
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:10,399
One, two, three, go.

63
00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:15,802
Again, I got to eat it fast.

64
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,937
- You know what, maybe it was canned dog food.

65
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,104
Or it might even be chocolate pudding.

66
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,093
I can't even tell, I don't know what's wrong with me.

67
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:27,760
- Your nose has no taste at all.

68
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:30,018
In music I mean.

69
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,059
This is disgusting.

70
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:35,655
- The next one is toothpaste or berry blue.

71
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,996
- I actually kind of want to eat toothpaste.

72
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:39,027
- Honestly, we deserve a break right now.

73
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:39,860
- Really.

74
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,623
These ones look really pretty too, I like these.

75
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:43,995
- That's like your eyes.

76
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:45,680
- What my eyes taste like?

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,011
That was weird, all right, go.

78
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:49,844
- Toothpaste.

79
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:50,677
- They taste really good though.

80
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:51,510
They actually really do.

81
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,425
- It's like a palate cleanser.

82
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:56,751
- Next one is going to be caramel corn or moldy cheese.

83
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:58,418
One, two, three, go.

84
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:01,804
- Definitely moldy cheese, that's fun.

85
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:03,471
Okay, this is great.

86
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:06,846
This is a fun time, yeah.

87
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:11,943
- Yo, who makes this, who figured out

88
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,320
what moldy cheese tastes like,

89
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,612
that's what I'm really concerned about.

90
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:18,502
Next one is either bugger or juicy pear.

91
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,284
I feel like bugger is gonna be ultra-salty.

92
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,534
Sorry, too far?

93
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:25,637
- You did not.

94
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:26,708
- Go.

95
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,541
- I can't tell.

96
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,374
- I can't tell either.

97
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,124
Either barf or peach.

98
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:32,341
- I know how bad this is,

99
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:33,761
and I'm just waiting for it to happen.

100
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:34,594
- Three--

101
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:35,787
- Please don't make me do this Collins.

102
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,037
- Two, one, go.

103
00:03:44,046 --> 00:03:45,129
What is this?

104
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,511
Oh my God.

105
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:49,608
Keep it together, keep it together,

106
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,697
stay cool, stay cool.

107
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:53,141
I don't think we did enough flavors just then,

108
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,109
I think Devon, you need to come over here,

109
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,036
bring the tray with you, we're just gonna start eating them.

110
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,291
We're just gonna start eating them.

111
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,073
This is just the crazy bonus round,

112
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,514
look at this, look at all those beans.

113
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:04,017
Go for it, just start eating beans.

114
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:05,100
- No, please.

115
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,300
I have a coconut.

116
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,133
- Yay!

117
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:12,163
Bugger or juicy pear?

118
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:16,594
- That's bugger.

119
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:17,958
- Juicy pear.

120
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:18,791
- That's a bugger.

121
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,060
- I'm gonna take a handful right now.

122
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,271
- You're not gonna do that.

123
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,104
- So many.

124
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:25,844
Are those like--

125
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:27,911
- Am I the only one eating them?

126
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,760
- Stop it, stop it.

127
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,456
- Either skunk or liquorice.

128
00:04:31,456 --> 00:04:33,262
Three, two, one, go.

129
00:04:33,262 --> 00:04:35,179
- I still have coconut.

130
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:45,376
(screaming)

131
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:47,043
- Bro, are you okay?

132
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:51,807
- I need all the blue ones.

133
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:52,873
- I need the blue ones.

134
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:55,790
- You can't take all the blue ones.

135
00:04:57,383 --> 00:04:59,431
- We both got skunked, bro.

136
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,329
- I literally feel like I'm gonna throw up.

137
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:03,535
- I can smell the skunk, too.

138
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:05,241
- Oh, my gosh.

139
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:07,032
- Oh, it's rancid.

140
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:08,127
- I don't taste the skunk, though.

141
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:12,959
- Yeah, I know, we smell it, though, we smell it.

142
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,900
- Devon!

143
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,791
- Dude, you're gonna die.

144
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:15,998
- I hate this game.

145
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:17,612
- If this video made you laugh or smile,

146
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:19,907
give it a thumbs up, a little bit of encouragement

147
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:20,837
would be nice.

148
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,904
Comment down bellow, what do you think is the nastiest

149
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:24,837
flavor of jellybeans?

150
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:26,623
Maddie and Devon's social media links are in the description

151
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:27,740
down below, so be sure to follow.

152
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,328
Not really sure who won this challenge,

153
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,365
I think we both lost equally,

154
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,417
so we've each got to have at each other's accounts

155
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,541
and here are the tweets.

156
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,200
I don't know why I laughed.

157
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,799
Maddie, you get to make me disappear right now,

158
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,632
here we go.

159
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,678
- What, how do I do that?

160
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:43,490
This is a big deal for me, okay?

161
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,323
- All right.

162
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:45,819
(laughing)

163
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:48,486
- Sorry, that was really stupid.

164
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:51,264
- Oh, my favorite people ever,

165
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:52,348
I hope you guys enjoyed the video,

166
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:53,795
see you guys again soon, bye!

167
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:54,628
Fudge.
