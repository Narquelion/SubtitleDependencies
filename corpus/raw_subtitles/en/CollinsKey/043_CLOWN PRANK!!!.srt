1
00:00:00,804 --> 00:00:02,958
- [Boy] Dude, dude shut up.

2
00:00:02,958 --> 00:00:03,934
Oh gotta hide.

3
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:05,378
That's the car right there.

4
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:07,775
Our dad's driving but our mom is in there.

5
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:10,185
Oh it's getting real.

6
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:11,243
Turn around, shoot.

7
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:13,356
(laughing)

8
00:00:13,356 --> 00:00:14,741
Oh my god, that was horrible.

9
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:16,369
Alright, here we go, they're walking in.

10
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:17,533
Alright here we go.

11
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:18,807
Okay so this is like, it's terrible.

12
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:20,286
I'm not even in my costume and they're already here.

13
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,703
Okay, here we go.

14
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,512
Cut the camera off.

15
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:26,759
Setting up the shot.

16
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:27,592
- [Camera Guy] Dude don't look like that.

17
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:28,925
You look creepy.

18
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:30,849
- It's time for the mask.

19
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:31,879
This is the mask, mom.

20
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,965
I'm so sorry.

21
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:35,432
Alright guys, so I'm getting into position right now.

22
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:37,671
You have camera number one right over here.

23
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,104
So this is the angle that this camera is getting.

24
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:40,771
So I'm gonna turn this on.

25
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:41,938
You guys good?

26
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:43,798
You good?

27
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:50,179
How do I know when they're coming?

28
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,498
Tell Lindsey to text me when they're like

29
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:53,915
a few feet away from the car.

30
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:17,281
No sign still?

31
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,152
Alright.

32
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:26,504
(police sirens)

33
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:28,336
How are you?

34
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:30,174
Before we go any further, I just wanna clarify something.

35
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,008
Number one, I had no idea going into this

36
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,235
that clowns are more than just

37
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:34,808
a social media trend that was happening.

38
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:36,561
And number two, I didn't get in trouble for doing it

39
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:38,761
but also we can just tell that,

40
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,489
I just absolutely suck at making pranks.

41
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:41,930
I didn't get in trouble luckily for this.

42
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,420
Everything was completely fine.

43
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,462
Everything worked out.

44
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:45,865
That being said, Devan and I right now

45
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:47,426
are gonna watch a whole bunch of clown sightings

46
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:48,519
and clown pranks and kind of see

47
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,986
what's going on with this whole trend.

48
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:50,962
Give this video a thumbs up for

49
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:52,604
the fact that I tried it, I went for it.

50
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:54,278
I tried to pull my very own clown prank

51
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:55,915
but yeah without any further ado,

52
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,204
let's jump right in right now.

53
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,945
A little bit nervous, but right now let's just--

54
00:01:58,945 --> 00:01:59,984
- Yeah let's do it.

55
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,901
- Let's get it started.

56
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:04,696
- I don't like this.

57
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:05,529
I don't--

58
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:06,779
- [Both] Oh no.

59
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:10,073
- [Man] No.

60
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:10,906
No.

61
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:13,106
No.

62
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,850
No, no what are you doing bro?

63
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:20,741
- What is going on?

64
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:24,348
- [Man] Oh (beep)

65
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:25,348
- [Both] Oh.

66
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,738
- [Man] (beep)

67
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:30,571
- Yo.

68
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:33,113
No way.

69
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:35,237
I would freak out so hard if

70
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,781
this was happening on my property.

71
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,021
He's destroying their pumpkins.

72
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:39,881
- What?

73
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,193
- This man is strong.

74
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:43,585
He literally just punched a pumpkin and broke it open.

75
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:46,514
- [Man] I look up, then I see this clown right there.

76
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:48,220
Which freaked me out bro.

77
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,984
How do you even get up there?

78
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:52,690
- That's the wildest one of all.

79
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,523
Why would you do that?

80
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:56,254
(honking)

81
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:58,327
- [Man] What the (honking).

82
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:01,611
What the (honking) you (honking).

83
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:02,696
- I thought that was a clown with a horn.

84
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:05,258
They're bleeping out what he was saying.

85
00:03:05,258 --> 00:03:07,522
(country music)

86
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:10,459
The music fits so perfectly, oh my gosh.

87
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,137
- [Driver] No no way.

88
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:12,970
- [Boy] Dude get outta here.

89
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,021
Back up back up.

90
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:15,854
Oh my god.

91
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:19,602
He's just going.

92
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:21,169
Oh my god.

93
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:24,284
- He's going back to his home.

94
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:28,340
If you go fast he's not gonna be able to get you.

95
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,673
- [Boy] Oh my god, what the.

96
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,668
- Yo come check out shot man.

97
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:36,790
Are you serious?

98
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,857
Yo go around it bro.

99
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:40,337
Yo go around this fool bro.

100
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:41,170
- No.

101
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,191
- [Man] Go around him bro.

102
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,962
Go around him.

103
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:46,311
For real man, go around him.

104
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,245
Get away.

105
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:49,495
Run him over dog.

106
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,534
- That's what I was thinking.

107
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:53,127
- [Man] I'm not getting out the car bro.

108
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:54,855
- That driver's the worst.

109
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:57,027
- [Man] I'm not getting out the car bro.

110
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:58,793
- And now an actual recreation of what happened

111
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,814
after the guy stopped filming.

112
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:01,647
Ah.

113
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:02,480
(laughing)

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Hey kid, want a balloon?

115
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,210
Don't think I could ever try to blow this thing up,

116
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,975
it's a lot harder than it looks.

117
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,060
It takes so much cheek strength.

118
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,506
Hey kid, what do you want, a dog?

119
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:15,839
Good thing that's what it ought to make.

120
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:18,677
Here's a dog.

121
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,218
- [Woman] This cannot be real.

122
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:23,767
Hold on let me slow down.

123
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:24,973
Roll down the window, roll down the window.

124
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,100
I wanna talk to him.

125
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,933
- Why?

126
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:28,766
- What?

127
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,333
- [Man] This guy's on Twitter too much.

128
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,166
- What?

129
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,459
- [Woman] Hey, oh god he's running, he's running.

130
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:34,691
He's chasing us.

131
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,403
Oh my god, he's (mumbles).

132
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:41,570
- These clowns are gonna get hit one day, I swear.

133
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,300
- [Girl] I'm scared.

134
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,989
- Well yeah.

135
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:47,885
- At least the movement is a little bit different.

136
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:49,107
The rest of the clowns are wide,

137
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:51,190
this guy is kind of like,

138
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,638
he's kind of iguana crawling around.

139
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:56,971
Iguana crawling.

140
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:01,518
(suspenseful music)

141
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:02,377
They added the music.

142
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:04,014
- That music is just too much.

143
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:06,527
- Why is he doing yoga right now?

144
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:08,944
This is the first yoga clown.

145
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:13,673
After all that build up, he doesn't explode

146
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:16,333
or multiply in multiple clowns.

147
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,509
- [Woman] Turn this stupid radio off.

148
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:19,890
Justin, no get back in the car.

149
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,577
- He's like the guy in every horror movie who dies first.

150
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:24,196
The opening scene of every horror movie,

151
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:26,182
he's like, let me go check out what this is.

152
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:27,015
And then he dies.

153
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,651
It's that man in real life.

154
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:30,912
No, no.

155
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:32,682
- Why roll up next to him, man?

156
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:33,515
Why?

157
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:34,348
- Wow.

158
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:35,598
- Oh okay good.

159
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:39,114
- I'm not buying the whole Slender-man act.

160
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:40,159
- Uh uh.

161
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,498
- [Man] I just wanna finish dude.

162
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:42,946
- Wait, did he say, do you wanna finish?

163
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,117
What did he say?

164
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:45,842
- I thought he said, just let me finish.

165
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:46,922
I thought he was using the bathroom.

166
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:48,216
He's like please let me finish.

167
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:50,485
- [Man] Clowns walking around Allen town, look,

168
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:52,820
on hover boards, look.

169
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,333
- They're still creepy.

170
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,278
- Haters gonna say it's fake.

171
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:58,955
- How does he know where to point the camera,

172
00:05:58,955 --> 00:06:00,297
that's my question.

173
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:02,972
- [Man] Get it on Snapchat, get it on Snapchat.

174
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:04,488
- [Man] No this can't be real.

175
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:05,362
- I agree with the man who's like,

176
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:07,355
this can't be real, because guys,

177
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:08,938
this can't be real.

178
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:11,918
It can't be.

179
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,019
- [Girl] Okay so we think we just saw

180
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,460
a clown go into the bushes.

181
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,293
- Ya did.

182
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,204
- [Girl] We're not exactly sure,

183
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:20,704
so we're gonna go investigate.

184
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,876
- [Girl] Delaney I know you're scared, bug off.

185
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:26,109
- [Girl] Shh, you guys be quiet.

186
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:27,305
- Oh.

187
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:30,143
(screaming)

188
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,073
- The clown's way faster than those girls.

189
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:32,906
- Oh my god.

190
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:34,262
- They're not gonna, they're not gonna,

191
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:36,328
yeah that clown's way faster.

192
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:39,068
- [Man] We're here in Ohio and I think we just saw

193
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:41,994
one of those killer clown things.

194
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:44,459
- And so we're gonna go investigate, brilliant.

195
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,440
- [Man] So I'm out here in Palm Springs, California.

196
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,796
And my brother said he just saw a clown somewhere

197
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:54,031
in my apartment but I really don't believe him.

198
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:54,864
- I thought he was gonna turn it

199
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,123
and there'd be a clown right there.

200
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,389
- [Man] I'm out here looking at sun down.

201
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:58,950
- [Boy] He had red hair.

202
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,847
There, there look look, he's right there.

203
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:02,955
Go.

204
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:03,788
Run.

205
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,199
- Yeah I'm that little kid right there.

206
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,116
- [Man] We saw a clown.

207
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:23,760
That's him, that's him.

208
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,753
Bro oh my gosh.

209
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:27,027
(crashing)

210
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:28,265
- So a couple of those were pretty creepy,

211
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:29,807
but for the most part, Devan and I are still

212
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:32,228
rather skeptical about the whole clown sighting thing.

213
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:33,983
We have a bunch of news clips here

214
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,289
and this might change our minds.

215
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,789
So let's just see.

216
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,323
(screaming)

217
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:41,349
- [Reporter] This Snapchat video of that creepy clown

218
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:44,088
standing right outside Shareeta Maston's apartment.

219
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,772
It waved what looks like a knife,

220
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:47,194
before it skampered away.

221
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:48,849
Shareeta says she was with her 11 year old cousin,

222
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:51,501
when she spotted the clown at the BP station across

223
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,469
the street, so she ran home.

224
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:55,348
- I left her and then by the time we got here,

225
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:56,767
we turned around and was closing the door.

226
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,967
It was standing right here in front of,

227
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:01,335
right here, with the knife just waving it at us,

228
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:02,168
through the window.

229
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:03,001
- [Reporter] That's when they took

230
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:03,834
this video through the blinds.

231
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,527
They took a second Snapchat video

232
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,094
from a side window as well.

233
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:07,927
- [Shareeta] It was scary.

234
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:09,246
- [Reporter] He called out the helicopter

235
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:11,063
because this was so serious, to help

236
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:12,998
search for this clown, but they couldn't find him.

237
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:16,726
They're looking for a clown with orange hair,

238
00:08:16,726 --> 00:08:19,251
white paint on his face, red lips

239
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,401
and he was wearing a rainbow suit.

240
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,418
- These clowns are terrifying.

241
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:24,620
- [Reporter] A clown wearing white with red hair

242
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,857
came out from behind some trees near her house.

243
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:27,165
And was staring at her.

244
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:28,814
A deputy tells us another man called from

245
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:31,316
that same neighborhood, saying a clown had chased

246
00:08:31,316 --> 00:08:33,626
his child and some friends when they got

247
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:35,350
off of their school bus.

248
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,044
- [Reporter] You are looking at cell phone video

249
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,507
of a person dressed in a clown suit,

250
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:43,158
trespassing at the Rosehill cemetery in the dead of night.

251
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:44,561
- It's pretty sick, it's creepy.

252
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:46,855
- [Reporter] Julia Graham was quote, freaked out,

253
00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:48,983
when she figured out what the image was

254
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:51,684
that she saw running towards the cemetery main gate.

255
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:55,058
- And when we get closer we realize it's a clown.

256
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:56,478
- The first picture her husband snapped

257
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:59,081
was of the clown scaling the main gate

258
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,740
at the Ravenswood avenue entrance.

259
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,059
Not an easy climb for anyone,

260
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,445
let alone someone in a clown costume.

261
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:06,157
It happened around 10 o'clock,

262
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:08,193
when the cemetery was clearly closed

263
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:09,176
and locked for the night.

264
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:10,887
Cemetery officials wouldn't go on camera,

265
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,491
but CBS two did show them the video--

266
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:13,373
- Dude what the--

267
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:15,874
- What a ending technique, wow.

268
00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:17,907
Special effects on fleek, it looked like

269
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,171
the clown was really there.

270
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:20,536
- [Man] Oh my god.

271
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:22,376
- [Reporter] Videos and photos of creepy clowns

272
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:24,789
surprising people on the streets of California

273
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:27,042
at night, went viral last year.

274
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:28,315
- [Man] Oh my god.

275
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:30,037
- [Reporter] And in New York, more of the same.

276
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,435
But again, for some reason, in cemeteries.

277
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:34,248
Eventually the clown was caught in the headlights

278
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:37,537
of Grahams car, turns around and without saying a word,

279
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:39,331
takes off into the darkness.

280
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:43,745
- What if he just said one word, was like, pandas and ran.

281
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:45,103
- Eek eek.

282
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:46,554
- The creepy clown sightings

283
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:49,253
have been increasing across the country recently.

284
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:51,082
Due to recent social media threats

285
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:53,166
from anonymous clown accounts,

286
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,470
Suffolk County school districts

287
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,827
are not taking any chances.

288
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:59,552
After one of the anonymous Long Island clown

289
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:03,177
Twitter accounts threatened Lindon Hurst Friday morning,

290
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:05,157
the students here at this elementary school

291
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:07,406
weren't allowed outside during recess.

292
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,777
The clowning pranks a disturbing trend sweeping

293
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:12,621
our area and the country with violent threats--

294
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:13,579
- Those eyes.

295
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,162
- [Reporter] And countless accounts.

296
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:17,695
- Well.

297
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:20,892
I don't quite know what to make of those videos.

298
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:23,024
Some of them are definitely fake--

299
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,537
- I'd say there's probably like five real ones.

300
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:25,816
- If that, if that.

301
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:28,200
Some of those seem like they could very well be real.

302
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,607
So let us know what you guys think

303
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:31,415
in the comments down below.

304
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:34,470
And if you see a scary clown,

please be super safe.

306
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,560
- Just run, reverse.

307
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,324
Listen to your other friends who are in the car.

308
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:40,577
- Do not film it.

309
00:10:40,577 --> 00:10:42,655
Oh my gosh yeah, whatever you do, just get out of there.
