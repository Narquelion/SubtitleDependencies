1
00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:00,998
- You challenged us --

2
00:00:00,998 --> 00:00:01,831
(screaming)

3
00:00:01,831 --> 00:00:04,239
Oh my gosh, the pancake art challenge!

4
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,072
We're kicking off right now

5
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:08,275
with the most requested one and that is, yeet!

6
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,182
It's a me, Mario!

7
00:00:10,182 --> 00:00:11,705
- Oh! - Let's go!

8
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:12,538
- Yeah!

9
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:13,371
- I'm going for the arm first,

10
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:14,672
because no one ever does that.

11
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:15,505
Okay, boom.

12
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:16,505
We got the blue!

13
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:18,289
Okay, there we go, that's his little overall,

14
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:20,331
now I got the full body, oh my gosh!

15
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:21,456
My dude's starting to look more

16
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:23,410
like SpongeBob than he is Mario.

17
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,958
I'm making SpongeBob!

18
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,425
I got buttons.

19
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:27,258
- Button.

20
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:28,507
- Button.

21
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:30,458
(upbeat music)

22
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,234
You're only on the little face, bro?

23
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,224
- Bro, he looks like Wario.

24
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:36,621
- What, no, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

25
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:39,374
(upbeat music)

26
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:40,629
And now, for the mouth.

27
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:41,843
It might blend in with his mustache,

28
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:43,266
but we're going with it!

29
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,508
I'm even gonna add so many details,

30
00:00:44,508 --> 00:00:45,553
he's gonna have little knuckles.

31
00:00:45,553 --> 00:00:46,474
Where'd my spatula go?

32
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:48,117
(rewind)

33
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:49,137
Yeet!

34
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:50,925
Oh okay cool, I'll be right back.

35
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,541
And now it's the moment of truth:

36
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,805
the flip of Mario.

37
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:55,924
I didn't know my voice actually could go that high.

38
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:56,921
How high can my voice go?

39
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:57,972
(wheezes)

40
00:00:57,972 --> 00:00:59,419
- What?

41
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:00,429
(screams)

42
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:01,321
(screams)

43
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:02,154
- Ow!

44
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:02,987
(screams)

45
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:04,487
- It's-a me, Mario

46
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,092
- It's-a me, Mario

47
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:08,202
- Bro, what are you doing?

48
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,333
I need to flip my pancake!

49
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,813
- No! You're interrupting me!

50
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:11,880
- You're interrupting my flip!

51
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,856
Alright, here's comes the flip.

52
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:14,189
Three, two, one!

53
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,539
Oh!

54
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:19,036
- His arm flew off!

55
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:20,455
- Yeah but look at that face!

56
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,065
Yo, I think I might have taken the win on this one.

57
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:23,898
Where did my arm go?

58
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:24,936
Bro, look at those knuckles.

59
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:28,013
(upbeat music)

60
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:29,222
- Oh dear.

61
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,085
I'm not excited for this one.

62
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:32,242
I think this might be the worst one I've ever made.

63
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:34,325
Alright, three, two, one.

64
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,699
Oh no! I ripped off his leg!

65
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:39,143
- Well you ripped off his leg and his arm.

66
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:41,579
I only lost an arm, so I basically won

67
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:42,737
because I got one more limb.

68
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:43,653
- What?

69
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:44,887
- You guys get to comment down below

70
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:47,112
and let us know who won this round.

71
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:48,599
And at the end of this we'll be eating

72
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,184
all of these pancakes.

73
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:51,332
Next up is BB-8.

74
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:52,553
Three, two, one, begin!

75
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:53,693
- This one's going to be very tough.

76
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:57,969
Why does my hand always end up with Pam on it, bro?

77
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:00,308
- Alright, I think I have a rather unique method here,

78
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:01,480
and I think I'm gonna capitalize on it

79
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,945
and then take home the W.

80
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:03,937
If you guys didn't know,

81
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:05,727
that's for winner, winner, chicken dinner.

82
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,357
I think my BB-8 quite honestly is almost done.

83
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:10,357
The only last thing to do is just --

84
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:15,396
Oh man, this is getting tricky in these little parts here.

85
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:16,229
Ahh!

86
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:19,716
- Ahh!

87
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:21,667
- I don't know if I have enough finger strength

88
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:22,836
to pull this whole thing off.

89
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:23,669
- I believe in you, Collins.

90
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:24,525
The force is with you!

91
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:25,358
- Thank you!

92
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:26,684
(mumbles)

93
00:02:26,684 --> 00:02:27,517
- What are you saying?

94
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:28,350
(rewind)

95
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,183
(mumbles)

96
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,660
- Ah! Did it!

97
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,048
So I'm gonna do a little Kylo Ren,

98
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:34,266
and then last but not least

99
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,907
you can't forget the iconic saber.

100
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:37,740
There we go, Boom.

101
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,803
Kylo Ren.

102
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:40,299
Time to flip BB-8.

103
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:41,632
Three, two, one.

104
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:47,247
Oh snap, It looks like a burnt egg!

105
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:48,630
- Whoa, dude! What?

106
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,152
- Alright and now for the one of course

107
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:52,018
you've all been waiting for, Kylo Ren.

108
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:53,666
Alright, let's see if I can get, oh my gosh,

109
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,265
his little light, his little saber.

110
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:56,234
Kylo Ren's very powerful,

111
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:57,920
and therefore he's gonna have a very powerful flip.

112
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,253
Three, two, one.

113
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:03,079
Oh, he's hot!

114
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,847
- There's stuff on the ceiling now, bro!

115
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:05,680
- Oh.

116
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,169
- Alright it's time for the final part,

117
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,151
and that is adding the white.

118
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:12,051
- This is gonna be the flip of the Millennium Falcon.

119
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:14,030
- Well, here we go.

120
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,363
Three, two, one.

121
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:17,874
Wait--

122
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:20,644
- Oh my gosh, that looks terrible.

123
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:21,808
You definitely lost.

124
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:22,743
- It really does.

125
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:24,309
- Alright guys, so again you get to

126
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:25,611
comment down below and vote.

127
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:28,440
Let us know who won this round of BB-8.

128
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,382
I would say it's a toss up for sure.

129
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:32,916
For this round, we're making the Grinch who stole Christmas.

130
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,525
He took all of Christmas and was like, yay!

131
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:36,649
So right now, let's begin.

132
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,452
- Okay wait I have to Pam this up, bro.

133
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,394
- Oh, I forgot to use Pam.

134
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:40,404
- Do you want me to Pam it?

135
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:41,948
- No!

136
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:43,252
- I pammed you.

137
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:45,192
- So he's got like some little beady little yellow eyes.

138
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,114
They're like (growls)

139
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:47,453
- He looks like a little alien!

140
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:49,017
- The Grinch is an alien, right?

141
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,874
So now we're gonna do the eyebrows,

142
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:52,720
which quite honestly they like pop off his head.

143
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,044
- He actually looks really happy in a very evil way.

144
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:57,379
I mean, you got that right about the Grinch.

145
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,534
(upbeat music)

146
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,034
- And we are done!

147
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:04,619
Well, Devan's finished just about his eye so far.

148
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,053
- It's turning out saucy.

149
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,412
- And now it's time for me to flip my pancake.

150
00:04:08,412 --> 00:04:10,829
- [Together] Three, two, one.

151
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:14,556
- That looks, oh my gosh, I'm so pleased.

152
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:15,789
- Good job, Collins.

153
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,055
(clapping)

154
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:18,748
- Thank you, thank you.

155
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:20,445
Now I just have to wait forever for you to finish yours.

156
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:21,314
- Yes.

157
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:22,432
- I'm gonna go grab some rice cakes, I'll be back.

158
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:25,015
(upbeat music)

159
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:30,111
- Dude it's almost done!

160
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:30,944
- Yo!

161
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:31,777
I got rice cakes, I'm happy.

162
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:32,856
- Can I have one?

163
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,689
- No.

164
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,188
There are no rice cakes.

165
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,138
- Alright bro, it is time to flip.

166
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:39,060
- Three, two, one. - Three, two, wait!

167
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,749
First, we have a five second subscribe challenge for you.

175
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:02,695

00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,120

177
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,038

178
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:07,555
Dude, like this is crazy!

179
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:08,537
What the heck!

180
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,131
My voice has never been this high before!

181
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,750
Ow!

182
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,156

If I get one win out of this entire thing,

185
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:19,051
on this one, I will be blown away.

186
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,542
This round, we're doing something unprecedented.

187
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,375
- Unprecedented.

188
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,208
- Unprecedented.

189
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,069
We're making like seven different pancakes,

190
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:27,124
stacking them all together to create

191
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:29,181
a pancake burger.

192
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:30,186
- So how do we do this?

193
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:31,019
Do we like --

194
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:31,919
- You have to make them all at the same time.

195
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,960
- What is that, li'l grapes?

196
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,793
- What?

197
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:34,626
- I don't know.

198
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,636
- Have you ever seen a burger?

199
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:36,927
- Not your kind of burger, at least.

200
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:39,100
(upbeat music)

201
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,338
- I think Devan's doing what I thought I was doing.

202
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:43,068
- What did you think you were doing?

203
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,248
- I was adding like, little sesame seeds.

204
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:46,502
- I thought that's what you were doing but I wasn't sure.

205
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:47,774
- I forgot that sesame seeds,

206
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:51,184
well, they have black sesame seeds, right?

207
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,866
Next up, I'm doing some lettuce.

208
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,586
Bro, my lettuce is starting to look more like a starfish.

209
00:05:55,586 --> 00:05:56,553
Bro, what are you doing?

210
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:57,640
Cheese is orange.

211
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,484
- Not my Swiss cheese.

212
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,375
(upbeat music)

213
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,314
- What the heck, is that face on your tomato?

214
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:05,647
- Just a tomato!

215
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:07,827
Pickle!

216
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:08,797
And then one little baby pickle.

217
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:10,433
Alright guys now the most important thing about a burger,

218
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,580
you know what you gotta do?

219
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,616
You gotta roast 'em.

220
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:14,229
Alright, well let me flip my first part here.

221
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,346
It looks like mold but it's actually chocolate chips.

222
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:18,179
- Wait, really?

223
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,381
- Yeah, I got a chocolate chip bun, patented.

224
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:20,462
There's my lettuce.

225
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:21,295
- What is that?

226
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:22,178
- It's a stem down the middle.

227
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:23,860
You know how lettuce has that stem down the middle?

228
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,778
- You know what, creative points!

229
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:27,520
- You got the base, you're gonna wanna

230
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,916
pop your let-tass on top.

231
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,501
You gotta put the burger here,

232
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,095
and then you got the cheese directly over the burger.

233
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:33,262
- That actually turned out pretty good.

234
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:34,476
- Yeah! Swiss cheese!

235
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:37,589
We got my tomato head, big pickle followed by lil pickle.

236
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:40,387
And then to top it all off, my burger bun.

237
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:42,199
Bro, we've made pancake food!

238
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,183
- Alright, it is time to put my ingredients on zee plate.

239
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:47,113
First, I put zee patty.

240
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:48,565
Next up, the cheese.

241
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:50,289
That's what I'm going with next.

242
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,464
Next up I am doing zee let-toss, tomatoes.

243
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,066
Ta-da!

244
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,565
- Oh my gosh bro I cannot wait to take a bite of this.

245
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:58,160
This is a pancake hamburger!

246
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,993

We are going to be making Christmas presents, go!

00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:04,092

250
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:04,925
- Yes, I did!

251
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:05,958
- Okay, I'm doing --

00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,874
- Boxes, boxes, man.

253
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,150
Gotta get my box right.

254
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,983
(fast forward talking)

255
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:11,708
(fast forward talking)

256
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,116
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, okay, I need this.

257
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:14,949
- Bro, you know what?

258
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:15,995
You know what I love on packages?

259
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:16,828

260
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:17,661

(fast forward talking)

263
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:24,053
Wait, I need a gray.

264
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:24,886
I'll use blue.

265
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:26,561
- Dude, we're running out of time,

266
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:27,624
we're running out of time, bro.

267
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:29,483
(fast forward talking)

268
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,523
- Final steps!

269
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:31,866
I'm taking a creative leap here.

270
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,493
Why is my thing not roasting?

271
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:37,213

272
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:40,894

00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,675

00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,391

277
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:50,405

278
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:53,364

279
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:56,131

00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:57,353
So guys you get to comment down below.

281
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,287

00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:00,371
I'm gonna open up my present.

00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:01,538
What's inside?

284
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:04,177
Alright, cool, next round, let's go.

285
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,002
For this round, we asked you guys on Snapchat

286
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:07,936
what pancake should we make?

287
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:09,057
We got a ton of responses,

288
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:10,854
and this is the one we're gonna do.

289
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:12,597
We're gonna take your suggestion to the next level

290
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:14,576
and combine the Santa and the reindeer

291
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:16,671
and do this all in 90 seconds.

292
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:17,729
Speed round, begin!

293
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,979
(fast forward talking)

294
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:23,327
Dude, I can't make art with this,

295
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:24,329
there's a little thing covering the top of it.

296
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,323
Oh, that's nice, okay.

297
00:08:25,323 --> 00:08:26,753
- You know what, I'm gonna actually

298
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:27,887
make Santa going down the chimney

299
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,316
instead of him going out of the chimney.

300
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:30,149
So, yeah!

301
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:31,487
(fast forward talking)

302
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,545
- Yo guys, alright so right now,

303
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,798
oh my gosh I just gotta fill in my chimney.

304
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:34,790
How much time do we have left?

305
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,343
- Geez, it's running out of time

306
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:37,176
- No, what?

307
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:38,699
(fast forward talking)

308
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:41,854
- His antlers, you know, going crazy like woo, yeah!

309
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,296
(fast forward talking)

310
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:45,761
- You got a little hat, because Santa always wears a hat.

311
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,407
- Ah, this is so quick!

312
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:48,760
- You'll never catch Santa slipping.

313
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,969
(fast forward talking)

314
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:54,260
Santa's been all tanned, he's been on vacation all year.

315
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,260
Three, oh no, two, one, done! - Done!

316
00:08:58,392 --> 00:08:59,312
- How do you think you did?

317
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:00,145
- I didn't even get my reindeer.

318
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:01,378
- My three things are ready to flip

319
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,427
because they are a lot smaller than yours.

320
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:04,260
- Yeah.

321
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,452
- Alright, we're going for Santa first.

322
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:06,679
- Three, two --

323
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,512
- Wait!

324
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:08,786
First, we have a three second like challenge

325
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:09,678
for you right now.

326
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,591
Can you like this video in three seconds?

327
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:12,424
Here we go.

328
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:15,232
- [Together] Three, two, one, done!

329
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:16,732
- Three, two, one.

330
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,647
- What was that?

331
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:20,872
- Alright, there you go, ta-da!

332
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:22,283
- That was the worst flip I've ever --

333
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:24,040
that wasn't even a flip that was just a fall.

334
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,847
It looks like a little elf that got stuck in a stocking.

335
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:28,567
- No it doesn't, no it doesn't, no.

336
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,400
Ta-da!

337
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,700
- Bro, from this angle it looks like some sort of lizard.

338
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,138
Like, two little legs, a head, it's like (grunts)

339
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:35,035
- It's a Christmas lizard!

340
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:36,295
Alright, three, two, one.

341
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:37,295
Failed flip.

342
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:40,650
Alright, three, two, one.

343
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,220
- You broke his leg!

344
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,419
- There we go, he's bow-legged!

345
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:45,801
- That's a bowlegged deer?

346
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:46,634
I've never seen that before.

347
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:47,672
He's like, garb garb.

348
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:48,677
- Alright, here we go!

349
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:51,690
- [Together] Three, two, one!

350
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,917
- Bro, it looks like Santa's on a griddle, or something.

351
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,706
- Comment down below who won this round?

352
00:09:57,706 --> 00:09:59,199
I really hope it's me.

353
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,322
For this final round, the one it all comes down to,

354
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:05,233
we're taking a photo that I recently posted on Instagram

355
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,148
with both of us in it, and we have to recreate this

356
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,530
as perfectly as possible.

357
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,363
Begin!

358
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:11,519
I'm gonna start off with Devan I think here.

359
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,708
(upbeat music)

360
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,838
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I have no clue what I'm doing here.

361
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:19,416
We look like two little alien dudes.

362
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,212
All I can say is whoever suggested this, you got us.

363
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:23,337
You got us good.

364
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:25,092
Alright, Devan's got some swooshy hair.

365
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,592
- I like that, swooshy hair.

366
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,263
- I messed up the swoosh!

367
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:29,551
I messed up real bad!

368
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:30,671
- But it's my swoosh?

369
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,504
- I know!

370
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:32,337
- How!

371
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:34,032
- I gave you a little bit too much volume with your swoosh.

372
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:35,547
My guys look like chicken.

373
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:36,847
- Look at my guy, dude.

374
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:37,865
He looks so funny.

375
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:39,029
- Why does he have a down-turned mouth?

376
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,098
I'm never not happy!

377
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,776
Alright, and you know what since this is our final round,

378
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:44,049
I'm just gonna go crazy and make a guh-normous pancake.

379
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,409
- A guh-normous?

380
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:46,242
- A guh-normous.

381
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:47,404
It's the final round!

382
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:49,889
(upbeat music)

383
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,114
I think my masterpiece is coming together.

384
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:52,078
- I have no face!

385
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:53,149
And look at those legs!

386
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:54,364
They're such twig legs!

387
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:55,206
- You got little twig legs.

388
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:56,701
- Like maybe I should should just go like this here

389
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:59,784
and then and then I have absolutely no neck.

390
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,278
- His head is in the middle of his chest.

391
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:02,167
- Yes!

392
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,000
(mumbles)

393
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,480
That's where my face is, right there.

394
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,392
- Oh my gosh.

395
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:06,668
- I gotta add eyes really quickly

396
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:08,667
- Dude, that's hilarious.

397
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,381
You look like a monster for sure.

398
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:11,316
- Yeah, dude.

399
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:12,579
Alright, it is time to add

400
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,859
some of this foliage just like this.

401
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:15,257
I'm going for the distant shots.

402
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,321
- What are you doing on this thing, bro?

403
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,849
It looks very abstract.

404
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,030
- Alright, so mine's getting pretty roasted here.

405
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,863
I'm almost done.

406
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:21,792
- Here's my hair.

407
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:22,625
- There we go!

408
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,458
- It's all done!

409
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,291
- I'm about to flip this and guys,

410
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,229
comment down below what are some other things that

411
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:28,627
we should turn into pancakes in an upcoming video?

412
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:31,627
But here's the flip, three, two, one

413
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:35,100
- Oh my gosh, I got it!

414
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,933
- Bro!

415
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:37,183
- Dude, you even got the leaves,

416
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:38,558
you got me, you got a little chicken dude.

417
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:39,914
But I think I nailed it!

418
00:11:39,914 --> 00:11:41,884
I don't know if we can say the same for yours though, Devan.

419
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,298
- I don't either, bro.

420
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:45,332
I'm actually really excited to see how this one turned out.

421
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:46,165
- Let's see how this goes.

422
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:46,998
- Alright, you ready?

423
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:47,831
- Uh huh.

424
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,128
- Three, two, one.

425
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:50,961
Oh!

426
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:54,142
- How did you do that flip?

427
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:56,458
- The fact that I made that flip, bro.

428
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,411
- Nothing broke!

429
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:59,755
- I should have the title just for that.

430
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:00,782
- No way, no way.

431
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:01,615
- Just for that!

432
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:03,609
- It's trash. You got a head in your chest.

433
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:05,283
That's how it happened in the photo,

434
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:06,810
- What's the problem with the head in my chest?

435
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,437
- Everything is the problem with a head in the chest.

436
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,455
Comment down below who won this round,

437
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:13,344
and who won the entire challenge.

438
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:15,327
And right now, it's time to taste test

439
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:17,994
all of these different pancakes.

440
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,173
- BB-8.

441
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,006
- What?

442
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:21,839
- BB-8.

443
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,672
- Bro, what are you saying?

444
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:23,505
What?

445
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:24,843
- BB-8, that's what they suggested!

446
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:27,331
BB-8 from the new Star Wars: The Last Jedi movie!

447
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,598
I know what this is!

448
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:29,476
- What?

449
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,977
- This isn't BB-8, this is (screeches)

450
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:33,052
(laughing)

451
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,416
It's my own version of the droid!

452
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,772
- It's a BB-8 pancake!

453
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:36,605
Bate!

454
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:37,588
- Bate!

455
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:40,715
- Oh, dude, why are you doing that?

456
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:42,798
- Time to eat my masterpiece

457
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:44,321
- And my masterpiece

458
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:45,899
- No, I wouldn't call that a masterpiece. You ready?

459
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:46,732
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

460
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,232
- Three, two, one.

461
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,175
- [Together] Woohoo!

462
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,008
- Oh no, I missed!

463
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:54,535
- Dude, why are these fantastic?

464
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:55,643
- Yeah, it really does.

465
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:56,939
- Next up, we got BB-8.

466
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:58,465
- Oh no, his head fell off!

467
00:12:58,465 --> 00:12:59,369
- It's bate! Bate!

468
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:01,053
- Bate! - Bate!

469
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,834
- Next up we got the present, I'm missing part of my present

470
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,344
- Whatever this blob is.

471
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:06,330
- This thing did not get cooked.

472
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,656
I don't wanna eat this, ew.

473
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:11,469
It's all just filled with disappointment again.

474
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:12,755
- Really? It's so good, mine is.

475
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:13,620
- It's disgusting.

476
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,607
- Next up is Santa, in a chimney.

477
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,015
- Hopefully we don't get in trouble

478
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:18,589
because I think we're being rather naughty by eating Santa,

479
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,874
but I still want presents this year.

480
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:21,957
- You know what, I won't eat Santa.

481
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:23,578
I'll take off his feet and just eat the chimney.

482
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:26,161
- I rolled him up into a crepe.

483
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:29,108
- Yo!

484
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:29,941
- That's a reindeer!

485
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,117
- Santa's delicious.

486
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:32,306
Hamburger cheers!

487
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:34,163
Alright let's try it, here we go.

488
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:36,496
- [Together] Three, two one.

489
00:13:37,802 --> 00:13:39,469
- Bro, bro. So good.

490
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:44,379
- I'm overwhelmed with how delicious that was.

491
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:45,584
And guys, right now, click right over here

492
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:47,766
And Devan, time to eat your final one.

493

Here we go!

494
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:51,571
You have five seconds right now, click right over here.

495
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:55,393
- [Together] Five, four, three, two, one.

496
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:56,620
- Done!

497
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,120
- [Together] Bye!
