1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:02,145
- Shizzle my nizzle!

2
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:02,978
- [Father] Done.

3
00:00:02,978 --> 00:00:03,908
(Collins laughs loudly)

4
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:05,137
- What's up, it's Collins Key

5
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:06,611
and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

6
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:07,577
And for today's video,

7
00:00:07,577 --> 00:00:08,846
as you can tell by the title,

8
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:10,024
I need a special guest to join me right now.

9
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:12,876
So everyone please welcome my little brother,

10
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:13,911
Devan Key.

11
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:14,744
(Collin yells)

12
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:15,577
(Devan laughs loudly)

13
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:16,410
- What's up?

14
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,526
(Collins laughs loudly)

15
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:20,417
What's up man? This is my friend.

16
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,151
(Collins laughs loudly)

17
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:22,984
- This is so stupid.

18
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:24,716
But yeah. Welcome to the Thursday vlog.

19
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:25,895
And now for today's video

20
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,053
Devan and I, we're going head to head.

21
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:28,751
We do a lot of challenges together,

22
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:30,383
but today we're taking it to the next...

23
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:31,460
(laughs)

24
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,552
Little hair right there is kind of terrifying me.

25
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:34,385
- Yup

26
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:36,398
- It's like a little spring coming off of his head.

27
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:37,557
So if you guys don't know,

28
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:39,519
Devan is literally my best friend in the entire world.

29
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:41,774
And this right here is my other best friend.

30
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:42,993
We're gonna be going head to head,

31
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:44,049
and we're doing this sibling test.

32
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,602
So our Dad has prepared a list of questions

33
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:47,469
that we should know about each other and--

34
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:48,302
- Dude!

35
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:49,930
- Basically, our Dad's gonna ask a question like,

36
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,059
"What color are Devin's eyes?"

37
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,409
- Something better than that hopefully but.

38
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:54,826
- It was off the top of the dome bro.

39
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:56,159
And then he's gonna write down what color he

40
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:56,992
thinks his eyes are.

41
00:00:56,992 --> 00:00:57,920
I'm gonna write down what color

42
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,005
I think his eyes are.

43
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:00,306
We're gonna turn around and reveal.

44
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:02,898
And if we get it right then nothing happens.

45
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:04,320
- It'll be a lot harder than that.

46
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,600
- Yeah. Trust me it will.

47
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,258
But, let's say I get it wrong

48
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:09,135
and I say that his eyes are red.

49
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:09,968
I don't know why I would say that.

50
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:13,676
Then, the other person gets to paint

51
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:14,509
- Is that--

52
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:15,375
- on the loser's face.

53
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,675
- All right. So that's how the challenge works.

54
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:18,147
And also I'm doing a huge giveaway

55
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:18,991

73
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:43,886
- He's been waiting for weeks to be like on

Instagram and Twitter.

75
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,446
You wanna let 'em know what your user name is?

76
00:01:47,446 --> 00:01:48,848
(laughing)

77
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:50,607
Don't worry. It'll be on the screen.

78
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:52,578
What's that? (laughs loudly)

79
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:55,329
And yo. Without any further ado.

80
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:56,162
What? (laughs loudly)

81
00:01:56,162 --> 00:01:56,995
Allright.

82
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:58,078
- I've been waiting for weeks?

83
00:01:58,078 --> 00:01:59,411
(Collins laughs loudly)

84
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,980
- I'm sorry.

85
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,935
- Really. Yeah, okay.

86
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,491
I've been waiting for weeks

87
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,226
trying to figure out what I'm gonna say.

88
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:08,797
(brothers laugh loudly)

89
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:09,811
We're gonna end the shenanigans

90
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:11,165
and get into more shenanigans

91
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,185
and let's get right into the video.

92
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:15,235
- But for real. My name is Devan Key.

93
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,958
(brothers laugh loudly)

94
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,641
- And it's DevanKey on Twitter.

95
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,495
- Go follow him. (laughs loudly)

96
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:25,094
- [Father] What is Devan's favorite emoji?

97
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:26,169
Draw it out.

98
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,665
- [Brothers] (laughs loudly) Oh!

99
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:29,462
- Okay. Well, I don't think I can draw this one.

100
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:32,548
We'll see. My art skills guys are not on fleek.

101
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:33,381
That's for sure.

102
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:34,214
Oh my gosh.

103
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:35,189
It looks like a... This is not a...

104
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,927
Oh god no! It doesn't look like...

105
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:37,760
How do I make this happier?

106
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,593
Three. Two. One.

107
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:39,482
Laughing emoji.

108
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:40,315
Did I get it?

109
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:41,148
- Yeah! With the tears.

110
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:41,981
With the tears. Yeah.

111
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,630
- Now look how bad mine looks.

112
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,764
(brothers laugh loudly)

113
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:48,602
- Whoo! We're safe for this round.

114
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,275
- [Father] Does Collins wear boxers or briefs?

115
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:54,219
- This is so easy. You don't know this?

116
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,724
- I'm not sure if I know the difference.

117
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:56,923
(Collins laughs loudly)

118
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:58,014
Three. Two. One.

119
00:02:58,014 --> 00:02:59,138
Briefs!

120
00:02:59,138 --> 00:02:59,971
Did you get it right? - Yep

121
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,209
- Yep! I'm all about them brief lifes.

122
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,167
- Yeah.

123
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,000
- I don't like boxers man.

124
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,227
- I don't either. It's too much air flowing.

125
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:05,336
- It's like wearing a cloud.

126
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:07,577
It's like wearing a cloud.

127
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:08,616
- And you'd think that would be a good thing.

128
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:09,449
But it's not.

129
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:10,282
- It's not. No.

130
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:11,216
No but it's like.

131
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:12,508
It's like a cloud with too much excess.

132
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,768
That's the only way to describe it. Yeah.

133
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:15,739
- It's just-- - It's not streamlined.

134
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:17,205
- No. - All right.

135
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:18,238
Let's move on to the next question.

136
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:19,071
- Yes. Please.

137
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:23,154
- [Father] What is Devan's most irritating habit?

138
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:25,990
- What?

139
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,823
- Oh! I know this one.

140
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:27,828
Three. Two. One.

141
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:29,319
- Always having to be right.

142
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,083
- Yeah. Being right. - Yes!

143
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,049
(brothers laugh loudly)

144
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,583
- Which I have to say is not--

145
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,555
- Dude you've gotten a lot better though.

146
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:37,621
- No. I always admit when I'm wrong and--

147
00:03:37,621 --> 00:03:39,621
- Always is a very strong word.

148
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:41,097
- Oh yeah. When I am wrong.

149
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,404
- [Father] I just wanna make a point here.

150
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:45,782
Devan has argued this whole point for him

151
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:46,615
to be right.

152
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:47,844
(Collins laughs loudly)

153
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:49,128
- And Collins does the same thing.

154
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,633
- He's still arguing about being right.

155
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,531
- Because it's kinda true.

156
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:56,107
- [Father] If Collins were deserted on an island,

157
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:57,550
what are the three things

158
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,976
he could not live without?

159
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:01,447
- [Brothers] Three. Two. One.

160
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:04,635
- I said Devan, the internet,

161
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:05,905
and the ability to teleport.

162
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:06,738
- What?

163
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:07,571
(loudly buzzing)

164
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:08,404
- Yeah. What did you say?

165
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:09,781
- I did actual things that exist.

166
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:10,777
- You exist.

167
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:12,288
- The ability to teleport?

168
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:13,264
- Yeah. It's out there.

169
00:04:13,264 --> 00:04:14,718
Bro, I'm sure someone's working on it.

170
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:15,815
Devan takes the first L.

171
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:17,103
So now it's time to put some

172
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:18,059
face paint on you Bro.

173
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,156
- All right. (mumbles)

174
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:20,326
- We're gonna go with green.

175
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,159
- Oh gosh.

176
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,626
(trippy music)

177
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:25,659
Yeah! I've always wanted a mustache.

178
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,990
- You got a mustache. - Yeah!

179
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,653
- [Father] What food does Devan enjoy the most?

180
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:30,486
- Oh, I don't know.

181
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:31,902
Oh, I think I know.

182
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:32,735
- [Brothers] Three. Two. One.

183
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:33,568
- Sushi!

184
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,401
- [Brothers] Ice cream! - Dangit!

185
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:35,234
(loud buzzing)

186
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,067
- Ha! Yes!

187
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:36,900
(Collins screams)

188
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,670
- That was so loud.

189
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,419
You really shouted in my ear.

190
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:42,562
- I'm sorry bro.

191
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:43,712
- I can't believe I got that wrong.

192
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:45,520
- Yeah! And it's like the worst smiley face ever.

193
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,581
But still I won so yeah.

194
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:48,750
- It has a tongue like (gurgling)

195
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,680
- All right. - I'm a little bit nervous.

196
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,513
- Aw yes.

197
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:54,538
- All right.

198
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:56,017
Three. Two. One.

199
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:58,600
(Devan laughs)

200
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:01,085
- I don't even know what it looks like.

201
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:02,176
I think it's a heart.

202
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,536
You drew like a heart on my lips.

203
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,369
- Sort of a heart.

204
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:06,490
But it's like those Victorian-like--

205
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,792
- Oh gosh!

206
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,307
- [Father] Next question.

207
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:10,140
- Yeah. Let's hit it.

208
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,873
- [Father] Who would Collins say is more messy?

209
00:05:12,873 --> 00:05:14,774
- Oh. This is easy.

210
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:15,920
- Me! - Collins!

211
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,739
And it takes to major L's!

212
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:21,319
(brothers laugh loudly)

213
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,461
- It's so stupid. Okay, there we go.

214
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:24,692
- So true.

215
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,525
- Yeah. You're right.

216
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,358
All right. I'm a little bit more messy.

217
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:27,191
Not much.

218
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,024
- No.

219
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:28,857
- Not much but just enough.

220
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:31,425
- [Father] What is Devan's astrological sign?

221
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:32,725
- [Brothers] Three. Two. One.

222
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:33,558
Aries!

223
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,036
- Yeah.

224
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,517
- Can Collins whistle?

225
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:39,476
- That's it? - That's it?

226
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:40,684
- [Father] If yes, prove it.

227
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:42,348
- Three. Two. One. - Uno. Dos. Tres.

228
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:44,806
- [Brothers] Yeah! (laughs)

229
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:45,669
- And then now I have to prove it.

230
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:46,706
Which I don't know if I can do with this

231
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:47,984
lipstick stuff on.

232
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:49,144
Because normally I would lick my lips

233
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:50,464
but I don't wanna get this stuff on my tongue.

234
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:51,297
- Do it.

235
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:52,231
(Collins whistles)

236
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:53,664
- [Father] What is Devan's favorite holiday?

237
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:54,700
- [Brothers] Three. Two. One.

238
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,685
Christmas!

239
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:57,080
- Wait dude! Did we both do it with an X?

240
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,956
(brothers laugh loudly)

241
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:00,595
No way!

242
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:01,512
Dude! Dude!

243
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,656
Yo! If that's not twinning on another level.

244
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:08,080
That's pretty crazy right there.

245
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,261
- [Father] What would Devan say

246
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,481
is his greatest talent?

247
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,981
- Oh. That's hard.

248
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:15,556
- Being right.

249
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:17,060
(brothers laugh loudly)

250
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,168
- [Brothers] Three. Two. One.

251
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:19,611
- Styling his hair.

252
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:20,444
(loud buzzing)

253
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:22,780
(brothers laugh loudly)

254
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,393
I was gonna say art but you do

255
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:25,552
so many other things.

256
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,661
You can act-- - That's what I meant.

257
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,083
- And you produce music.

258
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,465
- Because an artist is considered someone who is

259
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:32,020
so an actor, a painter, a musician.

260
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,937
- Oh. Okay.

261
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:33,770
- They're all artists.

262
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,603
- Gotcha.

263
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,382
No! I was gonna do this to you.

264
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:39,215
No!

265
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,480
(trippy music)

266
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,670
(Devan laughs)

267
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,036
I'm not happy with this challenge right now.

268
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,754
(Devan laughs loudly)

269
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:47,790
This is not good.

270
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,754
- It looks perfect bro.

271
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:50,147
- It's art. - It's all good.

272
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:50,980
- It's totally art.

273
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,121
- [Father] What is Devan's favorite

274
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:52,974
kind of puzzle?

275
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:54,631
- All right. Three. Two. One.

276
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,039
- Girls! - Mental--

277
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,047
(loud buzzing)

278
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:57,880
- What is yours?

279
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,713
- Like, mental or brain puzzles.

280
00:06:58,713 --> 00:06:59,546
(Collins laughs loudly)`

281
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:00,379
- All right.

282
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,897
So Devan gets to write on my face again

283
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:02,730
because I got it wrong.

284
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,563
Wee!

285
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:04,416
Oh man. Oh man.

286
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,249
Not again.

287
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,707
(trippy music)

288
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:08,723
All right. Next question.

289
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:09,556
Let's get to it. - All right.

290
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,780
- [Father] What song best describes Collins?

291
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,304
- Three. Two. One. - All right.

292
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:15,498
- A thousand miles. - Crazy--

293
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:17,022
- (laughs) Crazy frog. (laughs loudly)

294
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:17,943
(loud buzzing)

295
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,846
- A thousand miles?

296
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,815
- Da na na na na na na

297
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:22,648
And I need you

298
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:23,805
- [Brothers] Da na na na na na na

299
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:24,961
And I miss you

300
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:25,794
- Da

301
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:26,670
Yeah. No I was just joking.

302
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,234
But like crazy frogs is like actually--

303
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:29,291
- Crazy frog.

304
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,348
- But you didn't get it right.

305
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:31,294
It's a bummer. All right.

306
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:32,127
Here we go.

307
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:32,960
And you're gonna have to close your eyes

308
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,793
for this one.

309
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:34,626
- No. - Yes.

310
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,292
- Oh! - Yes. Close your eyes.

311
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:37,125
- Dude, this is gonna be awesome!

312
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,085
- Close your eyes! (laughs)

313
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:41,054
(trippy music)

314
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:41,887
- Darn it!

315
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:43,177
I literally thought you were doing the eyeS

316
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:45,149
on the eyelid.

317
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,590
So every time I would blink it looks as though--

318
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,423
- Oh no!

319
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:48,256
- So I was like "This is is gonna be so awesome!"

320
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:49,364
Like Pirates of the Caribbean!

321
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:50,197
- Nope!

322
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:51,142
And then now you look like...

323
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:52,139
Yeah, you look kinda crazy.

324
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,239
- Yeah. Well.

325
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,222
Yeah. Okay.

326
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:55,143
(brothers laugh loudly)

327
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:55,976
- [Father] Next question!

328
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:56,809
- Yes . - All right.

329
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,642
- [Father] What celebrity does

330
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:58,875
Collins most resemble?

331
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,131
- [Brothers] What?

332
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:01,964
- [Brothers] Three. Two. One.

333
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,438
- Queen Elizabeth!

334
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:04,533
(buzzing loudly)

335
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:05,366
(Collins laughs)

336
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:06,729
- I said a random guy from Tron.

337
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:07,827
Like the main guy in Tron.

338
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:09,533
I mean like two people in my entire life

339
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:10,366
have been like,

340
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,738
you kinda look like the main guy from Tron.

341
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:13,721
- All right. Devan got this one wrong so...

342
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:14,960
Yep. Let's do this.

343
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,935
I'm warning you guys.

344
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:18,922
This one is gonna be very, very mature.

345
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:19,755
Turn towards me.

346
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:20,755
There we go.

347
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:25,365
(Collins laughs loudly)

348
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:28,737
- Did you just write poop on my forehead?

349
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:29,773
Did you?

350
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:30,695
- I don't know.

351
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:31,683
- Oh my gosh.

352
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:32,516
(Collins laughs loudly)

353
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:33,871
- [Father] If Devan had a super power

354
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:37,908
would he be invisible or be able to fly?

355
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:38,741
- [Brothers] Three. Two. One.

356
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:40,199
- Fly! - Neither!

357
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:41,358
Cuz he's a basic bro.

358
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:43,249
(buzzing loudly) (brothers laugh loudly)

359
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:45,087
- Let's see who basic after this face painting?

360
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:46,448
(Collins laughs loudly)

361
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:47,281
(trippy music)

362
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,048
- It's hard to tell what you're writing.

363
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:52,359
(trippy music)

364
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,645
Can't figure it out.

365
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:55,866
- (laughs loudly) Who's basic now bro?

366
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,227
(brothers laugh loudly)

367
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:58,367
- All right. Next question.

368
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,200
Let's go.

369
