1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,547
- Yo, it works, eh the sourest

2
00:00:02,547 --> 00:00:04,490
fidget spinner in the entire world.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,059
(yells)

4
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:09,608
You guys challenged me to make edible candy fidget spinner.

5
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:10,855
I have a whole bunch of candy here

6
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:12,185
and at the end of this I'm gonna be making

7
00:00:12,185 --> 00:00:15,012
the first ever world's sourest fidget spinner

8
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:16,985
and I'm really nervous 'cause two things are gonna happen.

9
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:18,180
I'm probably gonna knock out a tooth

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,482
trying to bite into it and also,

11
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:23,332
it's gonna be so sour, like this, I've got malic acid, guys,

12
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:24,391
you know what's gonna be goin' down.

13
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,587
And I have no idea why you think

14
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:26,755
I'm gonna be good at playing with fidget spinners,

15
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,053
but I mean hey, let's give it a try.

16
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:29,482
Three, two, one, go.

17
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:31,899
(rock music)

18
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:44,877
Now it's time to get rid of the card,.

19
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:46,127
And now the part you've all been waiting for,

20
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:47,960
yes, I will be spinning this every single time

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,630
I begin a new section and right now

22
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,516
we are gonna be deconstructing the fidget spinner,

23
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:53,591
so RIP buddy, I've had a great time with you

24
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:55,886
but we just pop this off here.

25
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:57,402
Don't they look like balls inside of there,

26
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:58,442
what's up with that.

27
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:00,180
Umm, how does this work, do you?

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,430
(clatters)

29
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:04,386
I think I broke it.

30
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:06,593
Let's see if it works without the covers on it.

31
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:08,243
Hey, it actually, well wait wait wait.

32
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:09,357
Do these actually do anything here,

33
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:10,452
these little ball things on the end,

34
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:12,257
I'm gonna pop these out, just kinda curious, let's see.

35
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:14,872
(spins)

36
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:15,962
I think it has no weight so it probably

37
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:17,725
stops a lot sooner, yeah.

38
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:18,558
So, oww.

39
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,355
(blows)

40
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:22,542
I sound like a plane when I'm doing this.

41
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:24,244
(laughs)

42
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:25,562
This next part is gonna be one

43
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:26,681
(clanks)

44
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:27,877
Most scientific things I've ever,

45
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:30,877
that's like a bottle flip challenge.

46
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm breaking so much stuff.

47
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,878
(beeps)

48
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:34,877
And shout out to Stephen Cheer

49
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:35,888
because I would've had no idea

50
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:36,961
how to make these molds, make sure you guys

51
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,241
go check out his video, the link is gonna be

52
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:39,367
down in the description below.

53
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:41,486
But basically you take these two different colored putties,

54
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:42,939
mix 'em together, and then you have one minute

55
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,392
to put it down and then put the fidget spinner on it,

56
00:01:46,392 --> 00:01:48,972
make a mold of it, and then you can turn it into candy.

57
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:50,273
That's what's gonna happen, it's gonna be magnificent,

58
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:52,441
and I'm gonna try not to mess this up.

59
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:53,470
All right we're taking this (mumbles)

60
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,000
boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop, mmm, mmm.

61
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,909
You gotta get this out super quick

62
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,102
because otherwise this stuff is gonna

63
00:01:58,102 --> 00:01:59,371
go away and it's gonna get hardened

64
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:00,622
and it gets very very very hard.

65
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:01,622
Okay here we go woop, bam, boop.

66
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,623
Yep, mix it all together, yooey!

67
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,624
That's like makin' edible slime again.

68
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,374
(coughs)

69
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:06,539
I'm not sed to workin' with a time constraint on

70
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,003
these sort of things, just kinda get to mess around.

71
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,190
But now I literally have 60 seconds

72
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,813
to mix this all together, otherwise it's gonna harden

73
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,439
and then the whole thing will be ruined.

74
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,261
Gonna go baker mode on it, oh yeah, la la la la.

75
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,344
Grrr. Oh boy.

76
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:19,288
It's actually to getting a lot harder

77
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:20,479
to mold and squeeze now so I think it's startin'

78
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,875
to harden now, so now we're gonna place on the plate.

79
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,608
Gonna remove, oh no there's stuff on the plate.

80
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:27,146
So we're gonna roll it now into a ball.

81
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,550
Perfect, here we go, we're gonna take a place down here,

82
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,141
just kinda flatten it out.

83
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:32,929
(clangs), great!

84
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:34,280
Now we're gonna take the fidget spinner,

85
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,360
oh we gotta pop this out, yay.

86
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,617
All right here we go, gotta push the fidget spinner in here.

87
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,443
(whimsical orchestral music)

88
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:41,446
All right, and then I think you kinda

89
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:43,264
wanna mold the edges close to it,

90
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,061
that way you kinda get a nice like fidget spinnery look.

91
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:47,474
So it's been 25 minutes and this thing now is really solid.

92
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:48,511
It looks really squishy but you guys

93
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,095
can put this in the microwave, it won't melt

94
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:51,755
and only the candy will melt.

95
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,867
So we're gonna pop out the fidget spinner now.

96
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,854
Yay, that's the mold right there.

97
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:56,852
(children cheering)

98
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:58,258
To kick it off we're gonna be tasting the rainbow,

99
00:02:58,258 --> 00:02:59,532
with some skittles right here.

100
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,281
So I think what we do is we take the skittles.

101
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,622
I'm gonna get roasted so hard in the comments

102
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:04,901
for how I just opened this bag of skittles.

103
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,154
Like that's not the way you open it.

104
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:07,513
All right gonna kinda put 'em in there.

105
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:09,768
Now time to pop this into the microwave

106
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:11,509
and create a beautiful fidget mold,

107
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:14,662
once I rearrange it all, so let's do that.

108
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,448
- [Man] A few moments later.

109
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:17,455
- These skittles did not work out,

110
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:19,219
there's actually more like an egg that cracked,

111
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,828
but you can very easily crack this, watch.

112
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:22,185
This did not work, there is no way

113
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:24,167
that I could fidget spin one of this.

114
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,640
Just not gonna work.

115
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,116
- [Man] Time for a cool fidget spinner trick.

116
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:30,014
- Spin, flip, catch, drop, another spin, hooh!

117
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:33,264
Flip, catch, drop, flip, catch, caught.

118
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:38,102
(beeps)

119
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,620
Now this fidget spinner, even though I don't like it a ton

120
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,505
actually has these things which keep it in place.

121
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,420
So I made a mold of it, you know the feeling you get

122
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,577
when something is gonna work?

123
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:46,300
Well that's the feeling I have right now.

124
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,530
Jolly ranchers.

125
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,897
(clatters)

126
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:50,902
Let's go.

127
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:52,460
You guys, I told you this was gonna work.

128
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,941
I think this is it, here we go three, two, one.

129
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:59,230
Yes, this looks so good.

130
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,786
Okay now, the moment of truth.

131
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:03,145
We have put now the fidgety spinner wheel,

132
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:04,657
whatever the heck it is that makes this thing work

133
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:06,419
and then we're gonna see if we can spin it.

134
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,537
Ooh, I'm nervous but very excited.

135
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:09,647
The moment of truth.

136
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:12,720
Will it spin, three, two, one.

137
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,275
Yo, it works!

138
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:16,404
Guys, we did it, it finally worked.

139
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:17,956
Oh my gosh I'm so hyped.

140
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:20,721
This is like so, so, so, cool.

141
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:21,940
And now it's time for the first ever

142
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,023
fidget spinner lick test, here we go.

143
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:29,322
Yep, this tastes delicious.

144
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:33,275
- [Man] Time for a cool fidget spinner trick, again.

145
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:35,304
- This just seems like a bad idea.

146
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:36,792
(splats)

147
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:37,793
Ow.

148
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:38,792
Yeah that actually could get hurt.

149
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,001
That that this is that that really hurt.

150
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:43,265
And we're gonna start off right here with one fidget spinner

151
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:44,518
and then we're gonna get another

152
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,207
fidget spinner going on top of it.

153
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,529
And let's see if we can get one more goin'

154
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,353
on top of this, there's no way.

155
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:50,354
Yeah! (cheering)

156
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:52,214
Between the bean boozled challenge or starburst

157
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:53,798
I think more of you guys suggested starburst would work

158
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:56,772
and then the bean boozle challenge would probably fail.

159
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,443
I am not on my a game when it comes

160
00:04:58,443 --> 00:04:59,929
to throwing things and catching things today.

161
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:01,624
And that wasn't even a throw, that was a drop.

162
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:05,374
But um, let's go, yeah, I'm joking, yay, yay.

163
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:07,886
Whee!

164
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:08,886
All right we're gonna crack open,

165
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:11,636
gonna crack open some Starbursts.

166
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:15,550
- [Man] One eternity later.

167
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,608
Oh that was so difficult.

168
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,508
All right we're just gonna, perfect.

169
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:22,009
But now I have to color code it,

170
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,930
unwrap all of these, which can get kind of boring.

171
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,932
So we'll just fast forward until

172
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:26,485
the part where I have it all made, yeah.

173
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:29,235
All right let's see if it worked.

174
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:32,785
Oh dude, this worked out so well!

175
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:33,960
Oh my gosh.

176
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,922
Now the true test to see if it can truly fidget spin.

177
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,302
But first I have a challenge, I wanna see if

178
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:39,634

183

keyper squad right now.

184
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,155
Let's see if we can pop it in here.

185
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,905
(dramatic music)

186
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:02,574
(groans and sobs)

187
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:07,260
Fail, we were so close, what happened.

188
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,706
I'm so upset right now.

189
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:09,801
It's all about movin' on though,

190
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,997
gotta stay positive and let's make

191
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:13,614
this next one the best one.

192
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:18,072
- [Man] Time for a cool fidget spinner trick, again again.

193
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:19,107
Two fidgets at once.

194
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:22,664
I see these people with finger strength

195
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:23,976
they're like (yells) and it's like

196
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:25,058
it spins like crazy.

197
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:27,303
I can't do the thousand mile per hour finger spin.

198
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,758
I need the two hand, yaiy.

199
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:31,339
We're gonna try with the bean boozled challenge.

200
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,758
And first I'm going to try some beans

201
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:35,479
and just see how this goes.

202
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,875
(rattles)

203
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,653
(chomps)

204
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:41,867
(yells)

205
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:45,066
Horrible, I got all the worst ones.

206
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,248
Help me, okay.

207
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:47,433
Well that was terrible.

208
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:50,224
So now we're gonna add these in here.

209
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,618
I can smell these ones are all bad

210
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,545
and now we're gonna add these in,

211
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,609
microwave 'em and let's see if this fidget spinner works.

212
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:57,998
I gotta mention, out of all of em so far.

213
00:06:57,998 --> 00:06:59,790
This one I gotta say is not the prettiest,

214
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,023
but I mean it kinda works and this thing smelled

215
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:03,883
so bad when I was microwaving it.

216
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:05,947
It was horrible so if you do this at home, be warned.

217
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,288
It's gonna smell terrible.

218
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:09,227
So now we have part of of the fidget spinner

219
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:11,020
which we insert over here.

220
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,787
Here we go and then we have part two of the fidget spinner

221
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:14,599
here and they do not appear to be

222
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,062
compatible with this mold it all.

223
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,710
Let me see if I can get this though, oh my gosh.

224
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,105
Here it is, the moment of truth.

225
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:21,772
See if it will spin.

226
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,887
I mean this is not as satisfying as I wanted it to be.

227
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,617
I wanted the (low pitched moan)

228
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,978
But there's definitely room for improvement,

229
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:34,172
and luckily we're not done yet

230
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:36,656
because we still have the most sour one in the entire world.

231
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,304
With that one, I have so much faith that it's gonna work.

232
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:40,726
But first, we'll take a bite of this one,

233
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,810
just kind of try it out.

234
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,643
Ah.

235
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:46,942
Yeah, nope.

236
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:48,784
- [Man] Time for a cool fidget spinner

237
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:51,034
trick, again, again, again.

238
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:53,609
- Ow.

239
00:07:55,763 --> 00:07:56,846
It's so hard.

240
00:07:57,908 --> 00:07:59,239
Ow, my lip.

241
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,906
We're about to make the sourest fidget spinner in the world

242
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,454
but first I wanna give a huge shout out

243
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:03,821
to the keyper of the week, Ash.

244
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,177
If you wanna be the keyper of the week,

245
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:06,184
check the description at down below

246
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:07,560
and right now it's time to eat

247
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,947
the sourest fidget spinner in the entire world.

248
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:13,585
I brought the one and only Warheads so here we go.

249
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:16,058
(tape scratching noise)

250
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:19,848
Let's open these up and then we'll microwave 'em.

251
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:21,408
I'm not lookin' forward to this.

252
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:23,337
Yo this one actually turned out so cool.

253
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,166
The other ones were all a solid color but this one

254
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,570
looks tie-dyed, there a ton of little holes on it.

255
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,612
And this one looks sweet, kinda innocent, but it's not.

256
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,353
This is gonna be intense, and what we're gonna do right now

257
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:35,976
we're gonna pop this in, it's so close to breaking.

258
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:37,722
I have to hold it upside down, otherwise

259
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:38,895
there's no way it's gonna work,

260
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:40,659
it's so close to breaking, how do I do this.

261
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,236
One finger balance, if this doesn't work, nothing will.

262
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,439
Three, two, one.

263
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:47,279
Hey, the sourest fidget spinner in the entire world.

264
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,042
I'm gonna take a bite of it, three two one.

265
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,067
(gasps)

266
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,067
Oh my gosh it's so sour.

267
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:55,755
(beeps)

268
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:56,825
In the extreme sourness I forgot to add the malic acid

269
00:08:56,825 --> 00:08:58,324
so for those of you guys who are like

270
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:02,238
where's the malic acid, there's the malic acid.

271
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:03,071
Oh.

272
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:07,570
(beeps)

273
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,715
- [Man] Time for a cool fidget spinner trick.

274
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,048
I'm sorry, again, seriously?

275
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,014
- Hooh.

276
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:17,372
(crashes)

277
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:18,377
The one trick I really do wanna get

278
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:20,181
where you toss it up and then you

279
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,056
catch it in the other and then you go back,

280
00:09:22,056 --> 00:09:25,439
oh and then you, that's part of the trick, I promise.

281
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,013
And then we'll try one last time here, ugh.

282
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:29,763
Egh, ooh and then back again, oh.

283
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:34,391
(clatters)

284
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:36,891
(rock music)
