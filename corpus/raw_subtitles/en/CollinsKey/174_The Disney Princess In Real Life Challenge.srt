00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:05,681

00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:07,326
but join me and meet my little brother,

4
00:00:07,326 --> 00:00:09,084
or should I say, Elsa.

5
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:10,806
Hey, there we go.

6
00:00:10,806 --> 00:00:11,639

7
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:12,820

8
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,572
the Disney Princess Challenge.

9
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:16,739
Basically, there are five different Disney princesses

10
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:19,434
that we have created unique, original challenges for.

11
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:20,267
We're going to be going through these

12
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:23,052
and whoever wins the most amount of these challenges,

13
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:25,781
they get to have the loser go run through

14
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:26,614
a public shopping place--

15
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:27,447
- What?

16
00:00:27,447 --> 00:00:28,632
- In one of these costumes.

17
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:29,465
- No!

18
00:00:29,465 --> 00:00:31,541

43
00:01:09,393 --> 00:01:10,436
- In my Snapchat before, I was doing like

44
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:11,269
pull-ups in this dress,

45
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:12,792
doing like some Olympic gymnastics routines.

46
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:14,047
Make sure you guys add us on Snapchat

47
00:01:14,047 --> 00:01:15,849
so you don't miss any of the fun shenanigans

48
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:16,682
that is always going on--

49
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:18,032
- It's just a bunch of behind-the-scenes footage,

50
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:18,865
so go check it out.

51
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:20,533
- Right now, without any further ado, let's get in,

52
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:23,719
and this is round #1 of the Disney princess challenge.

53
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,979
Dab dab, lets do this.

54
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,295
(yelling)

55
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,134
For round #1, it is battle of the Belles,

56
00:01:28,134 --> 00:01:29,462
and for this challenge we have to carry

57
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:31,578
three books on our head and balance them

58
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:33,861
and go to that wall over there without dropping them.

59
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,345
Now if you drop your books, it's automatic disqualification.

60
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:37,260
- I'm good.

61
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,093
I'm good--

62
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:38,926
- Which will not be good.

63
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:39,759
I didn't mean that, that hit you.

64
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,609
- Bro, I had that.

65
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,102
- My hair looks like a soccer mom by the way, guys.

66
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,060
Alright, cool.

67
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,262
Just lost my hair.

68
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:46,750
Me and my hair (???).

69
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,661
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

70
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:49,411
- No no no wait, it's tickling my armpit.

71
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:50,842
- That doesn't count, it doesn't count.

72
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:52,467
Alright I got it, oh that doesn't count,

73
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:53,353
that doesn't count, I got this.

74
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:54,186
- This isn't fair, bro.

75
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:55,896
- I got this, I got it, it doesn't count.

76
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:56,729
There we go.

77
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,342
- No!

78
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:01,730
- This is great, you know, I'm not holding it at all.

79
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,730
See, I'm not holding it.

80
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,448
- I got automatic disqualification.

81
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:08,416
That didn't go according to plan.

82
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,475
- Make sure you read your books, kids.

83
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:11,531
- Joking, alright.

84
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,744
Well I lost my hair, I lost my books,

85
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:14,339
and from what Devan said, I didn't see him at all,

86
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:16,181
but he says he didn't cheat so he won fair and square.

87
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:18,561
- I didn't cheat at all, we're good.

88
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:20,144
- I lose round one.

89
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,612
Alright round two, let's get it.

90
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:23,445
- Let's do it.

91
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:24,848
- This is the Little Mermaid challenge.

92
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:25,818
As you guys know, the Little Mermaid loves

93
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:27,134
collecting human items.

94
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:28,635
For this, we are going to be using forks.

95
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:29,864
Devan, do you have a fork?

96
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:31,364
- This is my fork.

97
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,293
- This is my fork.

98
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,126
I don't think this is quite fair,

99
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:36,021
because you have a much bigger fork than I do.

100
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:36,854
- I think this is great.

101
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:38,536
- For this, we're gonna do rock, paper, scissors

102
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:39,780
to see who gets the bigger fork.

103
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,975
Put your fork down.

104
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:42,804
Ready, rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

105
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,498
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

106
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,016
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

107
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,272
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

108
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:48,630
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

109
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,622
I win!

110
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:50,810
I get the big fork.

111
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,776
Three, two, one, go.

112
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:53,859
That's my fork!

113
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:57,880
Okay, whoever gets all his rope on their fork first wins.

114
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,578
I win, I win, I win.

115
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:00,411
Good game.

116
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:01,244
- I won!

117
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:03,587
- No no no no no no no fam, I won that round.

118
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,004
- I won this one.

119
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:12,582
- After watching the instant replay,

120
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:15,178
it does appear as though Devan did get his fork in the air

121
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:16,560
before I did, so Devan did--

122
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,393
- I did?

123
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:18,226
- Yeah, so you take the win this one.

124
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:19,406
- Yeah!

125
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:20,239
- Yay!

126
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:24,070
I just messed up our yard, bro.

127
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,182
This is the Snow White challenge.

128
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:26,932
For this, we have a whole bunch of poison apples

129
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,025
and it's whoever can eat the most poison apples

130
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:31,890
in 30 seconds, I know it kinda goes against the whole story

131
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,727
but whatever.

132
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:35,144
Alright, three, two, one, go.

133
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,044
- Oh no.

134
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:43,094
I'm sorry.

135
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:45,289
What?

136
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:06,724
(timer ringing)

137
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:10,830
- Don't know how I fit one and quarter apples

138
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,548
in my mouth but

139
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:14,863
I win so we Gucci.

140
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,649
Don't you hate it when your headphones get tangled?

141
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,097
This that relatable moments here.

142
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:22,180
Whoever can untangle their headphones first,

143
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,130
they win this challenge, so go.

144
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,963
- Okay.

145
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:25,972
- Alright well I'm going for this kind of like

146
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:27,706
grab everything technique.

147
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:31,347
- I don't have a technique so I'm just going.

148
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:33,513
- Getting so close, getting so close, yeah.

149
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:35,543
Now just the two little headphones, what are you doing fam?

150
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:36,376
Get it together.

151
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,878
Bro, I'm like a tangle person right now.

152
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,716
- Mine got more tangled.

153
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:41,029
- Yes there we go, one is free.

154
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:44,079
One is free, there we go, mine are like, rubbery.

155
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,924
Oh no, you're getting so close, no no no no no.

156
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:46,757
- I'm getting closer.

157
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:47,745
- Does blowing on it help?

158
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,775
Okay come on, I'm so close.

159
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,232
Look at this, there's like a knot at the end.

160
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:52,192
- I'm so close.

161
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,603
- Yes!

162
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:55,009
Alright cool, now I can finally listen to

163
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:57,724
all my Disney tracks in peace.

164
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,049
- I can listen too, actually.

165
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,374
♫ Let it go let it go ♫

166
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:02,291
- I'm done.

167
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,319
- That didn't work.

168
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,344
Alright cool, next round let's go.

169
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:11,378
Round #5, the tie-breaker round.

170
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,386
This is the Else frozen challenge.

171
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:15,326
We have some Slurpees right here in some Frozen cups

172
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:17,185
and whoever can drink the full Slurpee first,

00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:18,869

00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:19,855
so light up your cup.

175
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:21,357
- Is that possible?

176
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:22,190
I got it.

177
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,459
- Wait wait, I can't gett.

178
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:24,292
- Did you get it?

179
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,125
- Think I broke it.

180
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,094
Well I broke mine so I guess cheers.

181
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:26,927
- Cheers.

182
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,010
- Here we go.

183
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:34,211
Ow, I have such a bad brain freeze.

184
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:39,373
- I can't do it, I'm only halfway through.

185
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,296
- And there you have it.

186
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,123
Alright guys, that is the Disney princess challenge.

187
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:46,113
We are about to now have Devan run through the grove

188
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,758
dressed up as Disney princess.

189
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:49,455
- I forgot I had to do that!

190
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:50,288
No!

191
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:51,519
- Should have drank it a little bit faster, bro.

192
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,904

I think we're gonna go out to the Grove and Devan--

200
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,824
- I'm not happy about this.

201
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,376
- Let's do it.

202
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,183
♫ Let it go

203
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:14,097
♫ Can't hold it back anymore ♫

204
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:16,347
(laughing)

205
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:32,971
