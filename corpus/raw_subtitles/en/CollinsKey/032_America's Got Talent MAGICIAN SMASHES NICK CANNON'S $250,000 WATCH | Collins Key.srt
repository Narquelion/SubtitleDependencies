1
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:01,614
- The last time, I kind of like,

2
00:00:01,614 --> 00:00:03,082
I tried to use magic to get a girlfriend.

3
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:05,798
- They said central park.

4
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,011
- Central park.

5
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:08,474
- Oh my God.

6
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:09,902
- Thank you so much.

7
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:11,080
- [Collins] I think something went a little

8
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,415
bit amiss in the magic last time,

9
00:00:12,415 --> 00:00:13,529
because I guess she had a boyfriend.

10
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:14,980
And so I'm still single, I don't

11
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,447
have a girlfriend anymore so, I never had one.

12
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:18,805
(laughs)

13
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:21,063
- So the Collins that's on stage

14
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,065
is the Collins that's at home with us.

15
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,748
And so when people meet him on the street.

16
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:26,397
- Can we have the picture?

17
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:27,581
- Yeah, let's do it, yeah, yeah!

18
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:28,875
- It's the same kid, they're not

19
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,164
getting something different.

20
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:31,330
- [Collins] I almost gave up magic,

21
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,532
just 'cause like peer pressure.

22
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,762
When you're doing something that

23
00:00:33,762 --> 00:00:35,120
not everyone else is doing, it's

24
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,258
definitely that pressure of like,

25
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:37,239
well what are you doing out there

26
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:38,777
you should come back here with the group.

27
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:40,326
You should come back here with everyone else.

28
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:41,354
And so I almost gave it up and

29
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:42,561
it was really my parents who, like,

30
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:43,890
encouraged me like, no if you like

31
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,776
to do it, go for it.

32
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:47,129
- [Anne] This means the world to him,

33
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,928
and for something that can set him

34
00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:51,881
for the rest of his life, doing what he loves to do.

35
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:53,187
- [Collins] I think to win the show

36
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,092
would be incredible, because not

37
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:55,648
only would I be the youngest magician,

38
00:00:55,648 --> 00:00:57,424
I would be the only magician.

39
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,883
I'm gonna do literally everything to make it to the finals.

40
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:02,932
(clapping)

41
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:05,182
(cheering)

42
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,761
Tonight, I'm putting 250,000 dollars on the line.

43
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,089
Now it's not my money, it's Nick's.

44
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:14,209
(laughs)

45
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:15,573
Nick, are you able to just take

46
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:19,078
that, ridiculously expensive watch?

47
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:20,947
Yeah, alright, great, just take it off for us.

48
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:25,114
I promise to be very careful with it, very careful.

49
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,417
- Hope y'all got insurance America's Got Talent.

50
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:29,572
- Alright, alright, here we go.

51
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:31,725
Alright, it's chill if I change the time right?

52
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:32,558
- No!

53
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:35,330
- Alright, alright, here we go, check it out!

54
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,396
I'm gonna place it over here, very carefully.

55
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:40,896
Alright great, we've also got some cheap watches.

56
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:42,886
(thud)

57
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:43,931
Can't do that with Nick's.

58
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:45,040
(thud)

59
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,831
Awesome, now Howie, please take off your watch.

60
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:48,664
- My watch?

61
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:50,362
- Yes your watch, pull out the stem

62
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:52,985
and change it to a completely different time.

63
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:53,818
- Alright.

64
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:54,825
- Alright.

65
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:57,148
- The renaissance period?

66
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,400
- If you've got the power?

67
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,654
Alright, Heidi, I'm gonna try and

68
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:02,203
mentally influence you to choose a bag

69
00:02:02,203 --> 00:02:04,930
with a cheap watch, so this is very important

70
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,979
Heidi, I need you to look at me.

71
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,896
Bag one, two, or three?

72
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,079
Name one now!

73
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,251
- One!

74
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,251
- One, okay.

75
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:23,207
Alright, Mel B, same thing, one or two?

76
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:25,848
- Two!

77
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:27,719
- Two, are you sure?

78
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,636
- I'm sure!

79
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:33,112
- Alright, bag number two, here we go.

80
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:37,322
Watch.

81
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:38,402
(crash)

82
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:39,725
- Oh my God!

83
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,725
(gasps)

84
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:45,900
(laughs)

85
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,373
- You have my watch!

86
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:49,333
- Alright, Howie, can you please

87
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,126
tell us what time did you change the watch to?

88
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:55,384
- The watch is changed to, read that.

89
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,615
- You can't read it?

90
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:57,694
- Read it.

91
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:58,861
- Hold on.

92
00:02:58,861 --> 00:02:59,694
(laughs)

93
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:01,142
Five o'clock.

94
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:04,142
- Is that rounded, or was that the exact time?

95
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:04,975
- Is that the exact time?

96
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:06,642
- No, it's 4:40, 50.

97
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:08,786
- What?

98
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:09,906
- Is it eight?

99
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:11,305
- 4:40, 50?

100
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:12,138
(laughs)

101
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:13,887
- I like that, 4:40, 50,

102
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:15,245
what do you guys say, yeah?

103
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,563
- 4:58!

104
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,136
- Sorry, what was it?

105
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:19,564
- 4:58.

106
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:20,951
- 4:58.

107
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:21,850
- I think so.

108
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,629
- Alright great, everyone remember the time 4:58.

109
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:27,010
(laughs)

110
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,717
Especially you Nick, you're gonna

111
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:32,419
remember 4:58 for the rest of your life.

112
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:35,316
(laughs)

113
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,500
(crash)

114
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,452
- Whoa.

115
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:38,285
(gasps)

116
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,651
- That doesn't look good.

117
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,748
- Okay.

118
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:41,723
(laughs)

119
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:42,872
- So Heidi, Mel B, let's see if

120
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:45,539
you guys destroyed Nick's watch.

121
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,469
Alright, Nick, here's your watch.

122
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:56,059
Now this is the craziest part,

123
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:58,642
you stopped your watch at 4:58.

124
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,363
- Correct.

125
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:02,863
- I set Nick's watch to, 4:58.

126
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:06,947
- No!

127
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:07,780
(cheering)

128
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,567
- Yeah, come on you guys it's time to make some noise!

129
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:12,722
Yeah!

130
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:14,202
(clapping and cheering)

131
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:15,035
- Wow!

132
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,983
- He had it upside down, it is 4:58.

133
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:19,066
(laughs)

134
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:21,208
I don't know how you did it, but

135
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,525
you lucky, if you would've broke

136
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:23,855
my watch I would've broke my

137
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:26,118
foot off in your you know what.

138
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:27,755
(laughs)

139
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:29,055
