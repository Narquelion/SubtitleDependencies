1
00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:01,008
What's up, guys?

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:01,841
It's Collins Key,

3
00:00:01,841 --> 00:00:04,046
and welcome to the Thursday Vlog.

4
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:04,879
Now, for today's video,

5
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,594
I've got a brand new challenge for you,

6
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:07,870
and I need someone to help me out with this.

7
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,846
You haven't seen him in quite a while,

8
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:11,598
so everyone please welcome back to the Thursday Vlog,

9
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:14,478
the mini-fridge version of me, Devan Key.

10
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:15,311
Hey!

11
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:16,144
Catch the egg!

12
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:16,977
- Oh!

13
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:17,810
- That was close.

14
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,643
For today's video,

15
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,942
we are going to be combining two things.

16
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:21,351
One thing you don't know about us is

17
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:23,094
the fact that we can both juggle.

18
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:25,470
We have juggling skills,

19
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,390
off the skillet, yo.

20
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,279
I don't know what I was doing there.

21
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,112
- Off the skillet...

22
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:28,945
(laughs)

23
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:29,778
- What?

24
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:30,611
And the second thing is

25
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:32,246
you guys love watching us get destroyed by eggs,

26
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:33,783
and so we're combining two of those things today:

27
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,273
the juggling and also the egg-destroying.

28
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:38,267
There's three super difficult rounds to this.

29
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:40,050
Whoever wins the majority of these difficult rounds,

30
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,450
they get to destroy the other person

31
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,290
with a full carton of eggs.

32
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,123
Whoa!

33
00:00:44,123 --> 00:00:44,956
So basically,

34
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:45,789
if you guys are ready for this video,

35
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,498
make sure you guys give it a thumbs up right now.

36
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:49,368
Without any further ado, Devan, catch the egg!

37
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:50,201
- No!

38
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:51,034
- Dude!

39
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:51,867
You ready?

40
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:52,700
- I wasn't ready.

41
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,533
- Catch it, catch it, catch it.

42
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:54,524
Yay, alright, let's do this.

43
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:55,873
Round One, the classic juggle-off!

44
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:56,706
(laughs)

45
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:58,206
Whoever can juggle for the longest wins.

46
00:00:58,206 --> 00:00:59,039
Here we go.

47
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,706
One, two, three, go.

48
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,813
Dude! (mumbles)

49
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:03,646
- Nervewracking!

50
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:07,278
- You can't hit my hands, bro! That's cheating.

51
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:09,168
- Ah! So nervous!

52
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:10,592
- Oh, dude! You can't do that!

53
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,646
(laughs)

54
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:13,551
Well, I lost first.

55
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:15,366
- I lasted like one second longer than you did, so.

56
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,199
- Alright.

57
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:17,105
Yeah, you did, by one second.

58
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:17,938
So, I lose that round.

59
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:19,671
Round Two, not my arms.

60
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:20,504
Yay.

61
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:21,337
They're not really my arms.

62
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:22,254
Whoever gets the most tosses

63
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:23,710
without dropping wins this round.

64
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,678
And, begin.

65
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:27,463
One, two, three, four. Oh! Dude!

66
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:28,638
- Hey, what's up? Hey, hey!

67
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:29,471
- Dude!

68
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:31,327
(laughs)

69
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:32,593
That was so-- Dude, seriously?

70
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,862
(laughs)

71
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:34,695
- Oh! What?

72
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,118
- You can't do-- You can't do that to me, bro!

73
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:39,832
- No! That was not-- No!

74
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,279
I wanna hug you, you know? Just--

75
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,608
- There we go! That's what you get!

76
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:43,616
(laughs)

77
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,376
I kinda-- Oh!

78
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:46,376
Round 3. Ah!

79
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,692
Dude, chill! Chill!

80
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:53,755
(yelling)

81
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:55,043
- Oh, no!

82
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:56,940
It's going into my ear hole!

83
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,459
- Round Three is called stealing.

84
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,475
You'll see why in a second.

85
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,749
Without further ado, let's get started.

86
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:02,582
And begin.

87
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:10,180
Oh, snap! Oh, he's thinkin' about it!

88
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,812
Uh oh! Uh oh! Oh! Oh! See, this is actually-- bro!

89
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:16,787
Devan wins this challenge.

90
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:18,531
He gets to destroy me with a full carton of eggs.

91
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,426
- I'm so psyched.

92
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:22,635
Oh, no! I can do whatever I want!

93
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:23,468
(laughs)

94
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:24,501
- Alright, cool!

95
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:25,334
Let's do it.

96
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:26,167
Give me a thumps up right now

97
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,000
for, like, some encouragement,

98
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,927
'cause I'm not looking forward to this.

99
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:29,937
- I call this move "The Clear."

100
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:30,808
Are you feeling okay?

101
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:31,880
Are you feeling okay?

102
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,713
(machine noise)

103
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:33,546
Clear!

104
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,002
(laugh)

105
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:36,835
- Ow!

106
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:39,818
You just punched me in the chest!

107
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:40,651
(laughs)

108
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,484
Oww!

109
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:42,317
Oh!

110
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:43,330
Oww!

111
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,418
Dude, seriously!

112
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:45,251
You--

113
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,995
- Gosh!

114
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:49,946
- Yeah, I'm a crazy kamikaze.

115
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:51,002
Ay!

116
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:51,875
This is called the pocket egg.

117
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,114
If I really don't want these pants anymore,

118
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:53,995
it's all ready.

119
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:56,078
(laughs)

120
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:05,187
Now, there's like egg yoke running lie all down my leg. Ow!

121
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:06,020
(spitting)

122
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,853
Eww!

123
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,793
You're spitting, like, all over me.

124
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:08,626
Da da da da!

125
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:09,646
Da da da da!

126
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:10,479
Oww!

127
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,312
No!

128
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:12,254
No, no, no, no, no, no!

129
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:13,238
(laughs)

130
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:14,071
Oww!

131
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:14,904
My nipple!

132
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:18,354
- Whoa, dude!

133
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:19,187
No!

134
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:20,172
- Oww!

135
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:21,283
(laughs)

136
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:22,116
- Oh, yeah!

137
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:23,076
It got my freakin' arms!

138
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:23,909
Oh!

139
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,665
No!

140
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,661
- Oww!

141
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:29,494
Ooh!

142
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:30,327
That hurts! Leg!

143
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:31,253
One egg left.

144
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,191
I've got one shot to hit him.

145
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:33,024
Go for it.

146
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:35,821
- Yeah!

147
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:36,654
Yes!

148
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:37,487
- There's another egg!

149
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:39,269
- Oh, no! Ah!

150
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:40,102
- Whoo!
