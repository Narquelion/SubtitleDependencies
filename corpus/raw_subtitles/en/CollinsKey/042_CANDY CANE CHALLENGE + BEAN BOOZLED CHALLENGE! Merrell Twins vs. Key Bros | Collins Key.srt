1
00:00:00,263 --> 00:00:02,824
- What's up, it's Collins Key and welcome to my new video.

2
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:04,952
Now, for today's video I've got some special guests

3
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:06,374
who are going to be joining me.

4
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:07,921
First of all, everyone please welcome the

5
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:09,266
beautiful Merrell Twins.

6
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:10,099
Hey!

7
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:11,807
(clapping)

8
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:13,720
Hello, say hello.

9
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,768
And actually, you know what,

10
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:15,945
instead of just having the Merrell Twins,

11
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,490
I've got one more special guest.

12
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,550
I thought he jumped out already.

13
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,952
Everyone please welcome my little brother, Devan Key.

14
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:22,326
- [All] Yay!

15
00:00:22,326 --> 00:00:23,343
- What's up?

16
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:24,399
- How are you?

17
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,060
We've got the whole squad assembled and today we're

18
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,513
going head to head challenging each other right now.

19
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:33,603
It's going to be the Key Bros versus--

20
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:35,896
- [Both] The Merrell Twins.

21
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:37,626
- [All] Yay!

22
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:40,601
- We are going to be doing the candy cane taste-testing

23
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:43,567
challenge; so basically we had a third party, my dad,

24
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,640
go out to the store and buy a whole bunch of

25
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,865
different flavored candy canes.

26
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:49,672
We don't know what flavors these candy canes are.

27
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:52,482
One person on each team is going to be blindfolded,

28
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:54,675
the other person is going to feed them the candy cane

29
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:56,999
and that person has to guess what flavor it is.

30
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:00,013
Whichever team guesses, I like your interpretation--

31
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,059
- We were demonstrating what you were saying.

32
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:05,653
- I like it; so whichever team guesses correctly first,

33
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:07,685
that team wins that round.

34
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:09,883
Whichever team wins the majority of the rounds,

35
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:11,481
they win the overall challenge.

36
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:14,898
And the prize is a giant Pez Santa Claus.

37
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:17,254
What?

38
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:18,087
- It's a musical--

39
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:18,920
- Musical?

40
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
- [All] Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

41
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:24,669
- All right, okay.

42
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:25,849
- Is there a sample?

43
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:26,875
- No sample.

44
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,483
The winner gets to discover the wonders

45
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:31,196
of the musical dispenser.

46
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:35,140
Also they win this legit lightsaber right here.

47
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,704
I don't want to do just an ordinary candy cane

48
00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:39,948
taste testing thing, I gotta take it up a notch.

49
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:42,724
We're combining the candy cane taste testing with

50
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:44,963
the Bean Boozled challenge.

51
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:47,239
How the Bean Boozled challenge ties into all this

52
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,805
is that whichever team guesses incorrectly,

53
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:52,565
they both have to eat, I'm pointing at you guys,

54
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:56,732
they both have to eat one of the Bean Boozled beans.

55
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,914
- You're either gonna get a good flavor or a bad flavor

56
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:02,338
- That's really going to mess with your tastebuds

57
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:03,929
for the rest of the challenge, so that's basically

58
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:04,762
how it works.

59
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:06,585
Also, I'm doing a giveaway on my channel right now

60
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,822

70
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:30,761
to the Candy Cane, Bean Boozled challenge?

71
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:32,714
- Yeah, sure, let's do it.

72
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:34,260
- Yeah!

73
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,676
Ladies, you get to decide first:

74
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:36,899
which one do you want to do?

75
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:37,804
- This one. - No.

76
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,312
(laughs)

77
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:41,229
- We wanna do this one.

78
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:45,811
- Let's do one over here.

79
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,156
- Okay which one do you wanna do?

80
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:47,989
- This one.

81
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:48,919
- No.

82
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,127
- Take a look at the flavor.

83
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,024
- Wait, hold on.

84
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:52,468
- You don't taste it.

85
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:55,664
- Open up your mouth; three, two, one, go.

86
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:56,565
- Bubble gum?

87
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:57,424
- No.

88
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:59,253
- Are you gonna guess at all?

89
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:02,086
Smell it, what does it smell like?

90
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:05,830
- It's gotta be bubble gum, there's no other way.

91
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,496
- It's not bubble gum!

92
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:08,329
- Pizza?

93
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,962
- What does it smell like?

94
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:11,379
- Dude, smell it.

95
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:14,952
- A peach, a plum, a strawberry?

96
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:21,270
- Banana.

97
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,103
- Nooooo!

98
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:28,393
First of all before you put it on,

99
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:30,062
we've gotta do our Bean Boozled thing.

100
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:31,565
- I'm not ready for this

101
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:32,541
- I'm not either.

102
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,012
I'm doing two.

103
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:34,845
- Noooo!

104
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:42,166
- Mine tastes really good, like toothpaste.

105
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,279
- It's not toothpaste, it's earwax.

106
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,175
- Why'd you do two?

107
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:46,398
- I felt dangerous.

108
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:50,311
- I went with one and I made the right decision.

109
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:51,493
- I'm a little bit nervous.

110
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:53,093
- I'm nervous too.

111
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:54,593
Three, two, one...

112
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,227
- Chocolate.

113
00:03:58,227 --> 00:03:59,241
- Caramel.

114
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,207
- Licorice.

115
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,305
- Wooooo!

116
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:03,388
- Noooooo, what, already?

117
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,271
- Man!

118
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,104
- Yeah!

119
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:09,183
- I love that one.

120
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,987
I'll take the green one, which I think is booger.

121
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:13,167
- Booger is disgusting.

122
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,084
- I already know it's gonna be bad.

123
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:19,524
- I can't tell.

124
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:21,477
- It's gross, I can smell it.

125
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:23,727
(laughter)

126
00:04:25,305 --> 00:04:26,338
- I swallowed mine whole.

127
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:28,783
- It smells like jalapeno.

128
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:30,817
- Note to anyone out there, this is not a good food

129
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:32,241
for a date at all.

130
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:33,326
I'm gonna go for this one here.

131
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:35,284
No pressure but we are doing terrible right now.

132
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:37,117
- Three, two, one, go.

133
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,691
- Strawberry, cranberry.

134
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:41,633
- Grape?

135
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,550
- Yeah, she said grape!

136
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:45,579
- What is it?

137
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,412
- Grape!

138
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,705
- Are you for real?

139
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:50,111
Did I really get it?

140
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:53,111
Grape is one of my favorite flavors.

141
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:56,790
- No!

142
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,996
- All right.

143
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:00,163
- Do not eat two, do not eat two.

144
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:02,075
- I'm going for two.

145
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:05,285
(horn blaring)

146
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,869
- My throat is not allowing me to swallow.

147
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:11,313
- Plug your nose and swallow.

148
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:13,896
- They both plugged their nose.

149
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,852
(retching cough)

150
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:19,784
- I think our lucky streak might end.

151
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:22,019
Oh, Devan, you're screwed bro.

152
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,852
- One, two, three, go.

153
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:26,754
- Good luck bro.

154
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:28,081
- Licorice, twizzler.

155
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:29,370
- You can't just stuff it in my mouth.

156
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,810
- That's what you did to me.

157
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,060
(laughter)

158
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:39,345
- Is it raisins?

159
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:42,070
- The first part of the word is "butter."

160
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,903
- Buttermilk?

161
00:05:42,903 --> 00:05:45,612
- Oh! Root, or butter beer?

162
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,842
- What? That's Harry Potter, bro!

163
00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:49,063
- Butter pret...

164
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:50,403
(choking laugh)

165
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:51,666
- Like hop...

166
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,890
- No!

167
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,218
- Dude, get it!

168
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:55,070
- Butter bunny?

169
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,903
- Hop...

170
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,160
- Hop...

171
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,993
- Hop...

172
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:01,221
- To? Butter to?

173
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,970
- Like when your jumping, you're playing hop...

174
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,393
- Scotch! Butterscotch!

175
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:07,045
- Oh my God! Noooooooo!

176
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,348
Noooooooooo!

177
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,445
- He's crying.

178
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:10,953
- I'm not crying...whoah!

179
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,542
- To make things fair, we'll take one.

180
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:13,375
- Really?

181
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,376
- Yeah.

182
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:15,556
- They are the real MVP.

183
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:16,973
Open it up first.

184
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:20,079
- I got toothpaste.

185
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,515
- That's the best one!

186
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,079
- Collins, take my advice do the grass.

187
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,830
- Alright, I'm going for grass.

188
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,258
You got another blue one?

189
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:28,725
- But there's three.

190
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:32,475
- I'm taking grass, I'm going easy on myself.

191
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:38,665
- I can't do it, I can't do it.

192
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:39,832
This is vomit!

193
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,027
- You would get vomit on your first try.

194
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:51,009
- It's stuck in my teeth.

195
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:51,842
I'm okay.

196
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,983
Put the next flavor in my mouth.

197
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:55,733
- Three, two, one go!

198
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,421
- Go go go go go!

199
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:05,932
- It hurts right?

200
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,641
- Fruit rollup fruit?

201
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,352
- No, It is an actual fruit I think.

202
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:10,689
- Is it?

203
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:11,522
- Kumquat!

204
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:13,859
- Kumquat?

205
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,733
- But it has the word fruit in it?

206
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,280
- I think it is a fruit.

207
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,119
- Dragon fruit?

208
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:20,952
- No.

209
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:24,473
- The word is hard!

210
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,586
- Broccoli fruit?

211
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:28,986
- Cactus fruit, pear fruit, avacado fruit?

212
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:30,080
Because avacado is a fruit.

213
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,864
- There's not an actual fruit in the name of it.

214
00:07:33,864 --> 00:07:35,571
- No, that's a bad hint.

215
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,904
This word, it's a feeling...

216
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:41,631
- Happy fruit, sad fruit, angry fruit!

217
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:44,359
Terrible fruit, horrible fruit, depressed fruit!

218
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,776
- Tropical fruit!

219
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:48,387
- Romantic fruit!

220
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:49,527
- It's along that line!

221
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,399
- Love heart!

222
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,482
- Love fruit!

223
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,755
- Come on, come on, come on!

224
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,873
- Romantic fruit, date fruit, date fruit!

225
00:07:57,873 --> 00:07:58,972
- No, no, no, no, no!

226
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:00,153
- Romantic wedding fruit!

227
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:01,613
- No.

228
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:02,877
- Meant to be fruit?

229
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:06,409
The one and only fruit? Wedding ring fruit?

230
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:09,012
- Have you actually heard it said before?

231
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:13,046
- The first letter of the first word is "P."

232
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:15,689
- Pear fruit! Pineapple Fruit!

233
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:18,522
- It's not another frickin' fruit!

234
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:23,515
- Perfect fruit.

235
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:25,025
- Come on, close...

236
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,857
- Passionate? Passion fruit!

237
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,116
Yeah!

238
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:29,033
Wooo, yeah!

239
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:36,472
Sorry, I think we just got too lit.

240
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:39,693
- Here you guys go, have fun.

241
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,079
- Oh, I got peach.

242
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:41,923
- Yay.

243
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:43,796
- I got frickin dog food.

244
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:45,178
- She's like: it's a feeling.

245
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:47,937
I was like: annoyed fruit; she's like "that's how I feel"

246
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:49,155
- First point for the...

247
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,738
- For the Key bros.

248
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:53,221
Okay.

249
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:57,216
- [Together] Yaaaaaa!

250
00:08:57,216 --> 00:08:59,450
- Here we go: three, two, one go.

251
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,283
- Pear.

252
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:01,481
- No.

253
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:02,580
- Give it back to me.

254
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,413
- Um...

255
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:05,330
- Oh, I got this! Nope.

256
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,874
- Pear?

257
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:08,707
- No.

258
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:10,018
- I thought you got it.

259
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:10,851
- Pineapple.

260
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:11,684
- Yep.

261
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:13,868
- Is it?

262
00:09:13,868 --> 00:09:15,169
- Yep, it's pineapple.

263
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:16,757
- Doesn't taste like pineapple!

264
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:17,693
- Yeah it does!

265
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:19,849
- We're back to the beans.

266
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:22,298
- Oh man, that didn't work.

267
00:09:22,298 --> 00:09:23,131
- Ha!

268
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:23,993
- We can cut that out, right?

269
00:09:23,993 --> 00:09:24,826
(beep)

270
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:25,659
- Oh, God.

271
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,125
- What'd you get?

272
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,032
- Booger or somethin.

273
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:28,865
- Toss it.

274
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:31,977
- Ew, boogers.

275
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:33,729
(retches)

276
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,073
- No.

277
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:36,406
- You got skunk?

278
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,437
(coughs)

279
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:41,270
- Oh!

280
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:43,205
- Sorry, you got a breath full?

281
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:45,078
- You coughed right in my face.

282
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:47,357
- My breath is horrible right now.

283
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:48,734
- Hey now!

284
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,067
Three, two, one!

285
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:54,699
- Blueberry!

286
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:55,532
- No.

287
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:56,365
- Toothpaste!

288
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:57,198
- No.

289
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:58,260
- I know it but I don't.

290
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,174
- Yeah bro, you know it, come on.

291
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:01,208
- Oh, root beer.

292
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,041
- Oh my!

293
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:06,103
- Root beer float.

294
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:07,444
- I'm not gonna take off my blindfold right now

295
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:10,101
cause I'm actually crying.

296
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:11,284
Oh God.

297
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:12,869
- No! No, no, no, no!

298
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:14,746
- Yep, yep, yep, yep!

299
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:18,413
- I'm not taking that one, I'm not doing it.

300
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,367
- You are taking this one!

301
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:26,783
- We got either popcorn or rotten egg.

302
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:27,675
- I am not doing that.

303
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:29,592
- I am not doing skunk.

304
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:32,197
It is either vomit.

305
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:34,364
- Mine's either earwax or.

306
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:36,890
(retches)

307
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,766
- I can't tell if I got peach or vomit.

308
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:39,982
- I got a good one!

309
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:41,608
- I got vomit, for sure.

310
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,441
- I'm good.

311
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,691
(mumbling)

312
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,200
- They know what color

313
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,298
- I know what it is.

314
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:56,548
- We'll change.

315
00:10:57,536 --> 00:10:59,076
- You guys kept it the same.

316
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,478
You kept it the same.

317
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:03,559
- You guys are good.

318
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,188
- They kept it the same again!

319
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:07,097
- Dude, you know me so well!

320
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:09,819
- I didn't see the flavor

321
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:10,652
- Go.

322
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:11,485
- Blueberry!

323
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:12,906
- No.

324
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:13,757
- Green apple?

325
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,590
- Blackberry.

326
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,423
- Raspberry.

327
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:16,256
- Yeah, yeah!

328
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:17,089
- Oh yes!

329
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:20,688
(cheering)

330
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,380
- Wow, dude.

331
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:25,581
Calm down there.

332
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:27,731
- One, two,

333
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:32,654
I don't even want to know what.

334
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:37,530
I can smell it from my breath

335
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,197
and it smells like stinky socks.

336
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:42,819
- You swallow it?

337
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:43,652
- Uh huh.

338
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:44,485
- Wow.

339
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:45,485
- High five.

340
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,903
- We need a palate cleanser, that's what we need.

341
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:54,403
- Three, two, one.

342
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,099
- Come on bro.

343
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:58,932
- Blueberry?

344
00:11:58,932 --> 00:11:59,849
- Raspberry?

345
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:00,682
- Oh! Cotton candy!

346
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:01,515
- Yes!

347
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:04,809
- The tables have drastically turned

348
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,929
as the challenge has progressed.

349
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:08,226
- I want the brown one!

350
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:10,393
(arguing)

351
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:17,208
- The other one's either peach or something else.

352
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,959
- The brown one's canned dog food.

353
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,422
- Chocolate pudding!

354
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:21,766
That's what I got.

355
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:23,349
- I got barf again.

356
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:27,954
- You okay?

357
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:29,623
- I'm just perfectly fine.

358
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,070
- If you do not get this one,

359
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,819
you are not my brother Devan.

360
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:34,672
- Okay, ready?

361
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:36,545
One, two, three, go.

362
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:37,462
- Cinnamon.

363
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:41,276
Cinnamon is my absolute favorite thing ever.

364
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:42,699
- And mine too!

365
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,083
- It tastes exactly like cinnamon too.

366
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,833
Accurate, taste-wise.

367
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:48,536
- Not quite.

368
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:50,619
- Cinnamon is more spicy.

369
00:12:56,996 --> 00:12:59,829
- Rotten egg, or buttered popcorn.

370
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,695
- These are so gross.

371
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,434
- Buttered popcorn!

372
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:12,421

422
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:46,946

423
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:47,880
I can taste it.

- Yeah!

432
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:11,290
- We didn't even get it in our mouth.

433
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,189
What are you doing?

434
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:13,689

435
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:18,768
