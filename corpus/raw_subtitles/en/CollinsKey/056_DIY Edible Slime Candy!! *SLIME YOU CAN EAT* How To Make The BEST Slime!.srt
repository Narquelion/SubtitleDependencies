1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,784
- You want to see me eat the sourest slime in the world.

2
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:04,617
(howling)

3
00:00:04,617 --> 00:00:05,450
You challenged me to make

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,626
DIY edible candy slime.

5
00:00:07,626 --> 00:00:10,600
And first of all, I had no idea you were even able to eat

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,611
certain types of slime.

7
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,062
But we are doing three types.

8
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:15,198
We're doing the gummy slime, we're doing the candy slime

9
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:17,450
where we mix a whole bunch of candy into the gummy slime

10
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,085
and the last one, I have to eat sour slime.

11
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,240
I didn't even know that was a thing.

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,486
It involves malic acid, toxic waste,

13
00:00:23,486 --> 00:00:25,271
and my taste buds becoming destroyed.

14
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:26,690
That's happening at the end of the video

15
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,992
but right now to kick things off,

16
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,870
we need to melt some gummy bears.

17
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,114
That is a lot, that's like the most amount

18
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:34,564
of gummy bears I've seen in my entire life.

19
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:35,502
And one thing to be cautious of

20
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,692
is when you melt them in the microwave

21
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,529
only do increments of 10 seconds,

22
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:39,992
otherwise it might burn.

23
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:42,700
So, right now, let's go heat 'em up.

24
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,899
One thing that I think is very important,

25
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,041
is that you learn from my mistakes in these videos

26
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,298
and I just made a massive mistake,

27
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,117
I had this brilliant idea that if I combine

28
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:51,548
all the colors, it would make a beautiful rainbow.

29
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,731
Instead it looks like this

30
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:55,628
and guys this does not look appealing.

31
00:00:55,628 --> 00:00:57,755
This looks kind of like caramel,

32
00:00:57,755 --> 00:00:59,640
kinda a little bit like something else.

33
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,263
I'm not about the color of this,

34
00:01:01,263 --> 00:01:02,833
it's not aesthetically pleasing.

35
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,576
So for this, I went a little bit extra

36
00:01:04,576 --> 00:01:06,718
and I actually divided out all the different colors,

37
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:08,163
so this can be for the basic slime,

38
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:09,567
this will be for the candy slime

39
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,487
and this will be for the sour slime.

40
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:12,602
Colored coded and everything.

41
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,292
I just melted up all the blue gummy bears

42
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:18,201
and this looks so much better, like this looks so cool.

43
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:20,972
It looks like the ocean is in gummy form.

44
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:22,596
Like this looks delicious, I'm so excited.

45
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,935
Next up is the corn starch and then the powdered sugar

46
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:27,594
so I'm going to add an equal amount in here.

47
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:28,835
Mix it all around, put it in here

48
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:30,281
and that's what's going to create the slime.

49
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,447
So, the powder sugar is

50
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:34,083
what's going to turn this into a, no!

51
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,030
I'm so bad at this.

52
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,741
Wow, my DIY skills are not good at all

53
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,921
I'm definitely not Grady Garcia, that is for sure.

54
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:42,478
The cornstarch is really cool because it actually

55
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,306
makes it were the slime won't stick to you.

56
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:45,344
And I remember this stuff

57
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:47,298
from when we made that giant pool of Oobleck,

58
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:50,343
and so, yeah, I know the smell of cornstarch.

59
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,060
Hm, very well.

60
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,866
(upbeat music)

61
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:55,699
- [Man On Left] Oh my god.

62
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,616
- Holy cow.

63
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:00,636
And John's in it for real.

64
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:02,065
- So we're gonna dump a little bit in right now

65
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,755
I really messed this up because you're supposed

66
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:04,851
to put them both in this bowl

67
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,725
and then mix them together, but

68
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:07,558
(laughs)

69
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:09,350
I think I'm gonna do away with the spoon right now.

70
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,567
We're gonna go in with the hands

71
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:11,843
and just go crazy.

72
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:15,014
Alright, so get the last of the slime off the spoon

73
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:18,260
Ooh, this already feels so weird and so sticky.

74
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,356
It doesn't feel at all like slime.

75
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:20,621
It literally just feels like

76
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:22,321
well, of course, like melted gummy bears.

77
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,673
But, I don't know what to do with the spoon,

78
00:02:23,673 --> 00:02:24,837
so I'm gonna just leave it over here.

79
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:25,995
A little bit of cross contamination

80
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:26,923
never hurt anybody (laughing)

81
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:28,315
said no scientist ever.

82
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,326
So, alright, I think I'm gonna have to

83
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:30,970
go with both hands here

84
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,382
We're gonna try to work it through.

85
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:34,208
The great thing is it's not really like sticking.

86
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,076
No, it's sticking to me.

87
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:35,957
It's definitely uh

88
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:37,133
yeah, it's all over me.

89
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:37,966
This is not good.

90
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:39,646
Okay, this is not even like candy.

91
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:40,787
This doesn't look appealing at the moment.

92
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,667
How does this look?

93
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:43,500
Not good.

94
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,732
This is just a hot mess, man.

95
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:45,988
It's just a hot mess.

96
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:47,822
It looks like an alien substance, too,

97
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:50,036
I mean, it doesn't even look like an appealing slime video.

98
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,702
Like ya know when you see the videos on Instagram

99
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:52,535
where they're playing with it?

100
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:53,805
It looks so beautiful, like aawww?

101
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:54,907
And it looks so gorgeous?

102
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,573
Yeah, this...

103
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:57,406
that doesn't look good.

104
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:58,239
It's getting there a little bit.

105
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,915
I just need a lot more of the powdered sugar

106
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:00,748
and the cornstarch.

107
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:01,771
I'm gonna, aha it's on the back of my hand,

108
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:03,643
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

109
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:04,832
Can we get a little more of the powdered sugar

110
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,665
and then we're gonna go from there.

111
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:06,810
I think I need a bigger bowl, though.

112
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,649
Alright, now time to transfer into the bigger bowl, so

113
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,138
Ah, it's dripping, it's dripping,

114
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:12,463
it's dripping, it's dripping

115
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:13,458
Ah, ah.

116
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,280
It's so stressful, okay, now it's all in my hands.

117
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,249
So how do I get it off my hands?

118
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:17,332
Like, I need.

119
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,161
I don't know how to do this.

120
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,184
Melted gummy bears is a very sticky substance.

121
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:25,184
It's getting even worse.

122
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:27,212
Okay, yeah, that's not happening.

123
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:30,468
Oh, it's actually turning into slime.

124
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:31,499
I cracked the code.

125
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:32,332
I'm a genius.

126
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:33,282
I had no idea that would work,

127
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,694
so now we take it to the next level,

128
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:36,487
and I'll now put the powdered sugar and

129
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:38,194
cornstarch in my hands,

130
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:40,227
and I'm going all hand action right now.

131
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:41,060
This is just

132
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,396
you can use the thumbs to kinda mush it in.

133
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:43,780
So, look, I open up a little bit and

134
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,912
then we push together like this,

135
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:46,176
and then, kinda, squeeze,

136
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,406
and manipulate, and it all falls out, man.

137
00:03:48,406 --> 00:03:50,606
It's the issue that's not combining it

138
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,439
That's my issue with it.

139
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,105
It's just, and then gets stringy.

140
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:53,938
Fam.

141
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:55,299
Hm.

142
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:56,132
Why stringy?

143
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:57,033
So let's make this, Eric.

144
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:58,579
I was gonna go back to this technique

145
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,357
it's just so much powder.

146
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:01,292
So much powder in the air.

147
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,125
So we go here, and we're

148
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,841
gonna try to use like the high-five technique on it.

149
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:05,077
(gasps) It's getting so much better, actually.

150
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:05,910
Look at this.

151
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,252
It's getting, oh my gosh, yes, yes.

152
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:08,169
Bless, yes.

153
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:12,167
Here we go, I'm gonna take a handful of it now

154
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:15,376
I'm gonna retrieve some more of it down here

155
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:16,209
Okay, there we go.

156
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,322
My slime gonna eat it.

157
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:18,155
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

158
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:19,845
This is like a real work-out, too, man.

159
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:20,852
I've gotta do this two more times.

160
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:21,685
Holy cow.

161
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:22,999
I wonder if I can make a giant bubble with it.

162
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:24,698
'Cause you guys know I'm great at blowing bubbles

163
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,811
when it comes to the slime.

164
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,443
(blowing)

165
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:28,276
Nope.

166
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:29,276
It's starting to peel off my hands now

167
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:30,592
which is kind of like what it's supposed to do,

168
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:32,462
but at the same time, its not like,

169
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:33,654
it's getting more slimy.

170
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:34,511
But this looks actually

171
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:36,636
really, really, really cool.

172
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:38,037
Aw.

173
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:40,261
Aw, man, there's so much powdered sugar everywhere.

174
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:41,094
The, ugh.

175
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:41,927
It is getting better, though.

176
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:42,760
It is getting a lot better.

177
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,162
This takes a lot of hand strength.

178
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:46,747
You've gotta see the full extension of this, like.

179
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:48,413
Ah, what's up.

180
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,354
(light-hearted music)

181
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:50,187
Oh!

182
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:51,020
That just shot everywhere.

183
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,853
That was not good, you gotta see this.

184
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:53,044
We're starting to get sliminess.

185
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,263
Okay, yeah, 'cause it's starting to come off my hands.

186
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,096
That's a good sign.

187
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:56,916
Oh, yeah, mmhm.

188
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,425
Turn up, it's my party time.

189
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,804
Next up I'm gonna be tasting it

190
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:02,094
because I think it's kinds getting to

191
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,149
like slime levels.

192
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,631
If I can just get it off my hands

193
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:05,464
and not as sticky,

194
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:07,026
then we'll be in very good shape.

195
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:07,859
That didn't work.

196
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:08,692
It's all over my hands,

197
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:09,525
but we're gonna go with it.

198
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:10,358
(coughing)

199
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:11,480
Eventually.

200
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,813
Alright, guys, I think we've gotten into

201
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,582
a really, really good place now.

202
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,348
Look at this slime, it looks so cool.

203
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:17,547
So right now I'm about to taste this

204
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:18,380
edible candy slime,

205
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,068
but first I've got a challenge.

206
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:22,294
I wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel.

207
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:24,214

209
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:27,239

Here we go. you ready?

211
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:31,405
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one,

212
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:34,486
Done, if you can do that,

213
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,436

214
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,742
and we're gonna be going through and replying to people

215
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:39,418
who are able to do all three of those things

216
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:40,251
in seven seconds.

217
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:41,475
By the way please don't comment

218
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,580
about how bad that hand countdown was.

219
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,591
I've slime on my hands.

220
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:45,424
Here we go.

221
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:46,580
I get to eat this candy slime that

222
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,803
looks so delicious.

223
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:49,715
It looks like cotton candy.

224
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:50,556
Here we go three,

225
00:05:50,556 --> 00:05:51,432
I'm just gonna go.

226
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:52,495
Two, I'm so excited.

227
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:53,328
One.

228
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:56,637
Mmm.

229
00:05:56,637 --> 00:05:57,890
That was really good.

230
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,819
This stuff is like super sticky as well.

231
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:00,652
And you put it in your mouth

232
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,801
and it's like sticks to every area of your mouth.

233
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:03,907
It makes you feel like you can't talk.

234
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:05,182
Like this is the inside of your mouth.

235
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:08,015
You try and talk and like, oh man.

236
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:12,085
(laughing) This is so cool.

237
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,800
Right now we're taking this to the next level.

238
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,949
(laughing) I love how my hands look.

239
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:15,782
High five.

240
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,061
They don't stick.

241
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:19,228
What happened?

242
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,392
(laughing) It's so cool.

243
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:22,849
This is when things get really exciting because

244
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,132
we're doing the exact same thing

245
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:25,143
with the red ones,

246
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:27,166
only this time we're adding a tonne of candy

247
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,358
and then for the last one

248
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,393
we're doing a tonne of sour candies.

249
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,499
Right now, lets heat these up

250
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:33,593
and lets make, let's make that slime.

251
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,426
Woohoo.

252
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:36,752
Now this looks so delicious.

253
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:39,065
It literally looks like strawberry jelly.

254
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,869
And I wanna eat it right now,

255
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:41,933
but I have to us patience.

256
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,681
I have to first mix in everything.

257
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:44,575
Last time we did this, that was

258
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:45,797
my first time doing it,

259
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:47,321
and it definitely didn't go according to plan.

260
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:49,673
So this time we're gonna be much more precise about it.

261
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:51,237
We have the mixing bowl right over here.

262
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:53,847
So we're gonna take the cornstarch first

263
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,377
add that into the bowl.

264
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,586
And then next we take the powdered sugar,

265
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:00,647
gonna add an equal amount into the bowl as well

266
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:01,794
Feel like a true baker right now.

267
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:03,460
And this time instead of playing with my hands

268
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,293
I'm gonna be professional

269
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,084
and use a spoon to mix it all up.

270
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:08,829
So we're gonna dump it all in.

271
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:09,662
That's a lot.

272
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,013
And then we're gonna just kind of go for it.

273
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,329
Here we go.

274
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,329
Yo, that looks so crazy.

275
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:17,380
Yeah, so I think this is, okay note to self

276
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,587
this is definitely working a lot better

277
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:19,887
than what I did with my hands.

278
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:21,767
So, I've pulled a lot of shenanigans before

279
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,092
I don't know why I didn't do it

280
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,333
the way you're supposed to do it before.

281
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,264
But this, it almost looks like a candy cane right now.

282
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,697
Just like the way the white is mixing in with the red.

283
00:07:29,697 --> 00:07:30,760
I'm gonna mix it up a little bit more.

284
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,065
Oh, you know what this reminds me of?

285
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:33,490
It reminds me of those deserts,

286
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,323
What are they called?

287
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,156
They're like,

288
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:36,451
you find them in like Japanese restaurants.

289
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:37,573
Oh, mochi, that's it.

290
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:38,406
It's called a mochi,

291
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:40,591
and it's like this ice creamy kind of desert

292
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:42,487
that looks like it has the same texture as this.

293
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:43,672
And I think it's like powdered sugar

294
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,771
or flour, or something.

295
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:46,314
I don't know, some mysterious substance on the outside,

296
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:48,216
but, man, it's getting really tough to move.

297
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,228
Okay, here we go.

298
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:50,257
Oh my gosh.

299
00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:51,437
My hand's getting so tired.

300
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,270
Oh my gosh

301
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,402
I like, want to get my hands on it.

302
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:54,235
Okay, I think

303
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:55,144
I'm done with this spoon, guys.

304
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:56,124
I wanna get my hands on this stuff.

305
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,790
It looks, looks so cool.

306
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,439
Hopefully it won't be as sticky as last time.

307
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,780
'Cause last time, ya know, it was pretty intense.

308
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,613
But here we go.

309
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:02,509
I'm gonna pick it up.

310
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:03,893
Let's see, oh.

311
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:05,391
It feels so cool.

312
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:06,853
It's like really stringy,

313
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,782
really hot, but definitely not as sticky

314
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:10,172
I think because it has like a tonne of cornstarch

315
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:11,634
coating it right now.

316
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:13,896
I'm just kinda like mix it up, oh.

317
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:15,103
This is so cool.

318
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,260
Yeah, it's definitely very sticky.

319
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,271
I should've coated my hands first.

320
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:18,578
What was I thinking, No, no, no I need to be a baker.

321
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:20,144
Think baker, think baker thoughts.

322
00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:21,169
No!

323
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,002
Here we go.

324
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:22,835
Rescue myself.

325
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,668
Rescue myself.

326
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:24,518
Remove, remove, okay.

327
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:26,012
This hand only has a little bit of slime on it,

328
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:28,512
so I'm gonna try to coat here.

329
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:33,658
I'm gonna try to coat this hand in cornstarch.

330
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:34,491
Here we go.

331
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:37,033
I should have definitely done this beforehand.

332
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,518
But here we go, okay.

333
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,101
So if I coat my hand in cornstarch,

334
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:43,684
theoretically, the slime won't stick to me.

335
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:46,586
Yeah, my theory didn't work, it's still sticking to me, so

336
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:47,587
I went way too early.

337
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:48,420
I should've been patient.

338
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,253
I should've used patience.

339
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,598
It smells really good, but I should've used patience.

340
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,092
Two hours later.

341
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:53,326
Well now it's turned into more like

342
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,609
a snowball than anything else

343
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:56,945
cuss it's like whee. (laughing)

344
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:58,561
This stuff is crazy, but it's looking

345
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:59,861
like slime as well,

346
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:01,655
and so now it's time to add

347
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:03,347
the candy into what's going on.

348
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:04,180
Right now what I'm gonna do

349
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,430
is I'm actually gonna take this

350
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,445
and then I'm gonna open it up

351
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,942
and use it as kind of like a bowl.

352
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,931
I'm gonna dump all the candy into it.

353
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:11,022
And then, after that,

354
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:12,369
we're gonna mix it all together and

355
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:13,432
taste it to see

356
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:15,149
how the candy-gummies slime tastes.

357
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:17,070
So first I think we're gonna add in some

358
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,526
good old jelly beans.

359
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,013
Oh, way too many jelly beans.

360
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:25,054
Alright, we're gonna use a few Gob Stoppers,

361
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:26,148
Okay, perfect, oh, no.

362
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,196
That green one, man, that was uncalled for.

363
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:30,119
I was not expecting you, you are not supposed to be here,

364
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,177
But I'll let you stay, you're cool.

365
00:09:31,177 --> 00:09:32,089
Next we'll add some Pop Rocks,

366
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:35,251
and these things kinda trip me out, hold up.

367
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,084
Ugh.

368
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,956
(fireworks exploding)

369
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:40,002
In my haste and excitement,

370
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,252
I kinda used up

371
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:43,096
kinda all of them.

372
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:44,549
At least we got to enjoy them one way or another.

373
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:45,754
And then next we have these

374
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:48,550
Are these Pop Rocks as well?

375
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,378
(bleating)

376
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:52,211
Nope, okay.

377
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:53,498
We'll add these in here.

378
00:09:53,498 --> 00:09:54,576
That looks so cool.

379
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:57,747
Also got some Razzles we're gonna add into the mix here.

380
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:00,321
Perfect, and then we have some of these things here.

381
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:02,131
These are Cookie Dough Birthday Cake Bites.

382
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:04,070
I've heard that these are amazing,

383
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,116
so I'm really excited to add these.

384
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:05,975
That was a lot of them.

385
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:06,891
But that's eh, that fine.

386
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:09,267
Alright, we're gonna kinda squish them in.

387
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:10,184
This is looking delicious.

388
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:12,011
I think we've also got some, um, some Nerds.

389
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,011
I'm gonna add these in.

390
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,831
Perfect.

391
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:20,431
We have now entered the Nerd zone.

392
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:22,139
Alright, here we go, the moment of truth

393
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,670
to see if we can mix all this candy into it.

394
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,649
So, I don't know how to do this.

395
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,774
I'm just gonna kinda squish it together.

396
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:28,341
This is not gonna work at all.

397
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,821
I have little faith

398
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:30,888
Little to no faith at the moment.

399
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:32,600
We're gonna use the thumb technique again.

400
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,327
The thumb massage is kinda thumb it over.

401
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:35,509
The thumb technique comes in handy, man.

402
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,335
Very versatile if you can master the thumb technique

403
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:39,160
you're good, so I'm just gonna kinda like turn,

404
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,386
implant them all inside of it. (gasps)

405
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:44,746
This is working, oh my gosh, yes.

406
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,720
I literally thought there was no way this would work,

407
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,095
but this is actually working.

408
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:48,928
Hold up.

409
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,349
This is crazy.

410
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,590
As long as there all stuck in there,

411
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,102
that's the most important thing.

412
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:54,514
(grunting)

413
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:57,437
Yo, that's like looking so cool.

414
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:58,636
Yes!

415
00:10:58,636 --> 00:10:59,485
Woohoo!

416
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:01,354
I'm hyped right now.

417
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:02,231
Woohoo!

418
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:05,231
This was a massive success.

419
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,064
Now is the moment

420
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:07,186
you've all been waiting for.

421
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:10,969
Time to taste the candy, DIY edible slime

422
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:14,966
here we go, three, two, I'm so excited

423
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:15,943
There we go.

424
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:16,776
One.

425
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:20,404
Mmm.

426
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:21,385
Alright, I'm gonna take another bite.

427
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:22,373
This stuff is so ow.

428
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:24,039
Ow ow.

429
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,174
I'm sorry, there's a lot of crunchy candies involved

430
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:27,304
And like I don't expect that.

431
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:29,267
It's so nice, like fluffy, slimy

432
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:31,520
and you bite into a candy and it's like. (imitates cracking)

433
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,692
Ah.

434
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,525
It'll attack you bro

435
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:34,740
I wish you could taste it right now.

436
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,724
It's like all the best candies mixed into one.

437
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:40,023
My mouth is glued.

438
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:41,856
I can't, I can't talk.

439
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:45,235
Now we are moving on to the final one

440
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:48,064
which is the sour slime.

441
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:49,857
(chattering)

442
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:52,722
Now this looks like slime.

443
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:53,792
These Gummie Bears melted

444
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,537
and this literally looks like sour slime

445
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:57,602
without even adding any sour candy to it.

446
00:11:57,602 --> 00:12:00,022
And the process of making this into slime is gonna be

447
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:00,855
a little bit different this time

448
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:02,552
because we're still gonna use cornstarch

449
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:04,644
but instead of the powdered sugar,

450
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:06,378
we're gonna be using malic acid,

451
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:08,078
which is the sourest thing ever.

452
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,126
This is the stuff they put on sour candy.

453
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:12,300
This is, hands down, the worse.

454
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,503
So, again, we'll kick it off with the cornstarch right here,

455
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:16,971
And now comes the fun part, adding in

456
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,108
some malic acid.

457
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:18,941
Oh, my gosh.

458
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:20,171
I get chills

459
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,480
just from thinking about how bad this stuff is.

460
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,391
I've had some terrible, terrible experiences with it.

461
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:27,724
(screaming)

462
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:31,587
Alright.

463
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:32,659
Let's mix it up.

464
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:35,159
(light music)

465
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:47,338
And it's back in my hands.

466
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:48,383
I've got a tonne of cornstarch

467
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:50,311
but this stuff is still super sticky.

468
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,867
So I was saying out of all them so far

469
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:53,195
this is like the hardest one

470
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:54,554
to get to the right consistency.

471
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:56,866
I think it's because we used the malic acid on it.

472
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,532
But hopefully this will turn out.

473
00:12:58,532 --> 00:13:00,561
But at the moment it's just

474
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:01,477
it's crumbling.

475
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:03,493
Malic acid, man, always ruining everything,

476
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,244
across the board, twenty-four-seven.

477
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,859
(screaming)

478
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:08,484
Well that's kinda cool.

479
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:09,317
(blowing)

480
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:10,150
(laughing)

481
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,291
This stuff looked like the most slimy stuff

482
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,299
out of all of it.

483
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,612
Like this, it looks kinda toxic in a way.

484
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:15,445
Ya know what I mean?

485
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:16,499
I've created a bowl with it

486
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,368
and now it's time to add all the sour candience.

487
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:19,524
Of course we're kicking it off

488
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:20,869
with some toxic waste right here.

489
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,551
I gotta add two more of these ones,

490
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,388
as you guys know are intense.

491
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,638
Gotta pour some Cry Babies.

492
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:28,655
Personal favorite.

493
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:29,945
There we go, a couple of Sour Dots.

494
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:31,460
I'm not looking forward to biting into this.

495
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,085
And then we also have some sour Warhead spray.

496
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:36,841
My fingers are stuck together, this is so hard.

497
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:38,352
Oh, no.

498
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:39,653
No, no, no, no, no, okay,

499
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,486
Alright, here we go.

500
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,736
(coughing)

501
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:46,751
I breathed in some of that mist from the sour spray, man.

502
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:47,584
That went down the wrong way.

503
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:50,750
Okay, we're gonna take this and close it up.

504
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,989
Hoo.

505
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:52,822
Oh, no.

506
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,611
This stuff is going to be so, so intense.

507
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,846
I am not looking forward to biting this.

508
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:00,883
Oh my gosh, look

509
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:01,968
It's not even like sticking into it, man.

510
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:03,059
This stuff's so sour

511
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,409
It's like, we will not become part of the slime.

512
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,221
Here we go, I'm about to take a bite into

513
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,388
the sourest slime in the world,

514
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,868
but first, if you want to be featured

515
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:09,870
in the next video,

516
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,993
comment down below

517
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:12,392
How many pounds of slime

518
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:14,281
should I fill a pool with.

519
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:17,103
Also, congratulations to the keyper of the week, Claudia.

520
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,133
If you want to be keyper of the week

521
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,062
check the description down below to find out how.

522
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:23,372
You wanna see me eat the sourest slime in the world,

523
00:14:23,372 --> 00:14:25,539
here we go, three two one.

524
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:27,896
Ooh!

525
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:31,364
It looks like a little like a little like a hammock.

526
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:32,553
Dude, it looks like a little hammock.

527
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:34,219
Ha, That's so cool.

528
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:35,052
You (clears throat)

529
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,070
You challenge me to make soup.

530
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,649
Nope.

531
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:39,989
(laughing)

532
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:40,822
(coughing)
