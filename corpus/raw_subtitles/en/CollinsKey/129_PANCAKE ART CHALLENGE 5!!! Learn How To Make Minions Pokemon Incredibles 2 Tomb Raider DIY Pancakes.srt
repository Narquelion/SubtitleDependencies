1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
- No, no, no, no, no! Yipe!

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,333
(crash)

3
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:03,166
YouTube Challenge!

4
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,988
Wengie and I do the pancake art challenge!

5
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:06,568
- This is so squishy!

6
00:00:06,568 --> 00:00:07,980
- And we're kicking it off with Jack Jack

7
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,991
from "The Incredibles"!

8
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:10,310
Alright, so I'm gonna start with the body, here.

9
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,872
- It's so complicated!

10
00:00:11,872 --> 00:00:13,339
- [Collins] Okay, I'm gonna go here. We got another arm.

11
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:14,574
Oh! No, no, no, no, no!

12
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:15,646
- What is that??

13
00:00:15,646 --> 00:00:17,074
- He's got a giant leg!

14
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:18,256
- [Wengie] It looks like a cherry!

15
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:19,538
This is so hard!

16
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:20,371
What is happening?!

17
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,501
Now it looks like Santa.

18
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:22,334
(bells ringing)

19
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:23,167
- Oh, no!

20
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:25,605
(screaming)

21
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:26,621
It just squirted-- Stop it!

22
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:28,710
I feel like these pancakes just try to sabotage me at

23
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,559
every turn they get.

24
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,204
- Am I the only one taking this seriously here?

25
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:32,037
- What?!

26
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:34,337
This mask is taking up so much room!

27
00:00:34,337 --> 00:00:37,018
- Oh my god, there's no space for his legs!

28
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:39,050
- Oh, oh, oh! Collins has great ideas.

29
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,475
You're gonna take the legs and put them overhead

30
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:41,618
like he's doing a--

31
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:43,476
- You know how babies put their legs over their heads

32
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,419
and they're like, "Whee!" Like that?

33
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:47,210
- Nah, no. It's just tryin' to sabotage me.

34
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,043
I'm not gonna listen to him.

35
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:49,938
(lively music)

36
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:51,118
- [Collins] He has a green mouth,

37
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,406
and there's green comin' down

38
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:55,285
because little Baby Jack Jack just vomited all over himself.

39
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:57,481
He's like, (retches) So that's his mouth!

40
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,138
(lively music)

41
00:00:59,138 --> 00:00:59,971
(dramatic sting)

42
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:02,059
My favorite part of Jack Jack, the little hair on top,

43
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:03,249
I forgot all about it!

44
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:04,938
- [Wengie] You can't fit it!

45
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:07,322
- Oop, there's a way. Let's give Jack Jack some fingers.

46
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:09,458
I'm only giving him two fingers. That's all he needs.

47
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,848
- [Wengie] Now he looks like a crab!

48
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:11,789
(laughs)

49
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:12,622
- "I'm incredible!"

50
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:14,636
I got a pointy little spike of hair on his foot,

51
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:16,942
this was one toe hair the dude's been really growing out.

52
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:18,026
And there it is.

53
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:20,030
Ladies first, would you like to flip yours first?

54
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,598
- Sure. Hey! He's not sticking.

55
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:22,639
- Oh, snap! No, no, no, no, no!

56
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:23,505
(anxious noise)

57
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:24,338
- [Wengie] Wait--

58
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:25,449
(yells)

59
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:26,401
His head came off!

60
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,234
- His head popped off!

61
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:28,600
- I'm sorry, Jack Jack!

62
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,371
- Three, two, one!

63
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:32,621
(cheering)

64
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,221
- You're kidding me!

65
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,239
- [Wengie] Oh, if I could just move his foot a little bit

66
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,372
then, maybe, like a little-- Yeah. There's another foot.

67
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:40,205
But look at this!

68
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:41,501
- It is so good!

69
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,972
- [Wengie] It's so cute!

70
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:44,460
I love you, Jack Jack. You're cute.

71
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,483
- Here we go. Three, two, one!

72
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,116
(disappointed yelling)

73
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:50,859
Oh whoa, he's not broken though!

74
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:52,784
(yelling)

75
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:54,007
Oh, man!

76
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:55,464
He got burned!

77
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:56,739
(laughs)

78
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:57,974
Oh man, he got toasted!

79
00:01:57,974 --> 00:01:59,004
- [Wengie] Wait, what is this?

80
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:00,647
- [Collins] It's a little crab Jack Jack, right?

81
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:01,735
He's like, "What's up, Wengie, how you doin'?"

82
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:04,260
So you get to comment down below who won this round.

83
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,728
We'll be eating these pancakes at the end of the challenge,

84
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,247
and right now, the battle continues.

85
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:09,982
For this round, you challenged Wengie and I

86
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:11,936
to create our own minions.

87
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:13,037
- We don't get a picture?

88
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:14,884
But I haven't done a minion before!

89
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,717
- I have!

90
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:16,739
(laughs)

91
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:17,689
- What do minions look like?

92
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:18,522
- Begin!

93
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:20,840
- [Wengie] The eyeball-- They have eyeballs, right?

94
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,673
- I don't know.

95
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:22,955
Base of the minion, completed.

96
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:24,679
- I don't even know what that is!

97
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,730
(lively music)

98
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,577
- [Collins] Now this is really turning into Spongebob.

99
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:30,475
That's for sure.

100
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:31,683
- Oh, no!

101
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:33,727
The yellow just pushed my mouth away.

102
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:35,352
See? There's bits of mouth.

103
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:36,720
- You can just see kinda like this--

104
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,769
(oozing sound effect)

105
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,510
(lively music)

106
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,567
- Wait. Do they have arms?

107
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:42,520
They have arms, right?

108
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,371
- I don't know.

109
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,350
- [Wengie] Yeah, I'm gonna give it arms.

110
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,684
It's coming out of its face.

111
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:46,517
(laughs)

112
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:47,856
No, these feet will grow!

113
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:49,327
(sad music)

114
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:50,386
I have no reference!

115
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:51,713
- [Collins] I tried to give him hair,

116
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,036
but it didn't turn out right.

117
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:53,869
Yo!

118
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:55,498
My custom minion is jacked!

119
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,110
Look at that bicep development!

120
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,119
- Is it a bicep?

121
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:00,323
- No, that's his shoulder!

122
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:01,991
And then there's the arm.

123
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:02,916
(laughs)

124
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,700
And then, on this side, he doesn't work out his other arm.

125
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,533
There we go. Boom!

126
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,664
I am super excited because this time

127
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:10,864
I really think I'm about to take this round.

128
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:11,697
- Nope.

129
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:13,560
- Alright, here we go! Three, two--

130
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,854
Wait, wait, wait, first, five second subscribe challenge

131
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:17,831
we want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

132
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,509
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

133
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,350
Five,

134
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,191
four,

135
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:24,099
three,

136
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:24,966
two,

137
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:26,084
one!

138
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:26,917
Done!

139
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,223
If you can do that, comment below "Keyper Squad" right now.

140
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:30,672
My spatula can't go all the way under!

141
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:31,659
- [Wengie] Yeah, he's a bit tall.

142
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:32,832
(yells of disappointment)

143
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:35,162
- [Collins] The mini-hand, it got broken off!

144
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:36,579
Three, two, one--

145
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,967
(cheering)

146
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:40,800
(crash)

147
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,497
Oh, that was really loud.

148
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:44,852
Let us know in the comments below who won this round.

149
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:48,101
And the battle heats up, and we're on to the next round

150
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,223
For this round, you challenged us to make Pikachu

151
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:51,639
from Pokemon Go!

152
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,690
(lively music)

153
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,980
- [Wengie] Your Pikachu is, like, stretched.

154
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,813
(weird noises)

155
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:58,646
(sneeze)

156
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:00,142
- So I'm gonna make a creative decision, here.

157
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:02,038
Not at all fueled by the fact that we're running out of

158
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:03,570
the color yellow, and I think I'm gonna need it

159
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,050
for an upcoming round, but I'm gonna go purple.

160
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,900
- A purple Pikachu.

161
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,733
The reasoning behind it,

162
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,895
Pikachu has been holding his breath for a long time.

163
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:12,447
He's underwater, so he's having a bit of trouble breathing.

164
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,793
Now it's time to turn on my griddle and roast my Pikachu.

165
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:16,033
Get him heated up, and get him spicy!

166
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,004
- This wasn't a speed round, by the way.

167
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,554
You didn't have to rush it.

168
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:20,822
- Oh, I didn't rush. This was it!

169
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:21,655
It's time for the flip.

170
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:23,346
I think I'll flip my masterpiece first,

171
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,583
and then we'll flip your mediocre, at-best, pancake.

172
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,416
- No way!

173
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,885
That looks like a purple koala.

174
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:33,425
- [Collins] Here we go. Three, two, one--

175
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:35,031
(cheering)

176
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:35,864
Yes!

177
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:36,855
- [Wengie] What's with those eyes?

178
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:38,957
- [Collins] Those eyes are the best!

179
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:40,489
- [Wengie] That looks like Pikachu in the dark

180
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,618
with glowing eyes.

181
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,689
- And he's buggin' eyes like, "Oh my god, get me some air!"

182
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,522
- Okay, ready?

183
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:46,491
Three, two, one--

184
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:47,932
Pikachu!

185
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:48,772
- How?!

186
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:51,331
Even the hands and the little feet and the--

187
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:52,807
Look at his little feet!

188
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:55,690
Like, I don't wanna eat that pancake. That's just adorable.

189
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,919
So, again, comment down below who you think won this round.

190
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,304
- Okay, for this round I think we should do Hello Kitty.

191
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:03,087
- No, we're not doing Hello Kitty, no.

192
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:03,920
- So cute!

193
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,753
- Fine!

194
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:06,916
We'll do a flash challenge, speed round of Hello Kitty.

195
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:07,749
Go!

196
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:09,747
(fast-forward sound effect)

197
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,858
- Luckily I've drawn a lot of Hello Kittys in my life.

198
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:12,941
- I've drawn zero Hello Kittys!

199
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:13,774
This is my very first!

200
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:16,021
(fast-forward sound effect)

201
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:17,144
Holy cow!

202
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:18,611
Holy cow, holy cow, holy cow, okay!

203
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,379
- [Wengie] My Hello Kitty practice is coming in handy!

204
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:21,212
- What- Are you almost--

205
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:23,478
(screams)

206
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:27,277
(fast-forward sound effect)

207
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:28,198
- Why is this not coming--

208
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:29,184
(screams)

209
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:32,617
(fast-forward sound effect)

210
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:33,501
- Done!

211
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,002
That's what evil Hello Kitty would look like.

212
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,525
- Alright, here we go, guys. The moment of truth.

213
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:38,908
Let's see if I can get it underneath, yo.

214
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,229
It's starting to crack a little bit--

215
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:41,180
(screams)

216
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,997
Hello Kitty is about to be Goodbye Kitty.

217
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,914
Okay, here we go. Three, two, one--

218
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:48,376
(cheering)

219
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:49,233
What is that?!

220
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,204
- [Wengie] Can we even call that a face?

221
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:52,179
- Ya cannot.

222
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:54,540
- [Wengie] No, I always get them breaking-

223
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,411
- Alright, the suspense is building. Here we go.

224
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:57,828
Three, two, one--

225
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,624
(cheering)

226
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:02,295
- She wasn't as good as I thought she'd be.

227
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,128
- Are you kidding?!

228
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:06,477
"She wasn't as good as I thought she'd-" Compared to-

229
00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:07,802
It tore in half!

230
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:10,154
I am blown away. So, you get to comment down below

231
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:12,243
who won this round.

232
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:13,547
- How are we gonna eat them later?

233
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:14,530
Why are you throwing them on the floor?

234
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,678
- Oh, yeah--

235
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:18,327
Now this round is crucial, I need to win it.

236
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,380
And for this one we are doing the Hulk.

237
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,783
- The Hulk? It's so difficult!

238
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:23,004
How many packs does he have?

239
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:24,022
Like, eight packs?

240
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:25,488
- Yeah, he has an eight pack of muscles, he's got biceps,

241
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:26,738
triceps, delts-

242
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,919
So, right now, let's make the most jacked superhero

243
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,523
of all time. And begin!

244
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:33,068
- I'm gonna go sideways. He's a bit tall.

245
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:35,032
He's got such a little head for his body.

246
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,482
And then, his shoulders are so big that he doesn't

247
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,425
have a neck.

248
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:39,855
Okay, now I can't fit his arms.

249
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:41,721
- Now time for the Hulk's legs and feet,

250
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,553
'Cause they're kinda the same thing- Oh, no!

251
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,700
(lively music)

252
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,760
See, the thing about the Hulk is that

253
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,375
he's achieved what no other human can.

254
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,592
He has achieved the completely square physique.

255
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:51,588
He looks like a box!

256
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:54,196
(lively music)

257
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:57,340
- And again, my pancake is stuck!

258
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,204
- Oh!

259
00:06:58,204 --> 00:06:59,615
- This is not going well for me.

260
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:02,820
I was gonna draw his face, and now he has no face.

261
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,653
- Perfect!

262
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:05,916
I really think that the Hulk from the new Avengers movie

263
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,354
is gonna look just like this.

264
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:08,924
And, if it doesn't, I will be shocked.

265
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:10,940
I think this is a perfect scale model for what

266
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,773
it should look like.

267
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:12,832
How crazy would that be?

268
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,187
If the Hulk could flip himself?

269
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:15,054
Using the muscles like,

270
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:15,977
(roaring noise)

271
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,810
Okay, here we go.

272
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,956
- [Wengie] Here we go!

273
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:19,456
- Three, two, one-

274
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,668
(disappointed screaming)

275
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:22,501
No, no, no, no, no!

276
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,709
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

277
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,675
- {Wengie] That's what happens when you skip leg day.

278
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:27,033
- Holy cow!

279
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,345
- [Wengie] He has a cute face, though.

280
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:29,298
- [Collins] Thank you!

281
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:30,731
His face is super cute, man.

282
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:33,289
- [Wengie] Ready? I'm gonna flip it. Three, two-

283
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,122
- Wait, wait, wait!

284
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:36,497
First, 3 second like challenge. We wanna see if you can

285
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,115
like this video, and give it a thumbs up,

286
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:39,109
in three seconds. Ready?

287
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:39,942
Here we go.

288
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:40,900
Three,

289
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,733
two,

290
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:42,566
one-

291
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:43,399
Done!

292
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,232
Alright, so let's see how this thing looks.

293
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,065
- Aright, ready?

294
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,328
And-

295
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:49,140
(disappointed screaming)

296
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,973
No!

297
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:51,676
- [Collins] He doesn't have a face!

298
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:53,933
He fell and he doesn't have a face!

299
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:54,766
- Do you need help?

300
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,888
(screaming)

301
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:57,017
- You broke my Hulk!

302
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:57,850
- What?!

303
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,433
It was already broken!

304
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,170
- [Wengie] You know, my favorite part, was his six pack,

305
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,847
and now it's a split pack!

306
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:04,646
I think we can save him.

307
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:05,479
- Nope!

308
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:06,747
So, this round is a real toss-up.

309
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:07,622
Yipe!

310
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:08,455
(crash)

311
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,217
And you're the only one who can decide who won

312
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:12,572
so comment down below who won this round.

313
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:13,590
Sixty second flash challenge!

314
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,052
We're coming into the finale right now.

315
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:16,513
We're making Finding Nemo. Go!

316
00:08:16,513 --> 00:08:19,782
(fast-forward sound effect)

317
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:20,990
He's got, like, white stripes so-

318
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,082
(laser noise)

319
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:23,106
That's a stripe.

320
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,208
(laser noise)

321
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,041
That's a stripe!

322
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,938
(fast-forward noise)

323
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,294
Whoa, there we go, his mouth is like,

324
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:29,553
(gasping noise)

325
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:31,250
Oh, wait a minute, I got pink everywhere!

326
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,083
Here we go!

327
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,743
(fast-forward sound effect)

328
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,521
(yelling)

329
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:36,426
Done!

330
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:39,105
Holy cow, I am not good at flash challenges.

331
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:40,787
For this one let's do ladies first.

332
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,620
- [Wengie] Ready?

333
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,453
- [Collins] Yup!

334
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:44,025
- [Wengie] Three, two, one-

335
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,599
(laughing)

336
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,913
- [Collins] Oh my god!

337
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:49,277
It looks like Nemo got hit in the eye

338
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:52,005
like he hit some coral reef on his way to try to find

339
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:52,838
something, man.

340
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:54,170
My guy, oh, he's already broken.

341
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,887
Okay, here we go. Three, two, one-

342
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:58,641
(laughter)

343
00:08:58,641 --> 00:08:59,837
- [Wengie] Why does he have three eyeballs?

344
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:01,227
- So he can see three times as much.

345
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:02,702
So you guys get to comment, down below,

346
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:04,241
who won the speed round.

347
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:07,081
- [Wengie] Alright, for this round, I thought we could do

348
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,030
our face!

349
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,170
- Okay, just make our face?

350
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,003
- No, no, no!

351
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:11,744
You're gonna do my face, and I'm gonna do your face.

352
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:12,664
- Oh!

353
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:14,572
I am apologizing in advance.

354
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:16,593
- Alright, so, your face. Could you look at me for a sec?

355
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:18,075
- Okay, here is my face.

356
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:19,162
- Okay, it's just a blob, I think.

357
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:20,482
- Okay, look at me for a second.

358
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:21,315
Gotcha. Okay!

359
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:22,678
- I'm gonna go with the blue eyes.

360
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:23,561
You can't skip the blue eyes.

361
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:24,394
- You can't skip 'em!

362
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:25,861
- [Wengie] You got some straight brows.

363
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:27,108
So, I'm gonna go with the straight brows.

364
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,182
My makeup skills are coming in handy, here.

365
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:31,288
(lively music)

366
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:34,136
I've realized this is the worst pancake that I've made-

367
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:34,969
(wheezing noise)

368
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:35,975
What is that?!

369
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,272
(lively music)

370
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:41,068
- Man, this is not good. I need help!

371
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:43,036
I'm summoning the Devin, the Devan Force.

372
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:44,300
Devan, come here!

373
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,133
- [Devan] I'm coming!

374
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,356
- Alright, let me see. Hold on, hold on, hold on-

375
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:48,452
Nope. There's nothing you can do to help that.

376
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:50,003
There's nothing you can do!

377
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:52,005
- Well, I think if I can nail one thing, it'll be the hair.

378
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,803
So now, next step, is the pink. And then purple, at the end.

379
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:55,745
- I look like a witch.

380
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:58,005
(lively music)

381
00:09:58,005 --> 00:09:59,820
- I just want to say, you suggested this round.

382
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,662
That's all I'm gonna say.

383
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:02,752
Let's see how my face turned out.

384
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:04,139
(cheering)

385
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,445
Well done!

386
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:06,812
- Does that look like Collins, guys?

387
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:07,934
- [Collins] You nailed it!

388
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:09,075
It's uncanny, the resemblance.

389
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:09,908
Wha-?

390
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:10,741
I would like to let you know

391
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,300
that this has nothing to do with the way that I

392
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,158
actually see you.

393
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:14,995
Besides the fact that I am terrible at art!

394
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:17,243
- Oh gosh, I don't even know if I want to see this.

395
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:18,802
Maybe I should just cover my eyes.

396
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:20,299
- Yeah, you might want to brace yourself.

397
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:21,516
- [Wengie] Oh no, don't break her!

398
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:23,016
- Three, two, one-

399
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,114
(laughter and shouting)

400
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:28,517
It's beautiful!

401
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:31,957
- I'm normally very nice to people, but, right now,

402
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:32,790
meditation!

403
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,902
- I somehow made the sweetest face in the entire world

404
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,751
but truly terrifying.

405
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:40,941
Comment down below who you think won this round,

406
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,227
and the finale is coming up,

407
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:43,879
then we're gonna eat all these pancakes.

408
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,433
For the final round, the one it all comes down to,

409
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:47,453
it's a freestyle.

410
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:48,950
We get to create whatever we want.

411
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,206
- What? What do you mean?

412
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:51,039
Like, whatever?

413
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:51,872
- Whatever!

414
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:52,705
- Whatever!

415
00:10:52,705 --> 00:10:54,062
Here we go, three, two, one- Go!

416
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:56,347
Oh my gosh, what are you doing?!

417
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:57,903
- This is payback for the last time

418
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:00,524
you pranked me on your channel!

419
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:02,479
- I'm the freestyle in this whole round. Great!

420
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,709
- Now we're gonna put you on the griddle!

421
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:04,542
- No!

422
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:05,833
That this is super hot, right now!

423
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,363
So guys, I was gonna make Lara Croft

424
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:09,305
from the new Tomb Raider movie- So how about this?

425
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:10,827
You've already turned me into an art project

426
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:13,348
lets both make Lara Croft, together, for the final one.

427
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:15,837
Imagine we split here in half. I'll make the right half,

428
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:16,710
and you make the left half.

429
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,059
Okay, here we go. Half of the shirt.

430
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:19,106
And then, of course, we need to get-

431
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:20,343
she's got, like, cool shorts on.

432
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:22,922
So we need to give her some cool shorts.

433
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:24,914
(lively music)

434
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:25,747
She got big feet.

435
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:27,462
It's very important about the character, big feet.

436
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:29,177
It's how she gets around the jungle so quickly,

437
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:30,337
how she raids tombs,

438
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:31,768
'cause that's what she does.

439
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:33,141
- [Wengie] Alright, I'm doing foot.

440
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:34,527
Our feet are different lengths!

441
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,588
- [Collins] Oh no!

442
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:37,726
And remember, with the face, it's half and half.

443
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:39,616
- Oh no, how do you draw half a face?!

444
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,199
(lively music)

445
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,814
- [Collins] Time to flip part one of Lara Croft!

446
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:48,490
Let's see if this works, here we go.

447
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,323
- Oh, god!

448
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:51,406
- Oh no, three, two, one-

449
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:55,549
(yelling)

450
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,224
There we go, part one is done.

451
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:58,205
- She looks interesting.

452
00:11:58,205 --> 00:11:59,038
- She looks--

453
00:11:59,038 --> 00:11:59,954
(awkward noise)

454
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:02,281
Hopefully your side will make up for whatever is going on

455
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,114
on my side.

456
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:05,523
- We're gonna go with the other half.

457
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:06,356
Oh, no!

458
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,189
- [Collins] You're taking off her hair!

459
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:08,022
- [Wengie] Sorry, sorry!

460
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:08,938
My bad!

461
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:09,944
Oh no!

462
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:10,777
Her arm!

463
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:12,065
- Her arm is just so long.

464
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,782
Okay, here we go, three, two, one-

465
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:16,297
(yelling)

466
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:18,392
Teamwork makes the dream work, baby!

467
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:19,448
Let's line it up, okay?

468
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,851
So let's just move it down a little bit.

469
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:23,024
- She don't look half bad!

470
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:23,857
(ding)

471
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:26,138
- We just did a full Lara Croft!

472
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:28,653
So guys, now it's time to eat our pancakes!

473
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:30,304
And guys, make sure you check out the video we did

Actually, guys, click over here, right now, to watch it.

478
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:41,029
But let's see how these things taste. We got this one.

479
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:41,862
(munching sound effect)

480
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:42,811
- They're good. Me and mine taste good.

481
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:43,644
We got this one.

482
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:44,981
(munching sound effect)

483
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:48,706
And we also got this- We got the minion!

484
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:49,547
Alright, love you guys!

485
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:50,700
Take a look at Wengie's video!

486
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,533
- Love you!

487
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:52,547
- Love you, bye!
