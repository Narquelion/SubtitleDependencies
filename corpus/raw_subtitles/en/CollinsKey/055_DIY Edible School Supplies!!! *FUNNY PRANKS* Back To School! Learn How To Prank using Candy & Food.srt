1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,173
- Mm.

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:03,006
- What?

3
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:03,974
- They're edible candy crayons.

4
00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:05,083
- Dude, that's awesome.

5
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,660
- Yeah, they're really good.

6
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,812
Wait, bro, that's a real one.

7
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:09,741
Dude, what are you doing?

8
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:10,574
(yells)

9
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:11,574
Spit it out.

10
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:14,977
Why would you do that?

11
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:17,106
- It doesn't even taste good, it doesn't taste good at all.

12
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:18,514
You challenged us to make a whole bunch

13
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:20,783
of DIY edible back to school supplies.

14
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:22,871
That way, when you get hungry in class, you can eat.

15
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:23,704
There are two ways

16
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:24,596
to make candy crayons.

17
00:00:24,596 --> 00:00:25,745
One involves Skittles.

18
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:26,793
- The other fondant.

19
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,710
- Step one, you gotta open the bag.

20
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:35,744
- Woah, bro (laughs), bro, what did you do?

21
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,812
- [Collins] (laughs) I don't even know.

22
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:38,481
Hey, at least I got two of 'em in there.

23
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:39,551
- [Devan] Nice, okay.

24
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:41,407
- I think I have one in my hair.

25
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:42,868
- Wait, I wanna check.

26
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:43,735
(laughs loudly)

27
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,692
I think there's one in my shirt, too.

28
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:47,022
- Oh, on the back of your shirt (laughs).

29
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:47,961
- Yep, there it was.

30
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:50,064
- Step two, gonna separate out the colors of my Skittles.

31
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:51,861
- And I'm gonna start cutting this fondant

32
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,103
into crayon shapes.

33
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:54,094
- Let's do it.

34
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:57,427
(whimsical piano music)

35
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:00,500
(Skittles clicking)

36
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,959
- Woah, woah, woah, what are you doing?

37
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,290
- Well, I had to divide 'em into only the red ones.

38
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,123
- Oh.

39
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:07,170
- [Audience] Oh!

40
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,476
- Next up, gonna melt these down

41
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:09,701
and then turn it into a crayon.

42
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:11,915
Now, I'm just gonna try to poke 'em and see if they break.

43
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:13,005
Oh. - Wow,

44
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:14,352
that looks so cool!

45
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:15,795
- They look like little flowers or something.

46
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:17,171
So now we're gonna peel these off.

47
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,023
What are you doing?

48
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:18,856
- [Devan] I'm rolling it.

49
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:19,689
- Look like a little DJ, like,

50
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:20,522
(record scratching)

51
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:21,355
Now I'm gonna take these

52
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:23,346
and then I'm gonna turn these into a crayon.

53
00:01:23,346 --> 00:01:25,054
That looks like, not enough for a crayon.

54
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:26,238
- That does not look like enough.

55
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:27,330
- Like, in comparison to this,

56
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,509
I dunno how that's gonna work.

57
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:29,367
Ooh, dude, yeah, - You're pushing it.

58
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:30,464
- This is actually gonna work!

59
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:31,596
- Whoa, it's actually working.

60
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:32,429
- Oh my gosh.

61
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:34,304
Now I'm gonna kinda like, turn this into a point here.

62
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:35,672
I've made a crayon.

63
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:38,002
It's like the pointiest crayon of all time, bro.

64
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:40,327
You will get some fine defined lines with it.

65
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:41,160
Ta-da!

66
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,398
I made a crayon you can eat!

67
00:01:42,398 --> 00:01:44,427
- Man, did you just grab one of my wrappers.

68
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:45,335
Seriously?

69
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:47,823
- Yeah, but I want to see what color crayon you made.

70
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:49,946
Bro, did you really have to make like five different colors?

71
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:52,009
- I mean, uh, yours took a long time.

72
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,293
- You ready, we're gonna eat 'em, here we go.

73
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:54,126
Three,

74
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,937
- [Both] two, one.

75
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:57,436
- No, wait, wait, wait, first I've got a challenge.

76
00:01:57,436 --> 00:01:59,575
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel,

77
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:01,494
turn on the channel post notifications

78
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:03,905
and give this video a thumbs up in seven seconds.

79
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:04,738
Here we go, you ready for it?

80
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:05,571
- I'm ready.

81
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:06,404
- Seven,

82
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:10,571
- [Both] six, five, four, three, two, one (laugh)

83
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,513
- Time.

84
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:14,503
If you can do that, comment down below,

85
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:17,117
Keyper Squad, right now, what are you doing?

86
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,331
- (laughs) I forgot how to count on my fingers for a second.

87
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:21,186
- And this is a back to school video, Devan.

88
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:22,019
Here we go.

89
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:22,886
- Alright.

90
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,563
Wait, what, you actually caught that?

91
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:25,645
Alright, here I go.

92
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,950
- Oh my God.

93
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,907
Oh. - Mmm.

94
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:30,301
- This is the greatest tasting crayon of all.

95
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,895
- Mm, this is so good.

96
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:32,728
- What's up, dudes?

97
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:37,453
My first day of school, man, how you doing? (laughs)

98
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:38,900
(spits)

99
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,277
You are about to learn how to make an edible glue stick,

100
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:42,110
so, - Yep.

101
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,165
- There's gonna be two different versions of this.

102
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:45,359
Version number one is gonna be with the frosting.

103
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:47,138
- And the other one is gonna be with Starburst.

104
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:49,131
- Step one, you need to dismantle your glue stick.

105
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,045
- You just have to remove the glue from the glue stick.

106
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:51,946
- I like the way the word dismantle more.

107
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:52,918
Just twist your glue stick a lot

108
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:54,307
and then just, whee. - I dunno if this,

109
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,674
I can't tell if this part was supposed to be (laughs),

110
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:57,507
did you throw it?

111
00:02:57,507 --> 00:02:58,340
- No.

112
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,267
Alright, next step, you're gonna wash out your glue stick.

113
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:01,513
And we're back.

114
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:04,307
- Next up, I'm gonna start unwrapping my Starburst.

115
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:05,140
What are you doing?

116
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,261
- I'm about to open this up with one finger.

117
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:07,094
- Oh!

118
00:03:07,094 --> 00:03:08,441
- Aw, man.

119
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,550
- Oh!

120
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,176
First step for me is punching this Starburst

121
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:13,129
into this tube.

122
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,707
Three, two, one.

123
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:15,821
(yells)

124
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,630
(groans)

125
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,275
You have no idea how hard this is.

126
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:20,533
Okay, I think I got it.

127
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,366
Nope.

128
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:25,382
- I'm about to fill myself with fro, I mean my (laughs),

129
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:26,811
Bro, I'm crying I'm laughing so hard right now,

130
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:27,644
this is not good.

131
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:29,285
- (groans) Oh, why is this not working?

132
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:30,716
- (groans) Sorry, bro, I'm messing up.

133
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:32,340
- Oh, no, that doesn't look like it's working.

134
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,737
Ooh, this technique is working.

135
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:34,941
This works really well.

136
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:35,774
- [Collins] Oh, you got it?

137
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:36,906
- Yeah, you just don't do it on the table,

138
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:38,052
'cause it gets stuck.

139
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,687
- A little bit of excess on the edge, so just,

140
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,520
- What?

141
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,353
- It's done!

142
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:43,186
While Devan's finishing his,

143
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:44,350
I'm gonna pop this in the freezer for a few minutes,

144
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,993
so, yeah, I'll be right back.

145
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:46,826
Whoa, jeez.

146
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:47,659
- Did you almost fall?

147
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:48,492
- Yep.

148
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:49,593
Bam, got mine out the freezer.

149
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:50,426
Yo! - Whoa!

150
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:52,834
Look at that!

151
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,149
- [Collins] Oh my gosh.

152
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:55,626
- That's so awesome.

153
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,671
- See, the thing is, mine actually looks like a glue stick,

154
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,341
so in class, I wouldn't get in trouble.

155
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:00,348
But Devan, on the other hand,

156
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:01,660
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.

157
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,289
- This was suggested by the Instagram Keyper of the Week--

158
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,406
- Oh no!

159
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:05,239
Oh no! - What was that?

160
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,072
So if you want a big shot

161
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:06,905
to be Instagram Keyper of the Week,

162
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,649
check the description down below to find out how.

163
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,015
But right now, Devan, grab your glue stick,

164
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:10,921
- I have to find it.

165
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:12,303
I think I broke the five-second rule.

166
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:13,648
- Three,

167
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:15,770
- [Both] two, one.

168
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,338
- I'm just gonna glue my paper over here.

169
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:19,171
(sputters)

170
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:20,073
(laughs) - Mm.

171
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:21,179
- Oh my gosh.

172
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,012
- So good.

173
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,133
(mumbles)

174
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,124
- You said, what was that?

175
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:26,681
I'm sorry, I can't understand you, what?

176
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:27,514
- This is a lot of frosting.

177
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:28,790
- Huh?

178
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,329
I think you're saying we're moving on to the next one?

179
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:32,162
Got it.

180
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:32,995
- Now, you could prank everyone

181
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:34,988
with this next DIY edible food,

182
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:38,272
right, what, oh, dude, this is so cool.

183
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:39,105
- I know, right?

184
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:40,375
- I've always wanted to eat this.

185
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,489
It's so powdery.

186
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,099
It's so delicious-looking, bro.

187
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,802
- Mm, I think I did way too much.

188
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:48,359
- I wonder how many of these I can fit in my mouth.

189
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,192
- No!

190
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:50,025
- Mm-hmm.

191
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:53,983
I've seen this on every Instagram not satisfied compilation.

192
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:55,234
- Whoa.

193
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:57,581
(slurps)

194
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,581
(gasps)

195
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,222
- It's my tongue.

196
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:03,215
(spits)

197
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:06,658
You literally just spit all over me, Devan.

198
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:07,875
- It wasn't on purpose.

199
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,818
- Well, ya did it!

200
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:10,386
Fun bonus, ow, life hack,

201
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,363
is that if you wanna get super muscular cheeks,

202
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:13,324
which I'm not saying you do,

203
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:14,927
But if you do, this is what you do.

204
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:16,577
Grab yourself one of these long balloons,

205
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:17,410
- Okay.

206
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,243
- and then try to blow it up.

207
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:20,697
So Devan, go for it.

208
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,058
It's actually really difficult,

209
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:23,795
like it's, - I'm literally trying

210
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:24,628
as hard as I can.

211
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:25,744
- But if you keep practicing every day,

212
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:28,133
someday, you'll be able to do this.

213
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,740
- What?

214
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,573
Wait, how?

215
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,451
- Yeah, it's just extreme cheek muscles.

216
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:39,534
Don't pop it. - Oh, I tried to pop it.

217
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,623
Bye-bye, balloon.

218
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:42,456
Alright, so what you do

219
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:44,357
is you just take this little part here,

220
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:45,792
and you just wrap it around.

221
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:46,625
You good there?

222
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,458
- I'm so good.

223
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,483
- What are you doing?

224
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:49,316
- I've got an idea.

225
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:53,341
Gonna roll it up and then toss it up, 'cause it's a gumball.

226
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:54,174
(gum thuds)

227
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:55,007
Ow.

228
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:55,840
Here we go.

229
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,673
- [Audience] Yay!

230
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:57,506
- Oh, nailed it.

231
00:05:57,506 --> 00:05:58,757
Right as I finished, too.

232
00:05:58,757 --> 00:05:59,908
You ready for this.

233
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:01,484
I'm pretty sure this goes this way.

234
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:02,452
Put it down in there.

235
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:04,725
Whoa, look at that.

236
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,140
I guess you just pull it from here,

237
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,473
and then you, ooh, that actually worked.

238
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:11,255
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:13,052
This is an awesome prank you can pull on your friends

240
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:14,036
when you go back to school.

241
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:18,645
Basically, if you take a glue container, you empty it out,

242
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,575
now you're gonna wanna go to the sink and wash it out,

243
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:23,427
because you want no glue left in here whatsoever.

244
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:24,478
Once you've emptied them out,

245
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:26,023
now it's time to fill them up with a liquid,

246
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:27,613
so Devan's got some water for his.

247
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:28,638
- Oh, this is going well.

248
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,557
- Oh, yeah, that was not smooth, Devan.

249
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,458
- Don't make me laugh.

250
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,266
- Alright, so I've got some milk for mine.

251
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:35,121
Look at that precision. - Ooh.

252
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:35,980
(slurps)

253
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,108
Alright, there you go.

254
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,778
- (coughs) I tasted the glue, bro.

255
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:40,547
Now that it's prepared, you're ready for the prank.

256
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:41,428
So here's how it works.

257
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:43,486
You're sitting in class chillin'

258
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,425
and you're a little bit thirsty.

259
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:45,588
Hey guys, any of you have any water?

260
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:46,421
No one's got water.

261
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:47,254
You're like, what?

262
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:48,365
And then you pick up your glue and you go like,

263
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:50,282
yo, peep this out, fam.

264
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,487
(splutters)

265
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:53,530
Not that aggressively.

266
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,291
- No, no, no, no, don't shoot it straight up.

267
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,970
No, that's not a good idea (laughs).

268
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,411
Now we're gonna make an eraser.

269
00:06:58,411 --> 00:06:59,409
- Wooh.

270
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,220
- No, no, no, no, I want it, bro, what are you doing?

271
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,316
No, no, no, I want it, wait, what?

272
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:04,149
- Again?

273
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,074
- Seriously?

274
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:07,571
- Well, I guess we're gonna grab out three red ones each.

275
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:08,404
There we go. - No, no, no,

276
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,083
the pink ones, we're making a pink eraser.

277
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,149
- Oh.

278
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,229
Just keep in mind, you're not a yellow Starburst.

279
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:14,062
- Mm-mm.

280
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:15,084
- You're a pink one.

281
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:17,361
This next part may sound very difficult,

282
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:18,592
and it probably will be,

283
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:19,846
but we're gonna try to make it easy.

284
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:20,679
You're gonna have to like,

285
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,716
meld three separate Starbursts into one.

286
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:23,549
How?

287
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:26,592
Where's our blowtorch when you really need it?

288
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:30,331
- Wait, no, no, no, no, no, you can't do that.

289
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,577
- Devan had the brilliant idea to first put it into a ball

290
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,966
and then, from there, mush it into the eraser shape.

291
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:37,228
- Ooh, this looks cool, it's like a marble ball.

292
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,291
- [Collins] Oh, that looks really neat.

293
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,432
- Alright, I feel like it's a bouncy ball, no!

294
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:42,561
- It's not bouncy.

295
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,096
I'm gonna try to stretch my Star, oh,

296
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,198
I'm breaking my Starburst.

297
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,766
- Alright, my eraser is, what is that for?

298
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:48,976
- I knew rulers had to come in handy

299
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:50,053
at some point in my life.

300
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,087
- It's just gonna get stuck.

301
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:52,380
You're gonna have two rulers stuck together.

302
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,292
- Shh.

303
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,125
- Sorry.

304
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:54,958
- I have a great idea.

305
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:55,791
Let's uh,

306
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,248
- You can start over?

307
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:58,081
Oh, okay.

308
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:00,494
So for this next part, I'm going to use an X-Acto knife.

309
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:02,216
- So for this part, make sure you have parental supervision

310
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,768
if you're doing this at home.

311
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:07,518
- (groans) That didn't work.

312
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:10,201
- I have a life hack, I have a life hack.

313
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,500
- No, no!

314
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,155
- I'm sorry, Devan, it had to be done,

315
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:15,848
and right now, we're moving on to the finale.

316
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:17,990
A notebook, let's do it.

317
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,458
This is the big finale.

318
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,851
It's an entirely edible notebook,

319
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,298
like every single thing is edible.

320
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:24,664
That way you can write notes to someone,

321
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:26,634
pass it to them, it's like, if the teacher calls you out,

322
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:27,699
you can literally just eat the note.

323
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,708
This right here is something called sugar sheet,

324
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,241
so it's like paper made out of entirely sugar.

325
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:34,085
Can you get the pens open?

326
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:34,918
- I got it.

327
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:36,596
- There are also pens that the ink is edible.

328
00:08:36,596 --> 00:08:38,619
I guess you can, like, decorate food with it and stuff.

329
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,536
- I wonder.

330
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:41,771
Don't bump me.

331
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,169
Don't, I see your hand.

332
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,089
Alright, I'm making one more red line right next to it.

333
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:49,550
- Jeez, these pages are gonna be looking so spicy, bro.

334
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,948
- Look at that! - Oh my gosh.

335
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,132
- Ooh, it looks so good.

336
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,542
- Alright, so next step is the lines,

337
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,198
so I have the black pen for you, so I'm gonna,

338
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:56,873
- No, no, no, they're blue.

339
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:58,053
It's a good thing I'm making this.

340
00:08:58,053 --> 00:08:59,443
- While he's doing that, I've got some Twizzlers

341
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:01,213
I was gonna deconstruct right now

342
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:03,705
and turn them into the book pages.

343
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:05,179
Yo, these are cool.

344
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,423
(whimsical piano music)

345
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:08,549
- You're not eating it, are you?

346
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,882
- Of course not.

347
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,594
Devan's gonna punch holes out of the pages

348
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:16,688
as I decorate the artwork on the front of it.

349
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:18,093
I know you're thinking I'm not an artist.

350
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:19,029
But I'm about to be.

351
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,655
- I cannot wait to see what this turns out like.

352
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:21,565
- Bro, it's gonna be legendary.

353
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:25,363
- I'm just realizing that I did this in the wrong order.

354
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:28,459
This stuff is supposed to be done at the same time

355
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,903
that we have the cover and all of the other pages,

356
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,685
or else none of the holes are gonna line up.

357
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:33,987
So, yeah.

358
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:35,501
- Before I reveal to you guys my masterpiece,

359
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:36,334
I just wanna let you guys know

360
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:37,167
that on a completely unrelated note,

361
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,084
I recently got stung by a bee on my finger,

362
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:40,524
which really hurt, and here's my cover.

363
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:41,357
- Wow.

364
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:42,999
- It's a giant foot, and it's a dude saying,

365
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,587
oh no, and he's like, it's a bee, and then there's a bee,

366
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,281
and then it's like, it's a foot, it's a foot,

367
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,138
and it's stinky.

368
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:50,847
- My favorite part is the foot is saying it's a foot.

369
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,510
- The bee's looking mad, dangerous, bro,

370
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,223
it's coming in hot with that stinger.

371
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:56,158
- But I think you nailed it, you did a really good job.

372
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:57,758
Okay, I'm gonna try to peel this off.

373
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:58,591
- Okay.

374
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:00,982
- Okay.

375
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:02,248
- It's so weirdly flexible.

376
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:04,788
- I know, it's like, paper.

377
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:06,818
- Think about that, man, rolling through the school year

378
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:07,923
with this all year,

379
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:10,827
you'll be the most popular kid, for sure.

380
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,366
- If you don't eat it before you get

381
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,199
to the end of the school year.

382
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:14,334
- I mean, 'cause it just, what's more delicious

383
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:17,654
than a bee about to sting, it's a foot.

384
00:10:17,654 --> 00:10:18,863
Oh, I nailed it! - Woah.

385
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:20,375
They're like sprinkles.

386
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,187
- [Collins] Alright, next step is the binding.

387
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:23,368
- I hope the pages don't crack.

388
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:27,077
- And here you have it, the coolest binder of all time,

389
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:28,724
'cause ya can eat it! - Wow.

390
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:29,557
