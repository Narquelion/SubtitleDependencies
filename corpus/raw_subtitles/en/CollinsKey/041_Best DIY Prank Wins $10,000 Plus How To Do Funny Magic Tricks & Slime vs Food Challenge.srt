1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:01,021
- I've got 5000.

2
00:00:01,021 --> 00:00:02,350
- I've got 5000.

3
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,925
- And whoever makes the best DIY prank wins $10,000,

4
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:07,719
right now, let's go!

5
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,944
New challenge you have to try the exploding milk jug prank.

6
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:11,355
Boom alright, milk carton's emptied out,

7
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:12,188
that's step number one.

8
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:13,598
Next step, got the balloon here so here we go.

9
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:15,083
(blowing air)

10
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,574
- This is gonna be really messy bro.

11
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:18,057
Is that gonna fit in your bottle dude?

12
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:19,607
- Alright for this prank gonna add some color in here,

13
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:21,173
so it's gonna add some little drops, here we go.

14
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:22,006
Dude, it's working!

15
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:23,133
Wait, what are you doing?

16
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:23,966
- I'm filling it up.

17
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:25,516
- Next step, we got the shaving cream.

18
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:26,349
- Do you hear that?

19
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:27,373
- What is going on?

20
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:28,706
Oh, snap. - Whoa.

21
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,706
- Dude, it's gonna get all tie dyed on the inside.

22
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:32,866
- Dude, that looks awesome.

23
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,798
- Oh my gosh bro, yours is just like a sack of orange juice.

24
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:37,711
- It's a winning sack of orange juice.

25
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:39,069
Now, I have to just twist it up,

26
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,354
and then I have to tie it off.

27
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:42,302
I'm gonna win this challenge.

28
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:43,214
- I don't think so.

29
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:45,117
- Next step, I'm cutting open the bottom of my carton.

30
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:46,519
I'm gonna use these. - Oh my god I'm gonna blow!

31
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:47,352
- What?

32
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:48,838
- Dude, this is so full it's literally about to pop.

33
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:50,428
It looks so wild.

34
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:51,585
- That looks so cool.

35
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,043
- And dude look around bottom bro.

36
00:00:53,043 --> 00:00:54,207
Gotta let a little bit of air go.

37
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:55,885
This is going well, this is going well, uh-oh

38
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:56,807
(screaming)

39
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,228
Whoa I added a lot in here. - Wow.

40
00:00:58,228 --> 00:01:00,002
- Hold up, if you thought you had a cool water balloon bro

41
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:01,693
you have nothing compared to this thing, dude.

42
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:02,929
This is awesome!

43
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,047
Alright next I'm gonna twist mine off like this.

44
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:05,864
Here we go, seal it, and now we've got to mix up

45
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:07,310
all the shaving cream and all the colors.

46
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,928
So here we go, it's really gonna mix it around like this,

47
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:09,872
oh man!

48
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:11,687
- This is much harder to cut then you'd think.

49
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,220
- Dude, it's super bouncy too, this is awesome!

50
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,737
(yelling)

51
00:01:14,737 --> 00:01:15,837
- And done, alright!

52
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:16,670
- You're already done?

53
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,756
- Yep I'm done, the bottom is out,

54
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:18,874
and what's your next step?

55
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:20,330
- Oh no, dude I wrecked the side.

56
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,163
(blowing air)

57
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:23,142
- Yo, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

58
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:24,671
- It worked, got the bottom off,

59
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:27,623
and now I gotta fit this ballon inside this milk carton, so.

60
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:28,456
- Good luck.

61
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,074
I got my next step is to put this balloon--

62
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:31,515
- I gotta squeeze it like this a little bit.

63
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:32,374
- in here.

64
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:34,049
- Here we go, like this, a little bit of a squeeze.

65
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,324
I think, I gotta empty this out a little bit.

66
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:37,474
So here we go, just going to be very careful here.

67
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:39,773
- It's going in, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

68
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:41,129
Now, I'm gonna try and turn it around.

69
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:42,174
- Wait how's it going to work it's supposed

70
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:43,007
to be on the other side?

71
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,565
- My hand is very squished right now.

72
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:45,398
- I think it's--

73
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:46,477
(balloon pops) (both scream)

74
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,751
- Oh man.

75
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,327
- What just happened?

76
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:52,028
All the shaving cream like stayed in the exact same shape

77
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,728
even though there's no balloon around it, what?

78
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:55,581
Wait this means I have to start over,

79
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,414
which actually is kind of perfect,

80
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:57,839
because I think there's a better way

81
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,310
of fitting the balloon inside the top of it.

82
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,513
Then get a balloon gonna put the balloon inside like this.

83
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:02,346
- I think I got it.

84
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:03,179
- You got it?

85
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:04,012
- Yeah! (triumphant music)

86
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:05,340
- That is such a struggle. - I got it! (laughs)

87
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,299
- Wait, that looks so weird.

88
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,454
- Okay, wait a second.

89
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:10,648
- Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

90
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:12,431
It's not going in my balloon.

91
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:13,264
Is it filling up the balloon on the inside?

92
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:14,097
- Wait dude what are you doing?

93
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:14,930
- I can't tell it's just all popping out.

94
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,761
- No it's not, at all, not at all.

95
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,594
(yelling)

96
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:18,427
(tense music) - Well I dunno what to do--

97
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:19,457
- Why are you bringing it towards me?

98
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:20,416
- What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?

99
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,739
- No dude, dude, what are you doing?

100
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,385
(both screaming)

101
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:25,465
- Maybe if I let the top go,

102
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:27,240
hopefully there is enough in there, so here we go.

103
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,331
(both yell)

104
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,252
- Aye ya yay.

105
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:30,124
- I'm sorry man.

106
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:30,957
(yells)

107
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:31,878
(laughs)

108
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:33,870
- I'm gonna grab out the little belly button of the balloon,

109
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,300
is that what it's called, the belly button of the balloon?

110
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,468
I get it across the top of the bottle.

111
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:37,986
Yep, yep, there we go, there we go, perfect!

112
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:38,819
I see what you mean, it's really hard

113
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:39,879
to screw this thing on man.

114
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,742
Boom alright top is on.

115
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:41,575
- Now, it's time to--

116
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:42,408
(splash) Oh!

117
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:43,737
- Oh man!

118
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:44,813
- And done.

119
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:46,021
- And now the moment someone opens this,

120
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,896
it's going to burst out and go everywhere!

121
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:49,401
So you get to comment down below,

122
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,532
whose do you think is gonna work better?

123
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:51,875
We'll be testing these at the end

124
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,341
to find out who's gonna win the $10,000.

125
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:56,233
You challenged us to do a coffee slime prank, so let's go.

126
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,710
- First up, I'm adding in some coffee.

127
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,252
- And I'm gonna make a fluffy slime, to kick it off.

128
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:00,871
So here we go, gonna add in a whole bunch of glue.

129
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,075
- Next up for the fluffy slime,

130
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:03,318
we got a new ingredient, we got some soap.

131
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:05,393
- So, we're just going to shoot some soap in here like this.

132
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,634
Soap is kind of fluffy, right?

133
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:07,467
You get all the suds and everything, so.

134
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:08,996
- Yep, yep, yep, I'm adding in the activator.

135
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:10,319
- We've never actually mixed coffee

136
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,014
and slime together, so how does it feel?

137
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:13,678
- Just like water and slime actually.

138
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:14,593
- Alright next up we're just gonna

139
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,068
add some food coloring in and this is always

140
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:17,335
the most pretty part of it man.

141
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:18,330
'Cause it looks so cool,

142
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,363
when stuff adds in. - Oh, yeah.

143
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:20,523
- Mine looks like an art challenge,

144
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:21,776
and time to mix it all up so here we go.

145
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:22,609
We're going to go in here like this

146
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,133
and just whoa, dude this is going to be

147
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,863
the craziest fluffy slime I've ever made man.

148
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:28,310
Look at all the tie dye right now bro, this is super cool!

149
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,590
You should just put that in your cup

150
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,423
and start getting your drink ready.

151
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:31,256
- Alright.

152
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:32,089
- So I guess we go in with the hands,

153
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:33,251
and this is probably gonna go everywhere let's see.

154
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,084
- Oh man!

155
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:38,258
- Oh that's so satisfying!

156
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:39,263
- Yep, yep, yep.

157
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:40,668
- It's like a clean sheet bro, okay.

158
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:42,073
- Pat on the back.

159
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:43,116
- I would pat you on the back right now, but.

160
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:43,949
- No please don't.

161
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,275
- I definitely thought with all the colors I added,

162
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,601
it would turn out a lot prettier,

163
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,398
but right now, it's definitely looking like a sludge.

164
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:49,766
- What kind of coffee is that?

165
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,720
- It's a Dumbo coffee, it looks like Dumbo.

166
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,049
Like a little trunk, it's like (mimics elephant trumpeting)

167
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:54,958
- Whoa, dude, dude, dude!

168
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,280
I'm making slime over here. - It looks like an elephant.

169
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,113
- But It looks like an elephant.

170
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,231
- I know I get it.

171
00:03:58,231 --> 00:03:59,064
- Hold it up there.

172
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:00,046
- It's stuck, it's stuck.

173
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:00,879
- Okay here you go, are you ready?

174
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,712
I'm just gonna drip it in.

175
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:02,612
- Yep, yep, yep, sorry!

176
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:04,095
- Devan, dude, it's coming down, bro, I need you to get it.

177
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:04,928
It's just stuck.

178
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:05,761
There we go, okay, there we go!

179
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:06,594
- There ya go. - Food coloring time,

180
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,260
we're going to add a little bit of blue.

181
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,784
Next up, I'm gonna add some yellow.

182
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,029
- First layer of slime is done.

183
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:12,225
You know what, this actually looks kinda

184
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:13,058
like a blueberry drink.

185
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:14,500
So this is not as bad as I thought it was.

186
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,379
For my coffee slime,

187
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,786
I'm not gonna use the actual coffee.

188
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:18,777
I've got a different idea, I've got some coffee beans here.

189
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:20,400
- I would not advise this Collins.

190
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,233
- Why not?

191
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:22,222
- You know what man, you do you.

192
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:24,276
- I absolutely will, oh this is perfect.

193
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:25,654
You know what, first I should add the glue in.

194
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:27,242
So here we go, we got some clear glue.

195
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:28,857
Flowing just like that, nice.

196
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:30,306
Alright, there we go perfect.

197
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:31,339
And next up we're gonna use the coffee grinder.

198
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,172
See Devan didn't do this,

199
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,993
'cause he doesn't have authentic coffee slime,

200
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:35,734
whereas I do, right now, so here we go.

201
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,638
- Mine was literally right from Starbucks bro.

202
00:04:37,638 --> 00:04:38,792
- Alright I'm gonna add in the coffee so here we go.

203
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,206
Gonna do a high pour you know very fancy like.

204
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:43,202
No, that, that's enough, that was not high enough.

205
00:04:43,202 --> 00:04:44,620
Coffee's in now it's time to mix it up,

206
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,534
so here we go, gonna go in with the hands, oh boy!

207
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:47,531
- This looks like some cheese.

208
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:48,987
- Why are you gonna put cheese in your coffee?

209
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:50,268
Is this like a Not Yo Cheese coffee?

210
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:51,969
Alright next I'm gonna add in the activator right now.

211
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:54,584
Yo the coffee beans were definitely the move.

212
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:57,636
This looks so cool, there is no way you can win, bro.

213
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:59,661
This is winning slime material right here.

214
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:00,865
You've got to admit it, Devan.

215
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:01,698
- Dude look at mine.

216
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:02,531
- Alright, this slime is done.

217
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:04,099
So now I've gotta get my cup, three, two, one,

218
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,125
pick up the cup, down, and oh boy.

219
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,156
Uh-oh, this is not working well, this is not working well.

220
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:09,356
Here we go, just gonna go in like this.

221
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:10,189
- Oh geez.

222
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:11,054
- Get all the top of the hands,

223
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:12,258
and get it popped in there like that.

224
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,763
It's usually not on the outside of the cup.

225
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:15,896
That would usually get a poor customer review,

226
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:17,239
but this is a different process here.

227
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,654
And for right now that should work

228
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:19,487
and I'm onto my final slime.

229
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,298
- I'm adding my second slime into the pancake art bottle.

230
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:23,885
- Wait that means you gonna be doing coffee art.

231
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:25,152
So now we're just gonna add in all the food coloring

232
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:26,850
right here like this, and now we're going to mix it up.

233
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,434
So we're gonna use this here and just mix it all up.

234
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:30,691
Oh bro, it looks like a sunset.

235
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:33,445
This is like the most pretty sunset of all time.

236
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:35,130
- Whoa this is some thick stuff, dude.

237
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,662
- Wait why are you decorating the inside of it?

238
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:38,194
I'm really concerned, this might not be coming together

239
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:40,146
at all and I'm concerned it could be the coconut milk.

240
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:41,092
I thought it was a stroke of genius,

241
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,260
it might be a stroke of bad luck.

242
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,266
- And done.

243
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:44,308
- You made all that slime,

244
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,305
just for that little bit right there?

245
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,516
- Yes I did, that's how you clench the win bro.

246
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,835
- Well, right now, I'm clenching the L, bro.

247
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:52,620
this looks more like a whole bunch of cobwebs,

248
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,808
than it does an actual slime.

249
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:54,641
- Wow.

250
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,474
- Alright this slime is all fixed up

251
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:57,331
and now I've got one last thing I wanna do,

252
00:05:57,331 --> 00:05:59,506
which is mix up these two slimes together.

253
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:00,914
Three, two, one, oh man.

254
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:01,761
- Oh wait why are you mixing those?

255
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,589
- Woah that looks super crazy man.

256
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:05,775
Oh boy, I wanna mix the blue slime and the other slime,

257
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:07,318
and just do it mid air like this.

258
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,308
It's just a one little mix like this, here we go.

259
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:11,758
Boom, and then just swirl it on the top just like this.

260
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:13,410
Alright time to add in the final slimes,

261
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,139
and this is really where the artist gets to come out,

262
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,647
and make this thing look beautiful.

263
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:17,480
Here's the big reveal.

264
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,557
Ready, Set, Go! - Ready, Set, Go!

265
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:19,390
(triumphant music)

266
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,223
Ta-da! - Ta-da!

267
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:21,056
- Dude.

268
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,135
- Whoa bro, that looks so good.

269
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:22,968
- Whoa yours looks great too dude.

270
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,411
- Thank you, man, but now I understand

271
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,576
what you were talking about with the topping,

272
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,233
using it as art on the inside.

273
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,892
You get to vote down below, who recreated the drink better?

274
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:30,725
We'll be testing them at the end

275
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:33,188
to find out who's gonna win the $10,000.

276
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:35,255
You challenged us to do the edible iPhone prank,

277
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:36,088
so let's go.

278
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:36,921
First step, we're gonna be adding some honey,

279
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:38,167
and the next step we're gonna be adding

280
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,273
a whole bunch of peanut butter here, so here we go.

281
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:41,399
Big ol' scoop of peanut butter.

282
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,907
- Wow, dude that's a lot of everything.

283
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:44,668
I only think we need a quarter of a cup.

284
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:46,116
- That's 'cause you're making a regular iPhone, Devan.

285
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:48,870
I'm making the iPhone plus, plus, plus, plus, plus MAX.

286
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,227
It's bigger than a desktop computer.

287
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:52,093
- Bigger than a desktop, smaller than a rug.

288
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:53,785
- Next up, we've gotta mix up some peanut butter and honey.

289
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:55,563
And I could do this with a normal spatula,

290
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:56,687
but it's peanut butter and honey,

291
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,990
I wanna use my hands, so here we go, oh man!

292
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,858
This feels so wild! - Wow.

293
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:02,229
- I finally got my quarter cup mixed.

294
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:03,424
- Why would you use your hands?

295
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,125
- Yeah 'cause I gotta go man.

296
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:05,958
(laughs)

297
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,916
It's not a good reason, but it's true.

298
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,250
I think this all just turned into

299
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,457
like a super creamy peanut butter, man.

300
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:12,040
(air bubbles releasing)

301
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,709
It's the honey, not me, just relax okay.

302
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:14,908
- Next up we go on a date.

303
00:07:14,908 --> 00:07:16,039
I mean we grab some dates.

304
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:17,616
- (laughs) I was like, what?

305
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:18,689
- (laughs) And we get some almonds.

306
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,729
- Well I guess that you're all now

307
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:20,807
going on a date with Devan.

308
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,566
So, you're probably going to do a pancake art challenge,

309
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,098
'cause that's all Devan does in his free time.

310
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:25,220
- What, that is so not true!

311
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,881
- This has gotta be the creamiest peanut butter

312
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:29,751
I've ever seen so now we're moving on to the next step.

313
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,647
We gotta squeeze this out, oh, dripping down the side.

314
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:32,520
Devan, you want to lick it off?

315
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,353
- What, no I don't.

316
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,592
- Alright, we got my dates just gonna put them here.

317
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:36,013
- Oh hey, we're going on a date with Collins, now.

318
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:38,668
- Yeet, the best way to start off a first date is to yeet.

319
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,245
You gotta get a couple of yeets, then go at a yeet,

320
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:42,189
a fleet, a deet and a seet.

321
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:43,713
(glass shatters) (laughs)

322
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,718
- Next up I have to mash up my almonds.

323
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:47,076
- Wait usually I would be doing this,

324
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:49,127
what, it looks like roles have been reversed here today.

325
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,290
Bro we haven't even gotten to the mess yet.

326
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,848
- Ah, ah, ah, ah!

327
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:53,117
- Bro who are you right now?

328
00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:54,658
- Next up I add the oats.

329
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:55,491
- And do not try this at home,

330
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,277
but I'm just gonna dice up my almonds just like this.

331
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,530
Roles are kinda being reversed right now,

332
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,111
because usually you would be the one using this,

333
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:00,977
and doing it in a very civilized way

334
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:01,885
but I think I'm actually getting some great chunks of--

335
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:04,221
- Yep but not today! (pounding)

336
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:05,593
- Oh my gosh, time to add the peanut butter

337
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:06,754
and honey to this, and this is

338
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:07,868
where it really turns into the treat.

339
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,153
So, oh man now I'm just gonna mix

340
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:11,845
all these things up together, oh boy.

341
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:14,372
- This was all fun and games, now it's time to focus.

342
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:15,419
- What do you mean wait, wait, focus?

343
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,458
What you weren't focused?

344
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,234
- Like the samurai, calm and focus.

345
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:20,602
- And on my side of the table man.

346
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:22,064
You're taking up a lot of space right now Devan, your elbow.

347
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:23,425
- It's all part of the focus.

348
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:24,438
- You're gonna get your elbow in my peanut butter, bro.

349
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:25,281
My peanut butter's coming real close to your elbow.

350
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,447
- I can barely hear you!

351
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:27,956
Now it's time to roll it out.

352
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:29,241
- Wait, I am so confused,

353
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:30,445
I'm on like a completely different step.

354
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:32,303
Next up, I need to change the color of my mixture here,

355
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,592
so we're gonna add some of this in here.

356
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:34,751
This is activated charcoal.

357
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,671
So now we gotta mix these up into it, so here we go.

358
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:37,735
Oh man, it's really starting to work bro.

359
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:39,317
They're kinda like busting open in weird ways, here we go.

360
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:40,609
- Yeah, they totally are.

361
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:42,785
- It's all about the wrist strength, man.

362
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:45,066
- You would be so good at the Hedgehog Game bro.

363
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,229
- Oh man, like Whack-a-mole.

364
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:47,842
In hindsight I really should've broken open

365
00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:49,331
these capsules individually 'cause right now

366
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:50,976
I think there's just a whole bunch of whole ones in here,

367
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:52,185
just waiting to burst at any second.

368
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:53,018
- A whole bunch of whole.

369
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:54,334
Now it's time to add my peanut butter and honey.

370
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,196
Like that, yeah.

371
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:57,423
- Dude you're splashing me with your peanut butter, bro.

372
00:08:57,423 --> 00:08:58,690
I gotta say now that the color's changing

373
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,900
it no longer looks as appetizing.

374
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,840
I've never eaten a charcoal energy bar before,

375
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,121
so this is gonna be a first experience, you know.

376
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:06,033
- This got really hard, really fast, dude.

377
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,316
- I've made so much there's no way

378
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:09,018
this is gonna be an iPhone, so I'm doing an iPad.

379
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:09,851
(triumphant music)

380
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:11,742
So here we go, I'm gonna throw it in my mold right now.

381
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:12,854
So here we go just gonna lift up a big chunk of it,

382
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:13,862
and then just gonna put it in here on the inside.

383
00:09:13,862 --> 00:09:14,985
- You know what, I'm gonna actually

384
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:16,560
add some more honey to try to help it out.

385
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,732
- Oh can you add some to mine please?

386
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:18,565
That would be really helpful actually.

387
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:19,398
- Yeah sure. - You're welcome.

388
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:20,231
- Thank you, see even when having

389
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:21,897
a competition over $10 000, we still help each other out.

390
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:23,032
That's enough Devan. - Yup, ah-hm.

391
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:24,773
- That's enough, dude. - What?

392
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,975
- That's more than enough. - Okay.

393
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:26,808
- Alright here we go, just gonna use

394
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:28,294
the edge here really cleverly.

395
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:29,415
- Collins you're dripping some honey.

396
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:30,780
- Don't judge my process, it's mine.

397
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,686
I gotta say man this is actually gonna be filling up

398
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:33,519
the mold perfectly.

399
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,386
- It's good and mixed,

400
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:36,006
and now it's time to roll it out on a pan.

401
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:38,159
- We gotta test to make sure that the top of mine will close

402
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,241
so here we go, just gonna see if goes.

403
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,984
Three, two, one, ah perfect.

404
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:42,195
You know when you show up to school,

405
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:43,028
and you gotta give a little presentation you go,

406
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:45,521
yep it's right here on my iPad.

407
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:46,391
Is yours almost done?

408
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:47,435
- Yep it's almost done.

409
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:48,847
- Right next up, we gotta pop these things in the fridge,

410
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:50,117
and let 'em freeze up a little bit.

411
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:51,282
Alright we got them out of the refrigerator,

412
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:53,021
and now it's time to paint up our devices.

413
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:54,440
First just gotta undo mine a little bit.

414
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,109
Hold on it's just a little stuck currently, sorry.

415
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,977
I can't even get it apart right now.

416
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:00,343
(Groans) Oh!

417
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:01,176
(banging)

418
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,299
- Collins, did you just lose this?

419
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,132
- Nope.

420
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:04,978
- I'm gonna use my phone as a guide actually.

421
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,654
- Alright just gonna keep pressing this down here.

422
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:08,195
Next thing we're making some cashew butter, so here we go.

423
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:09,823
Now it's time to color these in, so here we go.

424
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:11,729
Gonna dump this into my piping bag, oh!

425
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,049
- What, piping bag?

426
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:14,835
- Oh my gosh, that was not at all how

427
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:16,193
that was supposed to go man.

428
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:17,329
- Alright I've laid down the foundation,

429
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:18,778
now it's time to spread it out.

430
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:20,559
I'm hoping I don't get any hairs in mine.

431
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,392
- Why?

432
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:22,225
- 'Cause I'm using a brush.

433
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:23,661
- Yo yours looks just like an iPhone,

434
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:24,864
and absolutely delicious.

435
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:27,230
Here we go the big reveal. - Three, two, one.

436
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,805
- We've got a 5 second subscribe challenge,

437
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:30,137

438
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:32,861

00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:33,694
You ready?

440
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:34,527
Here we go.

441
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:35,360
Five. - Five.

442
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,193
- Four. - Four.

443
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:37,026
- Three. - Three.

444
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:37,859
- Two. - Two.

445
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:38,692
- One. - One.

446
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:39,525
- Done. - Done.

447
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:40,358
- If you can do a comment down below,

448
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:41,191
Keyper Squad, right now.

449
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,194
Ready, Set, Go! - Ready, Set, Go!

450
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:43,626
- Oh! - Oh!

451
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:44,993
- Dude it turned out so good!

452
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:46,827
- Yep that looks great, Collins.

453
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:47,660
- Thank you Devan.

454
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,563
You challenged us to make the Jelly Egg Prank, so let's go.

455
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:52,004
It's very important you wanna poke one hole

456
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:53,791
in the top and a bigger hole in the bottom.

457
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,994
Once the holes are poked,

458
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:56,618
there's basically a magic trick you can do with the egg,

459
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:58,280
you can empty it super fast just like this.

460
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,024
Check it out, three, two, one.

461
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,067
(eggs squelching)

462
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:02,900
Whoa man just like that,

463
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,059
you can clear out your egg without cracking it open,

464
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,717
and this is gonna be very important for the prank.

465
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:08,378
I'm surprised you haven't run out of breath yet man,

466
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:09,211
that's crazy.

467
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,369
- Lungs of iron.

468
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,202
(metal clings)

469
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:12,035
- It looks like a little head.

470
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:13,412
It's like the egg is now a little person.

471
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:14,660
Now for the color of the jelly,

472
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,857
I'm going to be using Spirulina.

473
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:17,227
I'm gonna put this in my little masher right here.

474
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:18,383
- And I'm gonna use blueberries.

475
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:21,420
- Alright so let's, oops that is not the Spirulina.

476
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,583
- I don't know if this is a good idea dude.

477
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,433
- You gotta powderizer bro, dude.

478
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,331
Mine is already starting to come off man, I can--

479
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:27,164
- I'm so nervous.

480
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:28,190
- Alright gonna fill these things up with water,

481
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,178
and next up we're gonna be adding in the color.

482
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:32,449
Alright that should be about good right there.

483
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:33,698
- Oh, oh, oh, it's splashing.

484
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:35,888
- Oh my gosh dude, that like worked immediately.

485
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:36,721
- Yeah.

486
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:37,998
- Put a little bit in like this, whoa

487
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,288
there is like a giant green cloud right now.

488
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:40,701
It looks like an evil potion.

489
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,264
Next up we're gonna add a quarter teaspoon of agar agar.

490
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:45,131
So here we go, oh wait that was a lot.

491
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:46,456
Well there we go we just gotta kinda do it.

492
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,832
- Wait that's not a quarter teaspoon.

493
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,665
- Once this heats up,

494
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:49,953
we'll be putting this inside the egg,

495
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:51,560
and turning it into a jelly egg.

496
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,151
Now the best part time to fill up these eggs

497
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:54,073
with this jelly.

498
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:57,109
So here we go, gotta suck up this good juice right here.

499
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:57,942
- I think I got it.

500
00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:59,471
- Alright here we go, let's get a ton of it out.

501
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:00,964
Got enough of mine in here perfect.

502
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:01,925
Wait what are you doing?

503
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:03,498
- I don't know dude, it's malfunctioning.

504
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:04,965
- Alright time to add in the jelly, here we go.

505
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:06,793
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

506
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,412
Alright here we go, gonna fill this thing up,

507
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:10,760
just like this, here we go, is yours going in?

508
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,915
- Mine's working, dude.

509
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:12,748
(splats)

510
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,672
- Oh! It just popped open bro. - What just happened?

511
00:12:14,672 --> 00:12:15,671
What?

512
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:16,504
- Oh no!

513
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:19,395
- You just blasted me in the face.

514
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:20,431
The eggs filled up with jelly,

515
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:21,548
and you get to comment down below.

516
00:12:21,548 --> 00:12:23,542
Which one do you think is gonna look crazier?

517
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,576
We'll be testing these at the end,

518
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:27,234
to find out who's gonna win the $10,000.

519
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,197
You challenged us to make a cactus,

520
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,562
you can literally eat so right now let's go.

521
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:31,472
First up we're gonna be dicing up some cashews

522
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:33,336
and do not try this at home.

523
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,506
- The goal is you gotta go nice, fine and precise,

524
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,212
use one finger as the axis point.

525
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:39,242
- Dude this is a game changer, bro.

526
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:40,075
Devan, you're like a chef, man.

527
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:41,280
- Yeah like a Masterchef, bro.

528
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,350
- You should start your own restaurant.

529
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,464
A pancake art restaurant.

530
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:45,180
We've gotta get these things finely diced up,

531
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,985
so we're gonna use our food processors here.

532
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:48,686
- Yo dude, it's like a little avalanche.

533
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:49,519
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

534
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,713
(whirring)

535
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,210
- Woah, we should have done this from the beginning man,

536
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,423
this way faster than what we were just doing.

537
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:54,582
- I think we're done.

538
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:55,707
- Now since this is the base of the cactus,

539
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:57,489
we're gonna be adding some matcha powder here

540
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:58,322
to make it all green.

541
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:00,937
- Oh no, it turns green immediately, bro.

542
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:02,675
- Next up we're gonna add in some oats and some milk.

543
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:05,124
Aim is on point did you see that, bro?

544
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:06,251
- Yeah, it didn't splash or anything.

545
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,084
- Alright here we go.

546
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:08,163
Next up I'm just gonna get the hands in here.

547
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:08,996
- Ugh!

548
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,612
- It looks like a chunky green tea milkshake.

549
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:12,912
- Ugh! (laughs)

550
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:14,108
To make edible dirt, we've got some bread,

551
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,476
and my guy looks like you just woke him up from a nap,

552
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,296
he's like, get off my lawn kids.

553
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,173
Next up we're gonna chop these things up, so here we go.

554
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,877
That's first up. - Stop with the bread, dude.

555
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:22,041
- It's bread on bread, bro.

556
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,828
- Dude, okay, alright. (grunts)

557
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:27,050
Well first step is you gotta get your container here.

558
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,804
And then thank you Collins, you're filling up my container.

559
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:31,361
- Gotta get all these pieces in crumbs of bread, bro.

560
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:33,515
- I will definitely win this, because of all of your help.

561
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:36,058
- Within a matter of seconds, I have created the dirt.

562
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:37,460
What would have taken you a lifetime.

563
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,993
Say hello to my little planter.

564
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:39,826
(triumphant music)

565
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:41,141
I'm going to use this thing as my cactus base.

566
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:42,257
- You're using the little one?

567
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:43,090
- Nope. (buzz)

568
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,736
Big planter it is, I'm gonna make a huge cactus.

569
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:45,569
- That's what I thought.

570
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:46,723
- So first up I'm just gonna pack some bread

571
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:47,764
down in here just like this.

572
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:49,625
Yo wait a minute, yours looks like real dirt, man.

573
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,949
Like yours actually looks, - Thank you.

574
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:51,782
- like what it's supposed to.

575
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:52,643
Not that mine looks any different.

576
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:53,476
Alright here we go just gonna--

577
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:54,559
Oh no! - What?

578
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,006
- I cracked open the side of my planter.

579
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,419
Now it's time to shape the cactus.

580
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,952
- And I'll be using this pretzel as the skeleton.

581
00:14:00,952 --> 00:14:02,035
- The issue is if you use a pretzel,

582
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:03,194
it's very easy to break that skeleton,

583
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:04,573
so I'm gonna be using this.

584
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:06,193
Next up we're just going to cover this thing,

585
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:08,222
and fully mold it in my cactus.

586
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,792
So here we go there's a little pretzel stuck on the side,

587
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,831
we gotta get that outta here, you're weak pretzel.

588
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,658
And now it looks more like a Christmas tree.

589
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:15,576
Alright, I'm gonna give my little cactus arm over here,

590
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:16,774
so it's like yes, here we go.

591
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,176
- You know what, I've got a vision for mine.

592
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:19,923
- Here I've got an idea, so what we're gonna have to do

593
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:20,791
is we're gonna have to give him a little bit of a belly

594
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,624
right now.

595
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:23,788
- I feel like I'm making an oven mitt, rather than a cactus.

596
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:25,513
- Alright we're gonna give my dude a little hat right here.

597
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:28,330
So he's gonna (laughs) the new evolution of the bucket hat.

598
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,153
Gonna add a mouth for him so here we go.

599
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:31,451
A little mouth right here like this.

600
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,231
Yours is more like a tombstone than a cactus right.

601
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,064
What's going on?

602
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,462
- Hold on Collins, what is that?

603
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,474
- This is my cactus, his name is Gafoam.

604
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:38,610
- You named him, already?

605
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,520
- He's like, oh ya boy!

606
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,578
(laughs)

607
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:43,670
- Who would mistake that for a cactus?

608
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,145
- That is crazy, bro yours looks just like a cactus.

609
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:46,993
So here's the big reveal.

610
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:48,615
Ready, set, go! - Ready, set, go!

611
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:49,568
- Ta-da - Ta-da!

612
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,276
Dude yours looks really good,

613
00:14:51,276 --> 00:14:53,179
but mine, it's got personality.

614
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:54,670
So you get to comment down below,

615
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,866
who do you think won this round?

616
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:56,943
We'll be testing them at the end,

617
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,475
to find out who's gonna win the $10,000.

618
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:00,987
You challenged us to make a disgusting pie prank,

619
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:01,820
so let's go.

620
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,171
- I'm starting off by cooking the ground beef.

621
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,621
- I'm gonna add the oil in right now.

622
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:05,983
- Alright, I'm gonna let this cook and now

623
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,095
I'm on to cutting up the onions.

624
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:09,624
- Bro I am gonna start crying for real right now, man.

625
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:11,614
This is very, very, very strong in smell.

626
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:13,022
- No dude you're crying 'cause you're about

627
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:13,855
to lose this challenge.

628
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:14,688
(air horn)

629
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:15,554
- I'm gonna slice up my onion.

630
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:17,419
Oh my gosh my nose is burning right now.

631
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:18,491
This is the prank right here,

632
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,149
the prank is to get you with your nose burning.

633
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,518
And do not try this at home.

634
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:23,573
How much more do we have to chop these up, dude?

635
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,166
I can't tell if it just got into my eyes

636
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,955
or if they're just starting to water 'cause of the smell.

637
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:27,893
But like that burns.

638
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,217
- Time to add it in. - This is no joke.

639
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:31,504
Oh my gosh, I'm falling apart.

640
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:33,279
Oh my gosh, I'm falling apart.

641
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,390
- And if it weren't bad enough,

642
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,676
it's time to grab the garlic now.

643
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:37,635
- Bro it burns! (screams)

644
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:38,846
Alright here we go I'm just gonna add these in.

645
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:40,385
I can't see anything.

646
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:41,452
(screams)

647
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:42,294
- What?

648
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:43,285
(screams)

649
00:15:43,285 --> 00:15:44,118
- Next up we're gotta get the garlic, here we go.

650
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:45,431
Just gonna slice like that, here we go.

651
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:47,667
Boom like that, I'm like, totally gone right now.

652
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,032
- You look intense.

653
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,074
He doesn't do well with tickling and onions.

654
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:52,736
- Yeah tickling, that's even worse.

655
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:54,228
How do I break these cloves up?

656
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:55,800
So let's see, if I just pull a clove, there we go.

657
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,008
- Yep. - Do we just put

658
00:15:57,008 --> 00:15:57,841
the whole clove in there?

659
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:58,758
I'm gonna try a different way of smashing up my garlic

660
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,434
so here we go, just gonna go with a little clove here.

661
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:02,290
- Oh, oh, oh, oh you're splashing it everywhere, dude.

662
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,528
- This is actually working really well, here we go,

663
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:04,856
this is good enough. - Yeah for you.

664
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:05,807
- And now it's time to add in the meat.

665
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:06,881
Here we go, just gonna get a little chunk right here.

666
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,211
- Yeah paprika.

667
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:09,208
- Oh that's a big spoonful,

668
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,657
here we go, I'm just gonna add that in.

669
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:11,568
Wait, you've got paprika?

670
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:12,902
Just gonna add a ton of paprika right now.

671
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:14,599
I want this to be completely paprika flavored,

672
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,754
that's part of the prank for me.

673
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:16,632
Once people are done eating my dish,

674
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:18,490
I want them to be like, paprika!

675
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,323
- Alright just a dash of salt next.

676
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:22,208
- I'm gonna add a dash of my Morton salt, there we go.

677
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,117
The combination of the sodium and paprika's

678
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,838
gonna make them go, saltapapika!

679
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:26,671
(laughs)

680
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:28,185
Dude and this is coming together so well,

681
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:29,989
it looks really delicious until you remember

682
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,887
it's got a ton of salt and paprika in it.

683
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:33,711
Next up it's time to make the strawberry topping

684
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:35,364
so we're gonna add some beet into some potatoes

685
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:36,496
and mash these things up.

686
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,613
Gonna add in the potato and the beet

687
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,536
and see if it mixes at the same time, you ready?

688
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:41,287
Three, two, one. - Two, one.

689
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,120
- Oh dude.

690
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,953
- Did it work?

691
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:43,829
- Yeah. - Yeah.

692
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:45,362
It's crazy how quick the beet changes

693
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:46,886
the color of these potatoes, man.

694
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:48,832
The only thing that gives this away right now is the smell

695
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:51,287
but other than that, this looks really, really close

696
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:52,744
to a strawberry topping, bro.

697
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,816
The strawberry topping is done and now we've gotta

698
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:57,341
add in some Worcestershire sauce.

699
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:58,636
If there's one thing I learned about cooking,

700
00:16:58,636 --> 00:16:59,886
it's whenever you find a good ingredient,

701
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,339
you wanna add as much of it as possible.

702
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:02,494
- Words to live by.

703
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:03,327
- And now to finish it off,

704
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:04,160
I've gotta add in some breadcrumbs.

705
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,864
- Alright time to add in my wer-ser-shier sauce.

706
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:08,315
Worst, wor-cest-er-shire.

707
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:09,350
- This is looking perfect, man.

708
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,684
See no measurements, no nothing.

709
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:12,875
'Cause I'm a chef genius, I've got a secret ingredient

710
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,087
I'm gonna be adding in right now, Devan.

711
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:17,061
Oh no, that's about all of it.

712
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:17,894
- Did that work?

713
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:18,727
- This is how you come up with innovation,

714
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:19,992
this is how you create three Michelin Star dishes,

715
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:20,825
right here.

716
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:22,282
Michelin Star people, review this.

717
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:23,784
- I'd say that gets a three star.

718
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:25,029
- I could not agree more.

719
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,862
(record scratches)

720
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:26,695
- Yeah, what, no.

721
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:28,015
- What was that look? - Definitely a three star.

722
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:28,848
Nothing, nothing.

723
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,998
- We've gotten back our crust

724
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:31,205
and now it's time to construct the meat pies.

725
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:32,700
- I dunno whose looks worse, dude.

726
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,701
(laughs) - I think yours does.

727
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:35,610
- Mine's got a very distinctive look to it,

728
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,443
if you know what I mean.

729
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:37,765
Now it's time to add the topping

730
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,600
and finish this thing off.

731
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,518
Yo these are a perfect replica of pies

732
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,702
so right now, the big reveal, so here we go.

733
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,340
Three, two, oh, yeah, - Three, two, oh wait.

734
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,756
- Oh yeah, if you wanna win a 15 minute video call

735
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:47,323
with Devan and I, text the word, PRANK

736
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:49,106
to 81800 right now

737
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:50,695
So pause the video, text the word, PRANK

738
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,146
to 81800, you'll automatically be entered in to win.

739
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:54,054
And let's see how this looks.

740
00:17:54,054 --> 00:17:55,702
Ready, set, go. - Ready, set, go.

741
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:56,535
- Ta-da! - Ta-da!

742
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,161
- Dude that looks absolutely perfect.

743
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,652
You get to vote and comment down below,

744
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:02,060
who recreated this dish better?

745
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,665
We've got the pranks, we've got the $10,000,

746
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:05,498
- What? - and now it's time to test

747
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,522
all these pranks to find out who's gonna win

748
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:08,526
all of that money.

749
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:10,185
And this is the one I'm most excited for,

750
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:12,583
'cause we're gonna be seeing which one makes a bigger mess.

751
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,179
And the thing about this prank is, think about it,

752
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:15,049
you go in and grab some orange juice,

753
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:16,587
you open it up, you expect to fill up a glass

754
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:18,242
of orange juice but instead it's like a magic trick.

755
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,748
It just like bursts out, starts levitating in the air.

756
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:21,255
- Yep, alright here we go.

757
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:22,473
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

758
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:24,056
(shouts)

759
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:24,889
What?

760
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:26,596
- I've gotta say, from a mess perspective,

761
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:28,004
that definitely checks the box, man.

762
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:29,080
- (claps) Beat that, bro.

763
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,027
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

764
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:31,986
(shouts)

765
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,107
Dude. - What?

766
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:34,266
(shouts)

767
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:36,470
- Man, it's like a weird snake just popping out.

768
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,961
- I dunno dude, I think I won.

769
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:39,477
- Yeah, you definitely won on that one.

770
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:41,200
- Time to test the edible Apple products right now.

771
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,442
- Oh hey, hey, can you hold on one second,

772
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:43,310
- What? - I'm on the phone.

773
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,301
Alright, sorry, what were you saying?

774
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:45,134
- Yeah but that's just you got your edible iPhone, dude.

775
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:46,001
- What, really, you could tell?

776
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,072
- So off the bat, I think mine looks pretty saucy, man.

777
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:49,194
- I mean, mine though.

778
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,397
I think it looks pretty close.

779
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:51,643
I mean, it's got the home button,

780
00:18:51,643 --> 00:18:52,879
the camera, everything, dude.

781
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:53,914
- So now to find out how they taste,

782
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,701
this is really what it comes down to right now.

783
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:56,856
- Yeah so we gotta switch.

784
00:18:56,856 --> 00:18:59,212
Oh, yours is really gooey.

785
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:00,545
Three, two, one.

786
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,213
Woah.

787
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:04,168
- It taste really good, right, right, right?

788
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:05,960
- And these almonds are so hard.

789
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,658
- Well I can't control the density of almonds.

790
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:11,479
Three, two, one. - Two, one.

791
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:12,312
How is it?

792
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:13,145
- I'm mad.

793
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:14,096
- Why, yes?

794
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:14,929
- 'Cause it tastes really good.

795
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:15,762
- Yes!

796
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:16,862
- I'm not even mad, bro you totally won.

797
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:17,695
- Well thank you.

798
00:19:17,695 --> 00:19:18,539
- We've got the coffee slime prank.

799
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,539
- And this will be judged only on one thing.

800
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:21,996
- How cool your yellow slime looks.

801
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:22,947
- Yeah, what?

802
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:23,865
- I gotta mix mine up, though you know,

803
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:24,703
to make it look all good.

804
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:25,733
And the second part of the criteria

805
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,362
is who has better mixed slime?

806
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:28,195
- What?

807
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:30,018
- Dude, all the coffee just came right out.

808
00:19:30,018 --> 00:19:32,165
What happened when you mixed that into coffee slime?

809
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:32,998
- Whoa!

810
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:34,166
It's like water. - Turned to water.

811
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,532
I think it's gonna ruin my other one.

812
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:37,930
- Even when it's mixed up, yours looks way cooler than mine.

813
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,919
Well, I guess you won.

814
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:40,540
Time to test the jelly egg prank

815
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,129
and on this one, we'll be judging three things.

816
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:43,081
How does it look on the outside?

817
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,157
How does it look on the inside?

818
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:45,606
And how does it taste?

819
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:47,825
First of all Devan, I think mine looks pretty amazing.

820
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:49,107
Wait a minute, what was that?

821
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:49,940
- Oh nothing.

822
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,816
- No turn your egg over, bro.

823
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:51,649
- There's nothing on it.

824
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,482
- Turn your egg.

825
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,148
- Fine, fine, I know. - Oh, snap.

826
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:55,635
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

827
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:56,818
Oh, I think I need to crack mine.

828
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:59,282
- Oh, it's the perfect split, bro.

829
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,268
- Dude mine looks like an iceberg, bro.

830
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,340
- I think-- - I think mine won.

831
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,173
- Yeah yours, - For sure.

832
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:04,114
- wins on the inside.

833
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:05,891
- The tie breaker is whose tastes better.

834
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:06,928
'Cause imagine someone breaks this open,

835
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,427
gets extremely confused but goes you know what,

836
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:09,837
I'm gonna try to taste it.

837
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:10,869
You want them to have a little bit of a nice surprise.

838
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,119
Three, two, one. - Two, one.

839
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:16,607
Mine doesn't taste like anything.

840
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:17,440
- Ha!

841
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,790
- What, mine tastes fine?

842
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,749
I think I won that one, dude. - Yes!

843
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:22,050
Okay, we're onto the next one. - Alright.

844
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,264
- Time to judge the edible cactus's

845
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,717
and we're basing this off of two things.

846
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:26,344
How close to a cactus does it look?

847
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:28,197
And number two, how good does it taste?

848
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,863
- Which I have to say right off the bat,

849
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:32,356
that doesn't even pass as a cactus from a distance.

850
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,189
- I'll give it to you,

851
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:34,124
yours does look-- - Thank you, yes.

852
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:36,310
- A tiny, tiny bit more like a cactus.

853
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,403
- What a tiny bit?

854
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,006
- How about this I try yours and you try mine?

855
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,352
- Alright, I'll take a bite of yours first.

856
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:42,422
- Be careful, you knocked his mouth off!

857
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:43,255
- I'll take an arm off.

858
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:44,088
- Don't take his--

859
00:20:44,088 --> 00:20:44,921
- Why?

860
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:46,289
- Just take a bite of him like a normal person.

861
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:47,490
- I don't care what you say,

862
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,323
I'm taking off the arm.

863
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:50,327
Three, two, one.

864
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:51,418
- What a weird bite.

865
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,159
- So much matcha.

866
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,400
That's really pasty, dude.

867
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,572
- Here we go, three, two, one.

868
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:57,523
- How is it?

869
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,581
- Oh, oh. - Really good, right?

870
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,195
Whoa, wait, what are you doing?

871
00:21:00,195 --> 00:21:01,142
That's yours.

872
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:02,052
- I need some dirt.

873
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,885
Whoa. - What?

874
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:03,718
- It's not bad at all.

875
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:04,692
- It looks like I won this, dude.

876
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:05,767
- You took this round

877
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,050
but right now we're onto the next one.

878
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,292
We've got the meat pie prank and we'll be judging

879
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,591
it on two things.

880
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:10,998
Number one, how good does it look?

881
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:13,316
And number two, how bad does it taste?

882
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:14,474
Let's cut out a slice of pie.

883
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,041
Mine's like rock solid right now, man.

884
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,438
- It's a testament to the strength of your pie.

885
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:19,941
I don't know if I did a good cut, man.

886
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:21,185
- At least because it's rock solid

887
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:22,888
it's staying together in one piece very easily.

888
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:23,721
(shouts)

889
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:24,554
- What?

890
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:26,833
Oh yeah. - Oh my gosh, dude.

891
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:27,809
- That looks so good, bro.

892
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:28,642
- Yes.

893
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:30,033
- Alright, let's see about mine here.

894
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:30,866
Oh! - That totally passes.

895
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:32,203
Alright, so based on looks.

896
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:33,622
- It is a tie, you can see one of these

897
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:35,115
- Sure, sure. - And know that's a cake.

898
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:36,319
Alright Collins, you don't have to work anymore.

899
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,228
- So as the tie breaker,

900
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:39,144
it all comes down to which one tastes worse.

901
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:39,977
We have to switch pieces.

902
00:21:39,977 --> 00:21:40,810
- Man, dude.

903
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,014
- So I mean, this is a great prank.

904
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:43,793
You would see this thing as a nice little piece right here

905
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:44,659
and then take a bite of it.

906
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,187
It's gonna taste very different than what you would expect.

907
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:50,127
So Devan, I'll take my bite first, three, two, one.

908
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:51,637
- How is it, is it gross?

909
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:52,470
(mumbling)

910
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,303
Dude, does it actually taste good?

911
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:54,576
- At first it is really confusing

912
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:56,854
'cause you expect it to be sweet and it's like, not at all.

913
00:21:56,854 --> 00:21:58,890
But then, you actually made a really good tasting meat pie.

914
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,723
- No!

915
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:00,556
Ready,

916
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:01,528
- I feel so bad for you, man.

917
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,553
- Set, go.

918
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:04,158
- And all of the salt I put in there, too.

919
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:06,735
- Whoa, that's a lot of salt.

920
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:08,108
- There's a whole bunch of salt, Worcestershire sauce.

921
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:09,559
- I don't taste anything else.

922
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,777
- There's also a whole bunch of cocoa in it.

923
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:13,734
- Why would you do that?

924
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:14,899
- I'm sorry and also the paprika,

925
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,105
you can't forget about the paprika, bro.

926
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:18,268
- I think you won this one, dude.

927
00:22:18,268 --> 00:22:19,226
- Awesome, alright, cool.

928
00:22:19,226 --> 00:22:20,468
And now we're onto the next one.

929
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:21,589
Alright, so the next thing we're going to be doing--

930
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:22,657
- Whoa, whoa, hold on, one second, one second.

931
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:23,606
I'll just do my hair real quick.

932
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:25,475
- Who brings a blow dryer to film a video?

933
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:26,846
- This is supposed to be working.

934
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:27,882
- I don't know what you're doing with that,

935
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:29,060
that is never gonna work, alright, right now we're on--

936
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,393
(whooshing)

937
00:22:34,524 --> 00:22:37,191
(hip hop music)

938
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:48,540
- Bro this is a nice blow dryer, I like this thing.

939
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,819
(coughing)

940
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:50,652
You okay there?

941
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:51,770
- Are you kidding me?

942
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,579
Alright, well right now let's find out who won the $10,000.

943
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:55,990
Bro I am definitely getting you back.

944
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,721
Whoa, okay, scared me there for a second.

That's right, it's me. - Congratulations, bro.

Nicely done, your pranks were, - Yes.

- Un-pause me Devan, dude un-pause me.

988

- Dude, it's all done, now it's all done.
