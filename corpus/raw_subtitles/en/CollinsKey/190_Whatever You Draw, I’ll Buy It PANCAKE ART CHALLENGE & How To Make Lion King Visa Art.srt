1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
- Yo, I can't believe we are actually doing this!

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,988
Oh my gosh!

3
00:00:02,988 --> 00:00:05,510
(upbeat pop music)

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,339
They have it, this is the exact same one he drew!

5
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,528
No way!

6
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:10,243
I don't know man, should we buy it?

7
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,630
You challenged us to the you draw it,

8
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,780
I'll buy it challenge, but with a pancake art twist.

9
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,810
We're drawing six expensive luxury items,

10
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,510
and we're kicking it off with our dream tech products,

11
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,343
so let's go.

12
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:20,970
Devan, I've wanted these things for years,

13
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,230
so I really hope you actually buy it for me.

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,036
Wait, what kind of tech is that bro?

15
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:26,010
If that's the new iPhone I'm going to freak out.

16
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,100
Could you imagine that little robot head

17
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,210
popping out the top of your phone

18
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,250
and delivering messages like

19
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,207
hey you got to get up for school!

20
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:31,330
Can you give me a hint, Devan?

21
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,600
Can you fit this in your pocket?

22
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
- No, this could fit you in its pocket.

23
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,433
- What?

24
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:36,360
- Yeah.

25
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,193
- Devan, how would I actually buy this for you brother?

26
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:38,670
It's like a giant robot, so how about this,

27
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,350
I'm going to add in an extra element, Devan,

28
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,956
this is very important, this extra element has nothing

29
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:46,068
to do with the actual product itself, there we go, alright.

30
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:47,140
- [Devan] It's got to be some sort of face.

31
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,840
- [Collins] Yo, that thing is looking insane bro,

32
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,480
There is no taking pictures with this guy.

33
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,510
- He can't fit in the selfie.

34
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,710
- Oh!

35
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,315
Even with a selfie stick, he couldn't fit in the selfie?

36
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:55,148
- Definitely not.

37
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:55,981
(laughing)

38
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:56,814
- [Collins] All right, dude next up here we go

39
00:00:56,814 --> 00:00:57,647
we're going to add some details in the mind,

40
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:59,107
these are going to be very important.

41
00:00:59,107 --> 00:00:59,940
- He's got loaf of bread eyebrows.

42
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,773
I want to eat those eyebrows.

43
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:03,440
- Hold on guys, this just in, YouTube star Devan Key

44
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,300
admits to eating eyebrows.

45
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,930
Yes, this is very bizarre, but he has admitted

46
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,240
to eating eyebrows, back to you Patricia.

47
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,720
Your guy looks pretty aggressive, I've got to say.

48
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,010
He does not look like a friendly guy

49
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,450
you would want to meet in a dark alley way.

50
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,020
If this doesn't give it away, I don't know what will.

51
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,110
- Upside down P.

52
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,190
- Are you kidding me, Devan?

53
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,770
Dude how am I going to be able to buy that for you?

54
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,050
That's why your pancakes are better than mine bro

55
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,729
cause your always in my space, look at your elbow bro,

56
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:24,562
- [Devan] What?

57
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:25,440
- I have no room to move over here man.

58
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,491
- [Devan] I think you're over exaggerating

59
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:27,324
here a little bit.

60
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:28,270
- I am not. - You have enough space now?

61
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,648
- No, okay see. - How about now?

62
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:31,283
- I'm just going to get this little tooth right over here.

63
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:32,350
- Yeah. - I can still make a pancake like this though.

64
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,016
- That's actually really impressive

65
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:35,303
- Look! - [Collins] All right here we go we're going

66
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,136
to have to fill in these lovely teeth right over here.

67
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:37,370
- [Devan] Wait, dude does that guy have golden teeth?

68
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,740
- [Collins] No, he doesn't brush his teeth.

69
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,103
Yo, yours looks so amazing man!

70
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:42,790
I am so happy we're not choosing the pancake

71
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,640
off of which one looks better,

72
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,990
because that looks like your best one you've ever made dude.

73
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,060
I'll give you final hint about my guy, Devan.

74
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,900
- Okay.

75
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,210
- He's not a fan of pancakes in the morning,

76
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,070
he's making waffles.

77
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,210
- Donkey's not green.

78
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,330
- [Collins] You know who this is?

79
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,290
- [Devan] Yeah dude, it's Shrek.

80
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,150
- Then you've known this whole time this was Shrek?

81
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,310
Even though you're mainly using blue,

82
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,830
it's crazy how much depth you're able to achieve with that.

83
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,771
Where would you buy this?

84
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:01,604
(screeching)

85
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:02,437
- What? Did you touch it?

86
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:03,714
I told you not to get close to it.

87
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:04,663
- I'm sorry

88
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:06,010
- [Devan] Good thing it was on the chest

89
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,340
in a part that doesn't really matter.

90
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,173
Are those earmuffs?

91
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:10,030
Cause if they are why aren't they on his ears?

92
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,700
- Yeah I got to think about the anatomy of this.

93
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,040
- [Devan] Now it's time to fill in the background.

94
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,240
- Before we flip the pancakes it's time

95
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,447
to find out who buys what.

96
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:17,240
But if we're going off which pancake looks better,

97
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,530
I've read the comments, and apparently,

98
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,580
you guys don't think I would win.

99
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,070
So we have the coin of destiny.

100
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,280
Each side has one of our faces on it.

101
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,580
So right now it's time to flip the coin

102
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,298
and whoever's face lands on top, that person wins

103
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:27,460
and the other person has to buy whatever they drew.

104
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,384
So let's see who wins.

105
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:30,086
[In Unison] Three. Two. One.

106
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:30,919
(triumphant music)

107
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,752
(screaming)

108
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,570
Yes I won! Whew! - Yes, Dude!

109
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,403
- That's actually probably for the best.

110
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:35,363
- Yo, that is a huge relief bro,

111
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:37,079
cause could you imagine if I had to buy you a full blown man

112
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,540
But right now, it's time to flip the pancakes.

113
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,234
All right, here we go, time for the flip,

114
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:42,048
so you got to get up underneath it,

115
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,881
[In Unison] Oh boy.

116
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:43,758
Three. Two. One.

117
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:44,791
(triumphant music)

118
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,624
(screaming)

119
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,660
All right Devan, so this right here

120
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,040
is what you're going to be buying me.

121
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,010
- Dude, I have no clue.

122
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,370
- I can't wait to see what yours looks like, man.

123
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,211
Looks like there is a cheese filling around it right now.

124
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:53,340
- [Devan] Time to flip mine.

125
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,420
- [Collins] Dude, you are so close.

126
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,652
- [In Unison] Ready, set, go!

127
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:57,125
(triumphant music)

128
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,714
- [In Unison] Oh! Dude!

129
00:02:58,714 --> 00:02:59,547
- [Devan] What!

130
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:00,380
- [Collin] Devan, you're going to have to try to find

131
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,219
what I drew

132
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,320
and we'll find out if he does at the end of the video.

133
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,721
You challenged us to make our dream jewelry, so let's go.

134
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:06,554
I got to be very careful with mine,

135
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,460
because I really, really, really want this piece of jewelry.

136
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,670
- [Devan] Right now I'm adding the diamonds

137
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,010
and this is what makes mine extremely expensive.

138
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,870
- Is that a coffin?

139
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,703
- What? No.

140
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:15,050
- Do you want a luxury coffin, Devan?

141
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,510
Is that your ideal piece of jewelry?

142
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,022
- Yes, but that's not what this is.

143
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:19,570
- Dude, can you imagine a coffin with wheels,

144
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,606
but you roll up to the club,

145
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:22,990
and then resurrect yourself out of the coffin,

146
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,540
and then at the end of the night, you're dead tired,

147
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,640
so you lay back in your coffin and zoom off?

148
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,130
Oh my gosh, this is coming together man,

149
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,963
this is gonna work.

150
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,170
- [Devan] Dude these designs are crazy

151
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,590
- [Collins] Those two last little gems

152
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,490
are the most important.

153
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,060
- So there's gems on it?

154
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,670
- Ye- oh- maybe.

155
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,690
- [Devan] Now its time to fill it in.

156
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,730
- [Collins] Why does yours look gray now?

157
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,700
It looks pretty scary.

158
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,660
Now if we choose yours, I won't know what it is.

159
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,471
I might think you tried to make a basket, or a coffin.

160
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,890
- [Devan] Got to add some blue right here.

161
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,950
- [Collins] Boom! And there we go!

162
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,030
Mine is all done. Now I just got to let it cook,

163
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,300
and Devan are you almost done with yours?

164
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,370
- [Devan] I'm actually almost done!

165
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,930
- [Collin} That's looking really good for a party coffin.

166
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,520
We're going to be using the coin of destiny.

167
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,850
Each side has one of our faces on it.

168
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,990
So right now, I'm going to flip it,

169
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,980
and whichever side lands face up that's who wins.

170
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,900
So here we go, are you ready?

171
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,507
- [In Unison] Three. Two. One.

172
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,340
(triumphant music)

173
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,173
(screaming)

174
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:03,006
- Dude, oh my gosh! - What, no!

175
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:04,766
- I don't even know what that is!

176
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:05,737
- Oh dude it is that!

177
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:06,808
- [Collins] Oh it is super expensive.

178
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:07,825
All right, well here we go, time to flip mine.

179
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:08,658
Hopefully, the moment it flips over

180
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:09,491
you'll know exactly what it is.

181
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:11,327
- [In Unison] Three. Two. One.

182
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,160
(triumphant music)

183
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,033
(screaming)

184
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:13,866
- [In Unison] Oh!

185
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,017
- [Devan] Wait a second!

186
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:16,155
- No!

187
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:16,988
- What!

188
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:17,821
- What!

189
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:18,654
- I moved it and it wrecked it a smidge so here we go,

190
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:19,487
hold on, we got to lift it up, oh my gosh.

191
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:20,320
- [Devan] You did a really good job though.

192
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,153
- No!

193
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:21,986
- [Devan] It looks actually really cool.

194
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:22,819
- [Collin] Pay close attention to what you think

195
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:23,652
it could be.

196
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:25,640
- I gotcha.

197
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,940
- Dude, this is gonna look insane

198
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,312
when you actually flip it bro.

199
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:29,145
- Oh!

200
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:30,039
I can't wait to see what it is,

201
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:30,872
and I'm very happy I don't have to buy it,

202
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:31,705
cause it looks super expensive.

203
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,270
[In Unison] Three. Two. Oh wait!

204
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,130
- Three second like challenge!

205
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,520
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.

206
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,353
Are you ready?

207
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:38,186
Here we go,

208
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:40,630
[In Unison] Three, two, one. Done.

209
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,516
Ready, set, go.

210
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,349
(triumphant music)

211
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,182
(screaming)

212
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:45,150
- [Collin] Oh my gosh

213
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,230
You can comment down below how

214
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,150
much money is Devan going to spend when he buys this

215
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,680
and we'll find out at the end of the video.

216
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
You challenged us to make our favorite fashion items,

217
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,433
so let's go.

218
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,266
All right, here we go, gonna start out

219
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,400
with this shape of mine, so we're gonna go here.

220
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,290
- [Devan] I've kind of made it a little far in mine.

221
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,100
- [Collin] And then we go up and then we go over

222
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,522
and then down like that.

223
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:00,355
(laughing)

224
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:02,050
- [Collin] These aren't Yeezys Devan, they're Keezys.

225
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,883
- Oh!

226
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:03,716
(laughing)

227
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:04,549
- Key bro special right here.

228
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:05,382
- Whoa, don't drag me into this dude.

229
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:06,610
I think I'm going to go for some details now.

230
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,860
- [Collin] And now it's time to fill it in with color

231
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,672
and this is really where mine starts to comes life man.

232
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:11,038
This is really going to look amazing.

233
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:11,871
- Really? All right.

234
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:12,704
- Oh abso-flipping-lutely dude.

235
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:15,180
If you try to buy this thing man it might max out your Visa.

236
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,034
I've got a vision in my mind, and it looks good.

237
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:18,900
(screaming)

238
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,733
Oh, no!

239
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,120
For the liquid man, I gotta dab it up real quick

240
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,269
see if I can fix it, okay here we go

241
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:23,102
- [Devan] Oh dude what did you do?

242
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:23,935
- [Collin] Now that I'm looking at it I think it might

243
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:24,768
be a shoe?

244
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:27,040
But it's a very specific shoe that I'm looking for.

245
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,300
- [Devan] Here we go, just gonna add some blue

246
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,730
back in over here like this.

247
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,718
- [Collin] A blue heel I've heard is very important

248
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:32,140
on a shoe.

249
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,432
- From who?

250
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:34,265
- I hear it from all the designers.

251
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:35,739
Devan, trust me when you go to

252
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:37,060
the store you'll know exactly what to buy.

253
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,700
- Which store though? That's very general.

254
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,286
- [Collin] I'll have to give you a hint

255
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:41,119
for the store somewhere in this.

256
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:41,952
Does that does not make any sense?

257
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:42,785
- It's like two keys?

258
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:44,064
- No. You know what store this is.

259
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:44,897
- Chanel

260
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:46,220
- [Collin] No. In what world is that a C Devan?

261
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,053
- [Devan] Crocs!

262
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:47,886
- You are not buying me Crocs.

263
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:49,420
- [Devan] Well you should know what mine is by now, right?

264
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,253
- [Collins] Yeah, it's a robe.

265
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:51,560
- No, no, it's a very specific robe.

266
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,393
- [Collins] Oh its a Snuggie!

267
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,332
- [Devan] No, it's like five times the price of a Snuggie,

268
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:54,973
dude.

269
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:56,200
- A snuggie is like 29 bucks.

270
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,443
- Maybe, I didn't know how much Snuggies were.

271
00:05:59,348 --> 00:06:00,181
- How much do you think a Snuggie is?

272
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:01,014
- I don't know, like 150 bucks

273
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:02,330
- Man, what kind of Snuggies have you been ripped off by?

274
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,289
Before we flip, it's time to find out who buys what,

275
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:04,426
so we've got the coin of destiny right now.

276
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:07,110
Here we go, just gonna give it a flip, three, two, one

277
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,070
and whichever side lands face up,

278
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,790
the other person has to buy whatever was drawn.

279
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,623
So here we go,

280
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:13,038
[In Unison] three, two, one.

281
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:13,871
(triumphant music) (screaming)

282
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:16,180
- I won, oh yes! - Oh man, I wanted my robe!

283
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,380
- You're going to have to buy me these shoes!

284
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,425
- [Devan] It was a Versace robe!

285
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:20,566
- [Collin] What! - [Devan] Yeah it was Versace!

286
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:21,490
- Yo that would've been super expensive.

287
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,910
All right here we go, time to flip mine man,

288
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,930
and when I reveal it, dude,

289
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,470
I'm hoping this is going to be my best pancake yet.

290
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,036
Three, two, one.

291
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:28,952
(triumphant music)

292
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:30,223
Oh no!

293
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,580
Well the leg, the leg just kind of fell apart.

294
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,510
Dude, I think I nailed the shoe from every level.

295
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,747
- [Devan] Yeah man.

296
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:37,336
All right here we go, here we go, here we go,

297
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:39,380
coming underneath, oh yes, all right pull it, pull it

298
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,760
pull it, side, side, side, side, side, side

299
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,824
Team work makes the dream work!

300
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,300
- Where?

301
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,717
- I thought it was going to be screwed up for sure

302
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:46,332
- Nice!

303
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:47,355
Now it's time to flip.

304
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:48,449
Ready, set, go!

305
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,282
(triumphant music)

306
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:50,723
- [Collins] That looks like a very high end Snuggie!

307
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:51,623
- It's not a Snuggie dude!

308
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:53,170
- [Collins] You get to comment down below

309
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,060
what store you think Devan will be able to buy this at,

310
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,190
we'll be finding out if he's able

311
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,150
to find the exact shoe at the end of the video.

312
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,100
You challenged us to make our dream gaming equipment,

313
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,933
so let's go.

314
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,300
To kick mine off I'm starting with a shape,

315
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,296
- Wait

316
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:04,129
so here we go, so it's going to go up and around like this.

317
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,013
- [Devan] What are you making?

318
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:07,320
(screaming)

319
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,180
- That's not good.

320
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,540
I'm trying to play with perspective on this one,

321
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,670
get a little bit more artsy

322
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,720
but it looks like a very sad porpoise man.

323
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,450
This is his tail and his head (wailing).

324
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,285
All of his friends swam away with him,

325
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:17,820
he's like but guys I can't swim as fast.

326
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,900
All right, next up here, time to give my guy some detail.

327
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,780
So this is really where I think it's going to start

328
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,624
to bring it together-

329
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:23,457
- Wait your guy, so you're making a guy?

330
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:24,453
- I didn't say that.

331
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,045
- [Devan] Do you have any guesses as to what mine is?

332
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:27,878
- [Collin] I think yours is a man wearing

333
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:28,711
some insane wrist bangles on him, Devan.

334
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:30,650
Could you imagine a guy, like a classical concert,

335
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,920
and everyone's like oh what a beautiful set

336
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,008
and he's like

337
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:34,109
[In Unison] Ahh hey hey hey hey!

338
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:34,942
(metal music)

339
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:35,775
- I love it!

340
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,800
Does he have a piece of lettuce going across his torso?

341
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,700
- [Devon] He does, he just recently went vegan.

342
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,420
- [Collin] I'm going to add some extra elements around it.

343
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,404
- [Devon] Okay.

344
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:43,542
- [Collin] So here we go-

345
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:44,375
- Two bowling balls!

346
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,208
- Alright so next up we are going to use some white-

347
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,127
Look at that directly to the center of the face.

348
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:47,510
- Oh geez

349
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,110
- It has to do with what this is.

350
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,173
- Light saber boy.

351
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:51,006
- [Collin] (scoffs) What?

352
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:52,437
Alright I'm going to add a very distinct symbol here Devan,

353
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,473
and this should really get you going on what this is.

354
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,663
What does that look like?

355
00:07:55,663 --> 00:07:56,496
- [Devan] It's a spider.

356
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:57,656
- Yeah!

357
00:07:57,656 --> 00:07:58,489
Okay!

358
00:07:58,489 --> 00:07:59,502
You're getting close!

359
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:00,417
- Yeah, but why is it white?

360
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:01,250
That's a telly tubby, dude, that's not a spider anymore.

361
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,410
- [Collin] I got to say man your guys got a super flowy cape

362
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,350
for shooting gas!

363
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,260
Its how you can tell every time he shoots gas,

364
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,690
cause his cape will go flutter flutter flutter.

365
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,880
- [Devan] All right now I'm just filling it in.

366
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,713
- [Collin] Next up, here we go,

367
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:11,138
I'm going to add some contouring to mine here at the bottom.

368
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:12,930
Which should really give it shape.

369
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,860
- OH! Nice artwork.

370
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,693
- Oh, thank you.

371
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:15,730
I thought you were about to say nice this!

372
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,041
Cause I need you to guess this!

373
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:17,960
You went pink on the cape?

374
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,043
- [Devan] It's on the highlight, so he's got a little bit

375
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:20,410
of a purplish pink cape.

376
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,243
- [Collin] All right here we go.

377
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:22,097
We're going to add some finishing touches to mine.

378
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:23,560
All right now we got all the lines down

379
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,400
so we gotta fill it in right now.

380
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,820
So first of all got to fill in my little dudes over here.

381
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,970
He's wrapped in a blanket Devan, just a little sleeping bag.

382
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,803
Okay!

383
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:32,350
He's just trying to enjoy a night when this character

384
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,810
shot things out of his hands to grab his face!

385
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,643
Oh my gosh!

386
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:36,476
- Is that a clue?

387
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:37,585
- Yes, that was a huge, that was the clue Devan.

388
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,410
That was a huge clue!

389
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,650
- Oh, I have no clue what it is.

390
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,483
- Oh my gosh.

391
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:42,510
Finishing touches are done on mine.

392
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,870
Now its just time to cook it, let it roast.

393
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,040
And wait for this to finish.

394
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,420
- [Devon] One last spot right here and done.

395
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,650
- Before we flip the pancakes its time to find out

396
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,483
who buys what.

397
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,094
So we've got the coin of destiny and remember whichever

398
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:53,099
face lands up that's the person who wins,

399
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,540
and the other brother is going shopping.

400
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,650
Lets see who the winner is, here we go.

401
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,402
- [In Unison] Three, two, one.

402
00:08:58,402 --> 00:08:59,303
(screaming)

403
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:00,136
- Yeah!

404
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:00,969
- What?

405
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:01,802
- I win, I win.

406
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:02,635
- Good for you, good for you.

407
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:03,468
- Okay Devan, this is very important,

408
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:04,520
you have to know what this is to buy me the right game.

409
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,640
- [Devan] I have no clue dude!

410
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,710
- Oh, okay well maybe when I flip it,

411
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,570
it will become more apparent.

412
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,559
- [In Unison] Three, two, one.

413
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,870
(screaming)

414
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,110
- Okay, Devan, focus.

415
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,800
- [Devan] When I go shopping I'll try to figure it out.

416
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,970
But now it's time to flip mine.

417
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,803
- [Collin] This one is going to look insane bro.

418
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:18,150
I think this is one of your best pancakes you've ever done!

419
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,983
- [Devan] Oh yes!

420
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:19,910
All right, all right, all right.

421
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,899
- [Collin] Oh my god!

422
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:21,732
All right Devan you're doing great.

423
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:22,565
You're doing great.

424
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:23,450
- You know what, I think might need to stand up for this.

425
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,470
- [In Unison] Three, two, one.

426
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,303
- Oh, oh, oh, wait!

427
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,136
- Oh yeah!

428
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:26,969

436
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:41,224
(triumphant music)

437
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:42,116
(screaming)

438
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,173
- What!

439
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:44,006
That looks so good bro!

440
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:46,141
- [Devan] If you didn't get it,

441
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:46,974
its Mysterio from Spider man: Far from home.

442
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:48,190
- All right Devan its time for you to go shopping.

443
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,688
You get to comment down below what do you think he's going

444
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:52,521
to buy.

445
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:53,460
Hopefully its exactly what I drew out of pancake batter.

446
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,320
We will be finding out at the end of the video.

447
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
You challenged us to make our favorite movie character,

448
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,993
so lets go!

449
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:59,071
I'm going to start with a large [Inaudible] Right here.

450
00:09:59,071 --> 00:09:59,940
IT looks more like Patrick's star.

451
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,930
Did you give her a mustache?

452
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,416
- [Devan] No, no. It won't be a mustache I promise.

453
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,660
All right next up, I'm doing the hand.

454
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,240
- [Collin] My pancake really comes all down to detail.

455
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,480
I think I am crushing it right now.

456
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,820
- [Devan] This next part should give it away

457
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,070
if you haven't gotten it already.

458
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,721
Who do you think it is?

459
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:13,250
- Tell me if I am right Devan, I think it is (whispers)

460
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,919
- He just whispered in my ear (mumbles)

461
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,940
- If you don't know who this character is,

462
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,270
you probably don't know movies.

463
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,270
That's a lot to say.

464
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:22,170
IM going to take that back, that whole sentence (eating)

465
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,419
We're going to put that away.

466
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:24,252
(throwing up)

467
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:25,207
Its now gone.

468
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,040
- [Devon] All right now just going to add a line

469
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,042
right over here.

470
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:27,875
- [Collin] Going to fill in these large pink things

471
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,550
on the side of his head, which may or may not be ears.

472
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,770
Oh my gosh yours comes along so fast.

473
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,280
- [Devon] Right now I am reinforcing lines I made earlier

474
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,998
so that the pancake flips better.

475
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:38,330
- [Collin] So just going to start filling in the pancake,

476
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,300
but there's still a couple extra elements to add.

477
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,660
- [Devan] Right now I am doing her face diamonds.

478
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,770
- [Collin] You call them face diamonds,

479
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,180
I call them grills Devon.

480
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,130
I think you gave her some grills on her forehead.

481
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,584
This looks like an assortment of food man.

482
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:49,455
You've got the arm burger,

483
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:50,288
you got a little bit of ketchup here.

484
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,121
Looks really cool though man.

485
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:52,763
The colors are all so vibrant on yours.

486
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:53,596
I can't wait to see what it looks like

487
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:54,429
when you flip it over.

488
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:55,723
- [Devan] Same.

489
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:56,983
Now its time to fill in her multi tool.

490
00:10:58,038 --> 00:10:58,871
- [Collin] Maybe its one tool, cause it only does one thing.

491
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:00,013
- Do you know what it is?

492
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:00,846
- Can I take a guess with sound effects?

493
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:01,679
(sings)

494
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,124
- Oh no, not really.

495
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:04,166
- Is it-

496
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,011
(Shoots and sings)

497
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,072
- Not quite.

498
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:06,905
Your guy has gotten really crusty.

499
00:11:06,905 --> 00:11:07,960
- [Collin] Well yeah, cause I am waiting for you bro.

500
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,640
You are taking forever, and you know what?

501
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,490
I will join him in crusty solitude.

502
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,440
- Oh, oh wow.

503
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,700
So that's crusty Collin?

504
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,870
- I've always been crusty, I just used lotion.

505
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,530
So why is it white on the inside?

506
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,363
That kinda throws me off,

507
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:20,990
cause I thought I knew what that was but why is it white?

508
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,823
- [Devan] You shall see.

509
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:23,500
- Maybe you're making a giant stick of string cheese.

510
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,880
- [Devan] Got to add the green light rays around it.

511
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,770
- [Collin] Looks like like a tea,

512
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,180
like a matcha tea or something.

513
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,013
- [Devan] Mine is done!

514
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:30,150
Now its time to let it roast and flip.

515
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,530
- [Collin] I can not wait to see how these look.

516
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,046
Before we flip the pancakes its time to find out

517
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:33,910
who buys what.

518
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,267
We have the coin of destiny.

519
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:36,289
I'm going to flip it up in the air and which ever side

520
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:39,613
lands face up, that is the winner and the other person

521
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:41,210
has to buy whatever they drew.

522
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,043
So here's the reveal.

523
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:43,266
You ready?

524
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,099
- [In Unison] Three, two, one.

525
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:44,932
(triumphant music)

526
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:45,765
(screaming)

527
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:46,598
- Oh what!I have to buy that for you?

528
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:47,431
All right, so Devon won.

529
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:50,154
- [IN Unison] Three, two, one.

530
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:51,125
(triumphant music)

531
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:51,958
(screaming)

532
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:52,791
- Nice flip!

533
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,689
- I nailed it, art is on fleek.

534
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:55,997
Dude it's Pumba from the new Lion King movie.

535
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:57,319
- [Devan] Now its time to flip the pancake.

536
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:58,373
- And that thing is going to look crazy man.

537
00:11:58,373 --> 00:11:59,206
Here we go!

538
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:00,460
- [In Unison] Three, two-

539
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,293
oh, oh, wait!

540
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:02,400
- You want to win a fifteen minute video call

541
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,280
with Devan and I text the word DRAW to 81800 right now.

542
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,700
So pause the video, and text the word DRAW to 81800.

543
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,170
You'll automatically be entered to win,

544
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,270
and lets see how this looks.

545
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,875
- [In Unison] Ready, set, go!

546
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,932
(triumphant music)

547
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,010
(screaming)

548
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,884
- OH my god,

549
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:18,646
that is the greatest pancake you have ever made Devan.

550
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:19,710
(claps) Wow!

551
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,500
Because Devon won the coin toss its time for me to go out

552
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,380
and buy what he drew,

553
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,504
and we'll be finding out what I buy at the end of the video.

554
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:25,492
(bell rings)

555
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:26,470
- You challenged us to make our dream super car.

556
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,303
Lets go!

557
00:12:27,303 --> 00:12:29,820
Starting off with my car, it's got a very distinct shape.

558
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,270
So, I hope you guess what it is.

559
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,350
I don't know what that is, its a burger!

560
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,460
It's two patties!

561
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,530
You know what, you've been winning most of the coin flips

562
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,123
so I really hope I win.

563
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,300
Already Devan, so what is this that I am making?

564
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,240
What do you think this is?

565
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,982
- You are making a smaller loaf of bread!

566
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:48,990
- [Collin] I am making myself in a matching shirt to my car.

567
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,890
This is me on the inside, self portrait dawg.

568
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,490
- [Devan] Looks like you put like cheese on your head!

569
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,770
- [Collin] You know what, I'm done with conversation bro.

570
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,458
You're not even in reality right now.

571
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,420
So I'm going to fill my face in as red,

572
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,450
because a lot happens when I laugh,

573
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,283
which is kinda just in general,

574
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:00,670
my face gets very red very often.

575
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,210
There's a new arm right here Devan.

576
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,068
This arm is-

577
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:03,901
- Your arm is really really high,

578
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:04,840
no he's waving get out the way!

579
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,870
- [Collin] He's got a brochure for the car!

580
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,670
- [Devon] Instead of focusing on the brochure duty,

581
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,760
you should focus on the actual car!

582
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,240
- Oh, the head lights are very distinctive,

583
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,120
they go like this, and like this.

584
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,140
- And then like that!

585
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,573
- Close enough!

586
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:18,406
Wait, why are you're windows blue?

587
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,560
It looks like your car is underwater right now!

588
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,360
- It's suppose to be like reflecting the blue sky.

589
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,690
What car have wheels that pop out like that?

590
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,619
- [Collin] It makes a lot of sense,

591
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:26,620
if you really think about it.

592
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,453
Like hard.

593
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:28,690
- [Devan] Now for the yellow break caliper.

594
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,960
- [Collin] Oh snap!

595
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,191
Now you maybe asking yourself Devan,

596
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:32,369
[In Unison]

597
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,202
- [Collin] where are all the door handles?

598
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:34,580
- [Devan] What is that?

599
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,413
- What?

600
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:36,246
- No, no. I'm going to draw a very special someone in here.

601
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:37,574
All right, I'll give you a hint.

602
00:13:37,574 --> 00:13:38,407
- [Devan] Wait what?

603
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:39,350
Do they have their hands on the dash?

604
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,933
- [Collin] They're holding on for dear life like

605
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,443
(speed tunnel)

606
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:43,276
- [Devan] Is your car used?

607
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:44,120
- [Collin] Our nan says that its actually better to buy

608
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,030
a used car Devan, cause when you drive it off the lot

609
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,269
it looses a lot of its value off the bat.

610
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,870
Depreciating assets.

611
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,703
- [In Unison] Yeah!

612
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,620
- Financial jokes

613
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,477
We're doing all blue interior and sky.

614
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:54,400
I want my interior to match the sky.

615
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,900
You don't know if your looking straight at the sky

616
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,327
or into my interior.

617
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:59,471
Before we flip the pancakes it is time to find out

618
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,730
who is getting their dream car.

619
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,650
To do this we have the coin of destiny.

620
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,850
So right now time to flip up,

621
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,980
whichever side is face up,

622
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,833
that is who is getting their dream car.

623
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,380
- [In Unison] Three, Two, One.

624
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,538
(triumphant music)

625
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:09,498
(screaming)

626
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:10,944
- Yes, dude!

627
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:11,889
Yes, you are going to buy me that.

628
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:12,886
- OH my gosh Devan,

629
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,268
all right better hope I can figure what this car is.

630
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:16,875
- Dude you better be able to!

631
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,800
- All right so here we go.

632
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,060
For mine he is going to get the spatula underneath.

633
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,359
Oh, no no no!

634
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,100
Oh, no I'll replace the door a little bit later.

635
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,933
Okay here we go

636
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:25,300
- [IN Unison] Three, two, one

637
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,750
- Wait why'd you go so far?

638
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,839
- Bam, there we go!

639
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,312
(triumphant music)

640
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:30,145
(screaming)

641
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:31,690
- You lost your door!

642
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,989
- Mine is ready to flip, just got to get underneath it.

643
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:35,390
- You got to us your pancake reference imagine

644
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,350
when I'm looking through these different cars.

645
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,530
- [Devan] Yeah what ever you got to do.

646
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,251
- [ In Unison] Ready, set, go.

647
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:40,089
(triumphant music)

648
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:41,438
(screaming)

649
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:42,271
- [Collin] Oh my gosh!

650
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:43,344
- [Devan] I did it!

651
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:44,177
Do you know what it is?

652
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:45,010
Do you know what it is?

653
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,141
- [Collin] I think I know what it is!

654
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:46,974
- What is it?

655
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:47,807
- Well I can't tell you,

656
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,640
I have to surprise you with what I actually end up

657
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,984
getting at the dealership.

658
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:50,817
- Don't prank me!

659
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:51,650
- [Collin] Comment down below what your dream car is.

660
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,455
Right now its time to go shopping.

661
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:56,160
(pop music)

662
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,463
- Yo, dude forget about Devin's car bro!

663
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,635
This is the one that I drew.

664
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:02,135
(funky music)

665
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:05,790
- This nitga is the exact same one he made out of a pancake.

666
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,623
Oh my god.

667
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:08,072
- And remember the door.

668
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:09,720
- Yo! What!

669
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,780
- I'm sure I can come up with a unique situation

670
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,880
for him to have the car.

671
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,580
- I really appreciate it man, thank you.

672
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,413
- Absolutely.

673
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,415
- Here you go man,

674
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,248
here's the contract.

675
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:18,100
- All right, dude I cannot believe were about to do this.

676
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,409
But here we go!

677
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,242
(funky music)

678
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:21,580
- Devan is never going to believe this bro.

679
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,610
This is awesome!

680
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,080
Where is the handle for the door?

681
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,740
Back from shopping, we've got all the gifts.

682
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,573
- [Devan] Dude, I can't wait to see if you actually

683
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:28,310
got me a car!

684
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,560
- [Collin] Yup, one thing I forgot to buy is sunscreen bro.

685
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,234
I got absolutely torched bro!

686
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:33,338
- You got really torched.

687
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:34,171
- I got roasted man.

688
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:36,330
Its the beginning of summer and I look like a lobster.

689
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,220
You get sun burnt as well?

690
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,228
Comment down below lobster squad

691
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,020
so I know its not just me bro.

692
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,183
All right Devan so lets start off with this right here.

693
00:15:42,183 --> 00:15:44,420
I really want to see if you were able to get what this was.

694
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,450
- [Devan] It took me awhile to kinda interpre-late

695
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,113
what was going on but I think I got it.

696
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,200
- Interpre-late?

697
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,033
- Isn't that right?

698
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,550
So I wasn't able to find you some deeds,

699
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,038
but I did find you some Beats!

700
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:54,947
(triumphant music)

701
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:55,780
- Hey, yo and they are red bro!

702
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,030
This so fun and it matches my neck!

703
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,870
You can't even tell, it looks like color coordination.

704
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,690
Yo, I'm super excited about this man.

705
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,800
Thank you so much. You nailed it!

706
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,320

708
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:07,907

709
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:08,740
- No way!

710
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,573
- I really got that one.

711
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:10,406
- You got that one?

712
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:11,239
- We're going to wait on that one.

713
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,072
First lets go to this thing over here.

714
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:12,905
- [Collin] Aww, the suspense is building.

715
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,497
- Three, two, one.

716
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:15,643
(Triumphant music)

717
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:16,476
- Ta-da!

718
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,477
- No way, bro no way!

00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,056
It's from the right store!

720
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:19,889
All right, here we go.

721
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:20,722
I'm going to open up.

722
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:21,555
Three, two, one!

723
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:22,388
- Oh!

724
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:23,347
- Sorry hold on, there's packaging.

725
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:24,447
- Beautiful packaging.

726
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:26,791
- No way!

727
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,602
(triumphant music)

728
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:29,435
You found the exact shoes bro.

00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:30,268
- I got it.

730
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:31,610

731
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,630
I could absolutely thing of.

732
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,190
Something you never be able to find and buy.

00:16:41,196 --> 00:16:42,029
- Thank yo so much man.

740
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:42,862
Ow, ow sunburn, sunburn man.

No pat, no pat.

742
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,010
And now time for your first gift.

743
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,010
You ready?

744
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,843
What do you think it's going to be?

745
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:48,833
- I really hoping it's the car.

746
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,690
- Well you're going to have to wait just a little bit

747
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,840
to find out about the car.

748
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,219
But Devan I've got the perfect gift for you.

749
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:54,080
- Oh the anticipation!

750
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,369
- Three, two, one.

751
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:57,202
(screaming)

752
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:58,420
- What? Light sabers?

753
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,770
- [Devan] I wanted the arm bangles dude.

754
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,898
- [Collin] What?

755
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:02,330
You wanted the arm bangles?

756
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,640
- Yeah, she has a cool belt too.

757
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,897
- The belt is at like the very bottom.

758
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:05,890
- I'm just kidding with you dude.

759
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,753
I like these, these are awesome.

760
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:09,030
- Also the thing is Devan I wanted to go above and beyond

761
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,050
for you so they're not just normal light sabers.

762
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,366
Click that little button on the back.

763
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,616
- [In Unison] Whoa, dude!

764
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,551
- I got you two- whooa!

765
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:17,384
They are a little bit finicky.

766
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:19,290
Congratulations bro, you've got some legit light sabers.

767
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,020
All right Devan so I think its time for the big gift

768
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,853
right now.

769
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:22,686
- Oh nope, nope. Not that.

770
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:23,530
Its time for this.

771
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,860
- All right I mean I am excited for that too.

772
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,693
So I can't wait to see.

773
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:27,661

774
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:28,544
(triumphant music)

775
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:29,377
- Ta-da!

776
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:30,210
- Wait, no way bro!

777
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,310
The spider man one of everything.

778
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,200
Dude, that is spun on bro.

779
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,033
Thank you so much man.

780
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:34,866
- [Devan] You got it.

781
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:35,840
Time for your big gift.

782
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,673
You ready for this one?

783
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:38,110
- Oh my gosh, I am so ready.

784
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,700
If you got this right this will be my birthday present

785
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,060
for like the next like five years man.

786
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,500
- It is a watch, right.

787
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,333
- Yeah!

788
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,691
- Close your eyes, close your eyes.

789
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:45,524
- All right were gonna close my eyes.

790
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:46,357
- And just put our your arm.

791
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,190
- And if you got it right bro,

792
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,350
I am going to lose my mind.

793
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,638
- Three, two, one.

794
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:51,660
- [Collin] What?

795
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,544
- [Devan] How is it?

796
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:53,390
- [Collin] Its not quite the latching mechanism

797
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,223
I thought it would be.

798
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:55,200
Kinda stung a little bit.

799
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,033
Can I feel it?

800
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,477
- Yeah, yeah, you ready?

801
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:58,419
- [Collin] Doesn't feel right.

802
00:17:58,419 --> 00:17:59,252
- [Devan] Go for it.

803
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:00,085
There you go?

804
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:00,918
(laughter)

805
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:01,751
- That's not what it is?

806
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:02,940
- No, its a rainbow Rolex Devan!

807
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,210
It's got the crown, the rainbow jewels around it.

808
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,640
Although I appreciate the gesture Devan,

809
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,670
I can't be wearing this around.

810
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,810
I got nothing against Hello Kitty,

811
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,900
Its just not quite my style.

812
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,040
Going to put that off to the side.

813
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,980
All right Devan so its not its time for your big one.

814
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,610
- Yeah, been kinda wondering why the whole car is missing

815
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,840
and just the tire.

816
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,010
- The reason is because I took your pancake around

817
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,250
as like a shopping list with me.

818
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,780
I went to a lot of different places because I had

819
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,970
to find the exact same car that you drew.

820
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,630
- Dude, no way!

821
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,800
- I don't want to blow the surprise, so here we go Devan.

822
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,470
I have a blind fold right here.

823
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,923
- All right I am ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.

824
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:33,756
- So we got the blind fold here.

825
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:34,589
Going to pop it on like this.

826
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,490
If I can figure out how to tie this.

827
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,000
- Its sliding around, what are you doing?

828
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,270
- I untied it.

829
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,663
- It's in my mouth.

830
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:41,496
What are you doing?

831
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,329
- I'm just trying to tie it.

832
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,162
- You're not pulling in the right direction.

833
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:43,995
- I am sorry (laughs)

834
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:45,210
All right Devan its time for you to get up right now

835
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,330
and find out where I got my sunburn today.

836
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,750
So lets go!

837
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,401
All right Devan so keep walking forward.

838
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:51,615
- Okay.

839
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:52,448
- Just like that.

840
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:53,281
- Dude what is going on?

841
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:54,880
I swear there's going to be some sort of toy car,

842
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,713
or some sort of prank.

843
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:58,000
- All right stand right there, face just like that.

844
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,789
On the count of three you're going to remove the blindfold.

845
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:02,650
Three, two, one.

846
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,140
- What, no way!

847
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,660
Holy cow!

848
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,830
This is like exactly what I drew.

849
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,663
- Come here man.

850
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:10,496
- OH my!

851
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:13,580
I mean look at this, oh man!

852
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,413
(laughs)

853
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:16,030
- Oh dude, I totally forgot its actually a convertible bro.

854
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,863
- Can I get in it?

855
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,070
- Yeah bro, I mean its yours!

856
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,050
- No way. All right

857
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,792
oh, I don't want to mess anything up.

858
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,760
Oh my goodness.

859
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,593
- You got to shut the door.

860
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:24,820
- Dude it fits so perfectly!

861
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,970
- There is one catch.

862
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:26,803
- Its not my car?

863
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:28,610
- It is your car, for 24 hours.

864
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,443
- Oh what?

865
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:31,070
Dude, all right. Ill take that!

866
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,350
I thought you were going to say its not my car at all,

867
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,040

868

(screaming)

873
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:42,242
- [Collin] Dude its like a dragon!

874
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:43,687
- It sounds so good bro!

875
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:44,520

- All right here we go.

879
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:48,093

880
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:49,103
- Trust me dude, I will be very safe.

881
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:52,140
- You've got 24 hours man have some fun bro.

00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:54,450
- Dude this is insane!

884
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,850
