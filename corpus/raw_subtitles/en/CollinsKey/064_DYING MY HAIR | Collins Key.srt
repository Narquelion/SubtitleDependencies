1
00:00:00,891 --> 00:00:01,932
- What's up guys?

2
00:00:01,932 --> 00:00:04,661
It is Collins Key, and welcome to the Thursday Vlog.

3
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:06,752
That's by far my favorite intro I've ever done ever

4
00:00:06,752 --> 00:00:07,920
ever to a Thursday Vlog.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,503
(techno music)

6
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:13,288
Now, for today's video I want to do something

7
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:15,471
that I haven't done in quite awhile,

8
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:17,425
and also I'd love for you guys to find out new, cool,

9
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:18,600
and fun things about me.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,640
Today I'm going to be doing a "Ask Collins Key."

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,473
(whoosh sound)

12
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:24,038
And you guys sent me a ton of questions with the

13
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:27,456
#askcollinskey, and we actually trended worldwide,

14
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:28,667
which is absolutely insane.

15
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,899
Power to the keypers. You guys are amazing.

16
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,810
And reading off all the questions for you guys is

17
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,076
gonna be my alter ego Joseph.

18
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,651
"Are you the real Slim Shady?"

19
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:38,001
I think the question really should be

20
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,252
"Will the real Slim Shady please stand up."

21
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:41,085
(hip hop music)

22
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,675
"Uh. I'm gonna stand up cause I'm the real Slim Shady y'all.

23
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:44,508
Oh. Oh."

24
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:48,716
Just kidding Dad. It's me, Joseph.

25
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:49,852
Ha. Swag.

26
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,799
"How excited are you for Christmas?"

27
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,412
Yeah. Woo. Woo hoo.

28
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:55,212
Oh yeah. Woo.

29
00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:56,951
Turn it up. It's a Christmas tree.

30
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:59,593
I found, a Christmas tree.

31
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:00,426
So, yeah.

32
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:01,259
I guess you could say I'm a little bit

33
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:02,092
excited for Christmas.

34
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:03,298
"Are you a night person or morning person?"

35
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:05,506
Well, that one's easy. I'm definitely a night person.

36
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:06,339
"If you were a burger,

37
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:08,013
what part of the burger would you be?"

38
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:10,641
The most important part. The buns.

39
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:12,899
"Sum up life in one sentence."

40
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:13,732
Waffles.

41
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:19,574
That's a pancake, and it's frozen. Perfect. (chuckles)

42
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:20,962
"Are you going to release a magic video soon."

43
00:01:20,962 --> 00:01:23,343
Yes. There's gonna be a ton of new magic videos comin

44
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:25,699
out very soon, and I kind of want to take a little bit

45
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:27,995
of time to refresh my material so I can bring you guys

46
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:31,663
new magic with new people and new, crazy reactions.

47
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:34,025
Hit the thumbs up button if you guys are excited for

48
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:35,965
a lot more magic videos comin up in the new year.

49
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:38,000
"Have you ever picked your nose in public?"

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,223
Probably, when I was a little kid.

51
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:41,491
But, the one time where I got called out on it,

52
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:43,172
like I was in a class and the teacher was all like

53
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:44,516
"Collins. Stop picking your nose."

54
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:47,004
And I was just like, "Huh?"

55
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:48,028
"Do you curse?"

56
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:51,946
No flipping way. I don't use freaking gosh dang cuss words.

57
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:52,795
I keep it clean.

58
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:56,624
You know, I'm all like "Mustard on the beat, yo."

59
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:58,344
"Can I hug attack you if I ever get to meet you?"

60
00:01:58,344 --> 00:01:59,398
Yeah, for sure, like whenever you guys meet me feel

61
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:01,441
free to like jump, tackle, hug me.

62
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:02,427
It's really fun and...

63
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:04,198
Yeah. I just love meeting you guys in general.

64
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:06,965
"Justin Timberlake concert or Eminem concert?"

65
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,042
I love both of these artists, but if I had to choose,

66
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,012
I would probably pick an Eminem concert because

67
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:14,148
"I'm the real Slim Shady yo." (hip hop music)

68
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:15,874
Just kidding guys. It's still Joseph.

69
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:16,730
Swag. (giggles)

70
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,147
"How many times do you blink a day?"

71
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:20,898
Well, during the day I don't think I blink that much,

72
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:22,586
but if I had to guess I would have to say maybe like

73
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:24,381
5 or 6 times during the day.

74
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:26,543
"Can you say yes to this question?"

75
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:27,840
Um, sure. Yeah.

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,455
I will not answer this question. That's a no.

77
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:32,115
"I really wanted to watch your live streaming magic

78
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:34,121
show, but I am so broke."

79
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,619
The live streaming magic show was so much fun.

80
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:37,669
It was insane.

81
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:39,235
And I'm definitely planning on doing a lot more

82
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:41,268
of those coming up here in the new year.

83
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:43,312
And I was really bummed to find out that some of you guys

84
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:44,885
couldn't make it to the show because you guys said

85
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:45,718
you had no money.

86
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:48,306
So, afterwards I spent quite awhile researching and

87
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:50,900
trying to find easy ways for you guys to make some money,

88
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,800
and I came across this website called opinionoutpost.com.

89
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,633
And it's like, it's super cool.

90
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,369
Like, literally all you have to do is you take opinion-based

91
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:01,809
surveys and they give you cash and gift cards.

92
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:02,698
Anyone can sign up.

93
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:03,531
So I'm gonna put the link down in the description,

94
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:06,495
so be sure and click that link right now.

95
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:07,846
Just a cool website for you guys to check out.

96
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:09,195
"What's 9 + 10?"

97
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:10,028
21. (small child's voice)

98
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:10,861
"What's 9 + 10?"

99
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:11,815
21. (small child's voice)

100
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:13,822
Wait, wait. Didn't someone just ask that question?

101
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:16,090
I can't use the same joke twice.

102
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,002
Next question.

103
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:18,095
"How old is Devan?"

104
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:19,506
Devin is 21. (small child's voice)

105
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:22,267
Okay, I'm really done with that joke. Let's move on.

106
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:24,631
I'm gonna be dropping my first rap album coming up here

107
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:27,539
very soon, but I want to make sure it's really good because

108
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:30,063
"You've only got one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow.

109
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:34,225
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo." (rap singing)

110
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:37,972
Oh. Hey guys. It's, uh still Joseph.

111
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:38,805
Swag.

112
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:40,147
"What is your favorite thing about your keypers?"

113
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:42,231
I love how you guys are always so supportive.

114
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:43,422
And not only supportive of me, but like

115
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:44,582
supportive of each other.

116
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:46,769
And you guys are always quick to bring in new keypers

117
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,481
and tell your friends about the family.

118
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:50,180
"What type of styles do you like on girls?"

119
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,013
I don't know.

120
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,264
I think it's something that's really up to you.

121
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:54,304
Whatever you feel confident and good in.

122
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:56,721
I think that's what you should wear because it comes across.

123
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:57,656
Oh, but there is one thing.

124
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,800
When girls, wear like those high socks. Haaah...

125
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,717
"You gotta bae or naw?"

126
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,234
One hundred percent single right now.

127
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:07,811
No bae for the holidays. Oh. Turn up.

128
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,544
"If you had to change your hair color what

129
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:10,392
would you change it to?"

130
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:11,593
When I was on tour with Demi,

131
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:12,783
like every day she would come to me and be like

132
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:14,855
"Hey Collins, you want to dye your hair today?"

133
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,559
And I was like "I don't know what to dye it to."

134
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,129
I'd probably go with, like, dark blue.

135
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,402
"Who is your favorite rapper?"

136
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:20,766
I mean, well you guys, you guys already know what

137
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:22,258
I'm gonna answer for this.

138
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:24,452
Chief Keef. Just kidding.

139
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:26,968
"It's Slim Shady y'all. What'd you even think.

140
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:29,068
Uh ha, uh ha." (hip hop music)

141
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,543
It's still Joseph. Still Joseph. Swag.

142
00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:32,545
"Can you make this your last question?"

143
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:33,614
Sorry, I can't.

144
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:36,098
And that is our last question for this video.

145
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:38,606
If you guys enjoyed it, be sure to give it huge thumbs up.

146
00:04:38,606 --> 00:04:40,793
And also, if you have anymore questions for me let me

148
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,462

I'll see you guys next week. Peace.

152
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:52,771
Whoa! (chuckles)

153
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:55,334
Hi guys. It's Joseph again. Just always...

154
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,167
Swag.
