1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,967
- Cop. - Cop.

2
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:02,518
- Hello, police. - Po-Po!

3
00:00:02,518 --> 00:00:03,351
- Nothing happening here.

4
00:00:03,351 --> 00:00:05,234
- It was a po.

5
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:06,450
Almost burped.

6
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,283
I have the hiccups.

7
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:08,166
(hiccups)

8
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,420
- You have the hiccups?

9
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,307
(hiccups)

10
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:11,140
- Oh, that's not good.

11
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,215
(breathes in)

12
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:15,533
- I don't think holding your breath is a good idea, dude.

13
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:16,366
(beeps)

14
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:17,759
What's up, guys, it's Collins Key.

15
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:19,655
Now I'm missing Devan right now, so I think he slept in.

16
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:20,600
So give me one second.

17
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,625
(snaps)

18
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,057
You good, bro?

19
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:23,890
Today's the day, dog.

20
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,960
- Oh, today's the day.

21
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,792
- He is getting his wisdom teeth removed.

22
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,686
So he is gonna go out and do it in just a second.

23
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:29,760
And then, as you guys know,

24
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,981
when he gets the wisdom teeth removed,

25
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:33,029
they give him some, something that makes him all loopy.

26
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:35,001
So we're gonna just film it, see what happens.

27
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,201
(dramatic music)

28
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:38,150
Ready, Devan?

29
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,983
- I'm kind of tired.

30
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:41,518
- I think they're ready for you, bro, you should go.

31
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:43,790
- [Narrator] One eternity later.

32
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,457
(clock ticking)

33
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,916
(impact sound)

34
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,158
- [Collins] So Devan, we're gonna do a little interview

35
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:54,908
right now, all right?

36
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:00,371
I need verbal confirmation, is that cool?

37
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:03,267
- What?

38
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:04,280
- What are you looking at, bro?

39
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,113
- Shh, try.

40
00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:06,091
- Okay, first question.

41
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:07,554
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck

42
00:01:07,554 --> 00:01:10,811
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

43
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:11,644
- Wood.

44
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:15,309
- That's the right answer, congratulations. Next question.

45
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,142
- Nailed it!

46
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,975
- Do you have a girlfriend, Devan?

47
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,614
- Nah.

48
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:24,024
- You sure?

49
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:24,857
- Nah.

50
00:01:24,857 --> 00:01:25,690
- All right, Devan, I want you to name

51
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,025
what's your favorite food right now?

52
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:30,775
- Favorite food, hands down, would have to be

53
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:32,961
ice cream.

54
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,825
- What's your least favorite food?

55
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:41,055
- Salt. I hate salt.

56
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:43,713
There's too much salt on everything!

57
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:46,656
- All right, Devan, next question, you ready?

58
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:49,115
What's the first thing you notice about a girl?

59
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:52,032
- First thing I notice about a girl

60
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:54,692
is the girl.

61
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:56,084
(air horns)

62
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:56,979
Hands down.

63
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,818
- What is your least favorite video we've ever filmed?

64
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:02,735
- Now this one's tough.

65
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:07,520
- [Narrator] Three hours later.

66
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:11,686
Bro.

67
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:14,224
There's like four trees right there.

68
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:16,815
- Yeah, that's correct.

69
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:18,137
- There's four trees.

70
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,702
Why are there four trees?

71
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:21,628
- Wanna go fight them?

72
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:23,461
- You know what? I do.

73
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:26,299
- Wait, yo yo yo yo yo yo, bro,

74
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:27,962
I don't think you can walk.

75
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:32,129
Dude, you like literally couldn't walk a second ago.

76
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:35,941
(car door closes)

77
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:37,117
- You're right, I'd probably lose anyway.

78
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:38,351
- Do you remember anything from like,

79
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:40,039
when you were going into the operation?

80
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,053
- Absolutely nothing.

81
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:44,080
The only thing I remember,

82
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,195
they asked a lot of questions.

83
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:47,161
- Like what kind of questions?

84
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,100
- Just random questions.

85
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,734
Just like how old are you?

86
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:53,377
What's your name?

87
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:57,544
I'm like why do you need to know this about me so personal?

88
00:02:58,643 --> 00:02:59,932
- What's your name?

89
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,930
- It's Mike. Duh.

90
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,466
Not a lot of people know it, and they were asking it.

91
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,575
And I'm like, guys!

92
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:07,439
- Just to clarify, right now,

93
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,820
you're saying that Mike is your real name

94
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,281
and Devan is like a stage name?

95
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:12,355
- Devan is a wack name,

96
00:03:12,355 --> 00:03:14,198
I don't know where you came up with that.

97
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:15,923
Mike is my name.

98
00:03:15,923 --> 00:03:17,322
- Mike.

99
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,589
- Mike, bro!

100
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,530
Like Mike and Ike.

101
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,578
It just rhymes with so much stuff like

102
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,490
Mike.

103
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,778
Ike.

104
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:26,445
Chilling on my bike.

105
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:30,128
Rolling up to the street.

106
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,206
You know, it just rhymes with so much stuff.

107
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:33,623
Out of all names,

108
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:36,469
Mike is my name.

109
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:37,521
- So from now on, you're sticking with it.

110
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:39,264
You are now to be known as Mike.

111
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:40,800
- Bro, I was always Mike.

112
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,552
- So 2017, you now Mike.

113
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:46,451
- My name is Mike. My brother's name is Ike.

114
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:48,172
- No, not true.

115
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:51,112
I am Collins, and you are supposed to be Devan

116
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:52,527
but I think the drugs took you away.

117
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,477
Question I have for you, Devan.

118
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:55,597
- No questions.

119
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:57,203
I don't take questions anymore.

120
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,696
- Are you okay that I'm filming you in your car?

121
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,703
- No!

122
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:00,808
Actually, it's okay.

123
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,358
Oh my gosh.

124
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:03,191
- What?

125
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,024
- Choked.

126
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:05,270
- So Devan, I've got some really deep,

127
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,274
complicated questions for you right now.

128
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:11,386
- Hit me up, dog, in the DMs get keep popping.

129
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:12,219
- Are you ready for this?

130
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,223
- So ready.

131
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:14,844
- Do you think 'sand' is called 'sand'

132
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:18,344
because it's between the sea and the land?

133
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:24,426
Next question.

134
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:25,845
If you drop soap on the floor,

135
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:28,413
is the floor clean or is the soap dirty?

136
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:30,154
- I've thought about that one.

137
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:33,904
Literally thought about that one right there.

138
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:36,672
I don't even know.

139
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:42,973
- Got a question for you, Devan.

140
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:47,128
How come our nose runs but our feet smell?

141
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:48,261
- Our noses run?

142
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:50,894
- Yeah, like a drippy nose or whatever, when you get sick.

143
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:52,457
- Oh, drippy nose.

144
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:54,129
Should've just said that, dude, jeez.

145
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,212
Bro, our feet can smell things?

146
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,045
- Oh my god.

147
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:58,793
- Nobody every told me this.

148
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:01,586
Do they have like, nostrils on my nose

149
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:03,586
that I never knew about?

150
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:07,359
Bro.

151
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,354
- Dude, what the, when did that get there?

152
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:10,187
- That's a little close to my face.

153
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:11,524
- Do my toes have noses?

154
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:13,348
- I don't know, but that's a little close to my face.

155
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:15,035
- Back off, hater.

156
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:15,868
Back off.

157
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:17,931
- Whoa, look at me for a second?

158
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:18,764
- Nailed it.

159
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:20,910
- You got blood all around your mouth.

160
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,077
- Do I really?

161
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:32,385
- And just on cue, it's your smoothie.

162
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:33,468
- Ah, woohoo!

163
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:38,419
I got the smoothie. I got the smoothie.

164
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,269
Which one is mine?

165
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:40,487
- [Mom] No, you can't drink it yet.

166
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:41,320
- What?

167
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,153
- [Mom] Not till we get home.

168
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:42,986
- I can't drink it yet?

169
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:43,819
- [Mom] Nope.

170
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,322
- What, trying to torture me?

171
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:47,489
(rewinds)

172
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,474
- There he is. Oh, hey!

173
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:54,108
- Hey guys.

174
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:55,002
- What's up?

175
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:56,515
- Hey, how are you?

176
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:57,391
- We're good.

177
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,224
- Yeah?

178
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:01,684
- [Collins] How are you man, how was the surgery?

179
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:02,852
- Lit fam!

180
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:04,617
- It was what?

181
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:06,670
- It was awesome.

182
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,587
- [Mom] It was awesome?

183
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:10,832
- Feels great.

184
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:11,833
- You feel good?

185
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,129
- I can't really see right now.

186
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:17,147
This is kinda weird.

187
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:17,980
- Everything's blurry?

188
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,804
- My eyes are like going from left to right.

189
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:23,338
It feels really weird.

190
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:26,578
Well guys, give this video a thumbs up

191
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:28,893
for me getting my wisdom teeth torn out

192
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:31,193
or turn up, I mean, taken out.

193
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:34,391
Comment, "Keyper Squad" and subscribe to this channel

194
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:38,308
and turn up push notifications in five seconds.

195
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,242
Five.

196
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,392
Four.

197
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:47,636
I can't feel my tongue.

198
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:49,577
Like I literally can't feel my tongue.

199
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:50,465
- [Mom] That's normal.

200
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:51,298
- It's normal?

201
00:06:51,298 --> 00:06:52,210
- It's normal.

202
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,305
- This is normal?

203
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:57,261
I'm like, there's like, two light switches over there.

204
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,136
Are there really two light switches?

205
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,748
Or is this my imagination?

206
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:01,967
- [Collins] I can confirm there are

207
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,176
actually three light switches, Devan.

208
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:04,532
- There's three light switches?

209
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:05,684
- No, there's only two. There's only two.

210
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:06,966
- No, there's four now!

211
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:08,117
- Like your little blanket, by the way.

212
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:08,950
You look really comfortable.

213
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,201
- Like, what is happening right now?

214
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:12,034
Whoa.

215
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,987
- What are you looking at?

216
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:16,987
- The thing.

217
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,166
- The ceiling?

218
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,042
- Yo, Bar!

219
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:20,875
- Yo.

220
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:21,955
- My man!

221
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:23,655
Thank you, bro.

222
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:24,908
Love you.

223
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:26,507
- Got a lot of chapstick on right now.

224
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:28,596
- I have chapstick on?

225
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:29,429
Do I look good?

226
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:30,262
- Ha.

227
00:07:33,502 --> 00:07:34,518
Ha.

228
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:35,538
- [Mom] Those are your teeth.

229
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,288
- These are my teeth?

230
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:40,956
Oh.

231
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,972
(laughs)

232
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:44,301
- [Collins] How many fingers am I holding up?

233
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,134
- Seven.

234
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:46,301
Ha, nailed it.

235
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:52,383
Yo but I'm back, guys, this is super cool.

236
00:07:52,383 --> 00:07:54,057
I like this.

237
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:54,890
Hey, mom.

238
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,723
- Hi.

239
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:59,041
- I can't focus on you, but I see you. Hey.

240
00:07:59,041 --> 00:07:59,874
- Hi.

241
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:00,707
- Hi.

242
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:03,438
There's two exit to the lobby signs.

243
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:04,873
- Devan, Devan you're pretty loud, bro.

244
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:06,203
- Devan, you're getting really loud.

245
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:07,533
- I'm getting really loud?

246
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:08,738
- You're like yelling, bro.

247
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,607
- I'm yelling?

248
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:11,567
- Bring it down just a little.

249
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,580
- Just a little bit.

250
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,751
Like this quiet.

251
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:18,073
Wait, there's only two light switches?

252
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:19,116
- [Collins] Yep, there's only two.

253
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:20,717
- I thought there's four light switches.

254
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,242
- Devan, Devan, you're yelling again. You're yelling again.

255
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:24,812
- And now there's, the sign levitated again.

256
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:26,286
- Shh.

257
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:27,119
Are you Snapchatting?

258
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:27,952
- No.

259
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:29,389
- [Mom] You know you Snapchatted when you first came out?

260
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:31,171
- I Snapchatted when I first came out?

261
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,004
For reals?

262
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:32,837
- We don't know where it went.

263
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:34,496
It might've gone out, it might not have gone out.

264
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:37,323
- Well I can check right now.

265
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:38,156
Yo!

266
00:08:38,156 --> 00:08:40,966
- [Collins] You Snapchatted a lot, bro. Dude!

267
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:41,945
- Oh my god!

268
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:43,543
- We're gonna stand straight up.

269
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:45,126
- Okay, cool. Whoa.

270
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:48,894
Can't really stand.

271
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:51,409
Whoa, hey, ho. Oh, whoa.

272
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,118
She told me not to talk.

273
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:53,972
- [Mom] Yeah, no.

274
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:55,175
- But I'm gonna talk.

275
00:08:55,175 --> 00:08:56,008
- Shh. No.

276
00:08:57,018 --> 00:08:58,120
- Breaking the rules.

277
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,591
- Take this in this hand,

278
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:04,591
and now I want you to put this against that cheek.

279
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:05,424
- Okay.

280
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:07,870
(burps)

281
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,961
I burp.

282
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:10,597
Is this a ride in a wheelchair?

283
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:14,009
- [Collins] Shh, Devan, remember, inside voice.

284
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:16,154
- We do it awesome.

285
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:17,210
Whoo!

286
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,428
I'm like the light of speed, man.

287
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:20,976
There's, speed of light?

288
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:21,835
Light speed?

289
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:22,668
I don't know.

290
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:24,119
Whoo!

291
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:24,962
- Okay, here comes a bump

292
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:26,020
(yells)

293
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,000
- Yo!

294
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,547
I have never traveled this fast in my life.

295
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:31,380
Oh!

296
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
It's a ramp!

297
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:34,234
Whoo!

298
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,577
Okay, this is tough.

299
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,410
- I know.

300
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,599
- All right. All right, all right, all right.

301
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,534
I'm gonna lock my knees,

302
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:43,095
and I'm gonna like put some muscle into this.

303
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:45,318
(yells)

304
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,151
Yeah!

305
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,006
Whoo!

306
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,673
(fast forwards)

307
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,478
Oh, thanks. Oh, thanks.

308
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:55,418
Oh, thank you.

309
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:58,604
- Come on, Devan, do a little more strength, okay?

310
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:00,109
(fast forwards)

311
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:01,379
- Whoa.

312
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:02,456
- Okay, no, no.

313
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:05,304
One, two, three, come up.

314
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,588
- [Collins] All right, Devan, so give me the update.

315
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:07,696
We are now in the car.

316
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:09,658
What's going on in the world of Devan?

317
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:12,055
- Oh my god, that's what I look like?

318
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:13,239
Oh my god.

319
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,637
I look beautiful. I look beautiful.

320
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:18,058
(laughs)

321
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:19,558
- Okay, so, Devan.

322
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:22,142
Devan?

323
00:10:22,142 --> 00:10:22,975
- Huh?

324
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:26,021
- We can go home, and you can have the food at home,

325
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:28,347
or I can stop by and get you a smoothie somewhere.

326
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:30,413
- Y'all, let's get a smoothie.

327
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:31,383
Is that a turtle?

328
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:32,454
I see a turtle.

329
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:34,537
Bro, the turtle's flying.

330
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:37,859
Yo, it's a fast car.

331
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,350
- I think they were trying to race us.

332
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,670
- [Collins] Oop, we lost him.

333
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,996
- Ha ha, I'm back.

334
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:45,371
I feel like curling up in this position.

335
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:48,184
This feels most natural to me.

336
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:50,195
- That's the most natural position you can think of?

337
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:52,738
- Bro, you're just a hater.

338
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:53,571
Okay?

339
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,404
- Ooh.

340
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,237
- Back off.

341
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,070
- [Mom] All right, sit up.

342
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,131
Use your arm to lift yourself up.

343
00:10:58,131 --> 00:11:00,131
(yells)

344
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,872
- Got it.

345
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:02,789
Yo, yo, yo.

346
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,779
I'm bleeding.

347
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,622
- [Collins] Tell me, Devan, would you be down

348
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:09,586
to do a carpool karaoke?

349
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,800
- Carpool karaoke

350
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,200
(vocalizes)

351
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,322
Yes, I hit all the notes.

352
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:17,668
- What song would you wanna sing?

353
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:20,926
- I would wanna sing some yodeling song.

354
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:23,673
Doesn't even have to be a specific song, just

355
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:25,119
(yodels)

356
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,819
- All right, well, let's do it.

357
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,389
- Let's do it!

358
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,314
- Jeez.

359
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,255
All right, Devan, so right now,

360
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:32,171
we are about to do the carpool karaoke.

361
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:33,225
Mom's about to hit a car.

362
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,423
All right, so right now, Devan,

363
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:36,527
you ready to do some carpool karaoke?

364
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:38,389
- Am I about to be James Corden?

365
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,169
- So you said you wanted to do some yodeling, right?

366
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,981
(yodels)

367
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:43,328
So I'll let you kick it off, go for it.

368
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,411
(yodels)

369
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:56,198
- Did I kill it?

370
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:57,381
- That was kill it. You killed it.

371
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:59,464
(yodels)

372
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,913
(beat boxes)

373
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,633
(yodels)

374
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:20,989
- I just, I just nailed it.

375
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:22,578
- Wow. That was pretty impressive, not gonna lie.

376
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:24,911
(vocalizes)

377
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:29,637
- I got blood!

378
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:31,147
I blood my lip.

379
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:32,018
- [Collins] Did you get it?

380
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,264
- Nope. But listen.

381
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:34,342
- Yes?

382
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:36,980
- That car look funky.

383
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,023
- Prius?

384
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,106
- Perhaps so.

385
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:41,806
- What?

386
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:44,889
- Oh, good.

387
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,993
- Yo, I have an idea.

388
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:47,977
Right now, you wanna do a little yeeting contest?

389
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:48,810
- Yeet!

390
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,505
- We'll start off quiet. Yeet.

391
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:52,481

395
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:56,895
- Yeet.

396
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:59,238
- Yeet.

397
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,464
- Yeet.

398
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:01,355

399
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:02,188
- Yeet!

400
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:08,392
- Yeah I can't top that,

401
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:10,212
that's the ultimate yeet for the day.

402
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:11,305
- Yeet!

403
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:12,822
Well today's a good day.

404
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:13,782
- Why?

405
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:15,347
- Because I'm rolling with my friends.

406
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:17,003
- Am I your friend?

407
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:18,753
- Nah, except my mom.

408
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:22,649
- Roasted!

409
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:24,121
- Dude, your breath is rancid, bro.

410
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:24,954
- Bro.

411
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:25,787
- No!

412
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:26,919
Oh, dude, that's horrible.

413
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,130
- Okay, I'll stop, I'll stop.

414
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,963
- Okay, thank you.

415
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:29,796
(breaths)

416
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:30,629
Dude, dude, it's so bad!

417
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:31,897
Where like you smell something terrible,

418
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:33,058
you can like, taste it?

419
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:34,190
That's what's happening right now.

420
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,204
Thank you for turning the air on, Mom.

421
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:36,222
I appreciate that.

422
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,977
- Whoa, that's a lot of air!

423
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:38,810
Whoo!

424
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,643
- Cop. - Cop.

425
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:41,093
- Hello, police. - Po-Po!

426
00:13:41,093 --> 00:13:42,125
- Nothing happening here.

427
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,894
- It was a Po.

428
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:44,994
Almost burped.

429
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:45,827
I have the hiccups.

430
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:46,766
(hiccups)

431
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:47,892
- You have the hiccups?

432
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:48,725
(hiccups)

433
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:49,558
- That's not good.

434
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:51,811
(breathes in)

435
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:55,978
- I don't think holding your breath is a good idea, dude.

436
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:00,834
(exhales)

437
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:01,667
Okay, all better.

438
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:02,500
Give me a hug, man.

439
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,882
- Okay. Don't breathe on me, bro.

440
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:07,072
I appreciate the love, Devan.

441
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,929
Nope, that's great, okay, yep, no, okay.

442
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:09,809
- You got a soft hair.

443
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:10,642
- Thanks.

444
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,642
- Whoa, hey, bunny ears.

445
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,102
(vocalizes)

446
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,409
- Oh, do a suh dude.

447
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:22,326
- Suh dude.

448
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:26,844
- Yeah, that'll work. That'll work.

449
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:30,594
Give us like a, just a normal Devan suh dude.

450
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:32,873
- Suh dude!

451
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,821
- This stuff makes him like absolutely wild.

452
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:35,654
That is for sure.

453
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:37,418
- This is normal Devan.

454
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,285
- This is normal Devan?

455
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:40,046
- This is normal Devan.

456
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:40,938
- This is the new normal?

457
00:14:40,938 --> 00:14:42,222
- This is the, nope.

458
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:43,722
Just normal Devan.

459
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:48,361
Yes.

460
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,688
Closer, closer, closer.

461
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,752
- So we're gonna put him in this chair.

462
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:53,585
- That chair?

463
00:14:53,585 --> 00:14:55,020
I hate that chair.

464
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,996
- Oh my gosh.

465
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,296
- That chair's terrible!

466
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,661
I won't touch my butt to it.

467
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:00,266
- Dude, you must touch your butt to it.

468
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,118
- My butt will evade it.

469
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,116
- I'm actually dying here, fam!

470
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:04,399
- I'm just trying to feel love.

471
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,232
Thank you guys.

472
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:06,504
- Get some attention, was that what it was?

473
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:07,337
- I feel loved.

474
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:08,170
- Bro, you good, fam?

475
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,003
- Get him in the chair.

476
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:09,836
- Okay.

477
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:10,669
What are you doing, dude?

478
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:11,502
Okay, Devan.

479
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:12,335
Dude, pick his butt up.

480
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:13,271
Get his butt off the chair.

481
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:14,104
Okay, there you go.

482
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:16,888
I need like a giant like, rubber band

483
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:18,023
to just wrap around him right now.

484
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:19,910
- Y'all are cool. Y'all are cool.

485
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,970
Are you having fun with this, Mom?

486
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,803
- Yes, I am.

487
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:22,636
- Having a good time?

488
00:15:22,636 --> 00:15:24,122
That's too big a spoon.

489
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:24,955
- Too big a spoon?

490
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:26,647
- You need a smaller spoon.

491
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:28,379
- I don't know if I have a smaller spoon.

492
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:29,574
- You better get one.

493
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:31,628
She's getting me a spoon.

494
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:32,461
Is it gonna hurt?

495
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:33,294
- No.

496
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:34,127
- All right.

497
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:34,960
- Okay.

498
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:37,915
Drink it down.

499
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:39,556
(impact sound)

500
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,270
- Okay, you get to hold on to this.

501
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,437
And here, you just get to touch any card you want, okay?

502
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:49,019
Whoa.

503
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:49,852
- That one.

504
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:50,685
- The four or the 10? The four?

505
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:51,518
Okay, take it out.

506
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:52,351
- Okay.

507
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:54,561
- Okay, I'll take it out for you.

508
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:56,223
And just if you can uncap the sharpie,

509
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:59,009
'cause I'm gonna have you sign the card, okay?

510
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:00,139
No no no no no no no!

511
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:01,110
Dude, don't use your mouth!

512
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,943
What are you doing?

513
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:03,520
Okay, just touch it with your mouth.

514
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,586
Okay, here.

515
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:06,214
So I want you to just take the sharpie,

516
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:09,370
and just sign your card, your four.

517
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,787
Oh my gosh, dude.

518
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:12,718
Dude, really?

519
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:16,102
No, now you got my finger, bro!

520
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:19,133
Okay, so we'll recap the sharpie.

521
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,031
- Is it me, or did I nail that signature?

522
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:25,625
- Yeah, that was the Devan original signature right there.

523
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,300
- Nailed it!

524
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,328
- It's getting a little bit violent at the moment.

525
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:29,161
- Woohoo!

526
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:30,258
- Here, watch, we'll try this.

527
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:31,091
- Yeah?

528
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:31,924
- Check this out, you ready?

529
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,016
- Oh my, you got sharpie on me, bro!

530
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:34,849
How did you do that?

531
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:35,682
- You ready?

532
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:36,755
Watch right here, watch.

533
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:40,172
We're gonna go one, two, three like this.

534
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:44,644
(laughs)

535
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:46,450
And then here, hold onto the marker for me.

536
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,391
Pinch on the marker now, pinch on the marker.

537
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:49,224
- But how?

538
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:50,635
- Pinch on the marker, pinch on the marker.

539
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,112
Dude, just pinch the marker.

540
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,265
Here we go, watch, we go one, two, three like that.

541
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:57,645
And then we can take it right off, right?

542
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:58,478
- What?

543
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,508
No, get that away.

544
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:06,905
(tapping)

545
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:08,430
I don't know how you do it, bro.

546
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,531
I really don't know how you do it.

547
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:10,364
- All right, well guys,

548
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,632
I think that's about it for this video.

549
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,162
So Devan, I think you get the honors

550
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,795
of doing the outro right now, so.

551
00:17:14,795 --> 00:17:16,538
- We're giving away this card.

552
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,762
- Yeah, we are giving away this card on our Instagram.

553
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:20,453
So if you wanna win it, all you have to do,
