00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,316
- [Collins Key] What's up guys? It is Collins Key.

2
00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:04,106
Now I am here in Dallas, Texas for the

3
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:07,078
Pop Tarts Crazy Good Summer concert tour with Demi Lovato.

4
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:09,361
Now, it's Pop Tarts' 50th birthday, so to celebrate,

5
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,792
they are throwing all their Crazy Good concerts for free.

6
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:12,625
Now, as you guys know,

7
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,809
my favorite flavor of Pop-Tarts is cookies & creme.

8
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:16,438
But today, we're gonna be finding out what Demi's is,

9
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:18,052
and I want you guys to comment down below right now

10
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:22,654
and see if you can guess what her favorite flavor is.

11
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:24,564
Now as you guys know, I went on tour with Demi

12
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:27,482
on the Neon Lights Tour and I haven't seen Demi in a while.

13
00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:29,096
So I'm really excited to be able to catch up with her,

14
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,435
hang out, and talk about some cool things.

15
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:32,886
Now right now, I want you guys to go to

16
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:35,097
poptartscrazygood.com to find out all the details

17
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:37,332
about this tour and also to find out how you guys

18
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:38,665
can see EMBLEM3.

19
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:41,991
I'm really excited to be here with you because

20
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,756
this is Pop-Tarts' 50th anniversary.

21
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:44,589
- [Demi] Mm hm.

22
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:46,906
- And this is like a crazy party for them.

23
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:49,284
And so I wanted to ask you, when you turn 50,

24
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:52,347
what do you want to be your crazy, like, blow-out birthday?

25
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:55,587
- Yeah, something that's totally stereotypical.

26
00:00:55,587 --> 00:00:57,703
No, I don't know what I'd do for my 50th birthday.

27
00:00:57,703 --> 00:01:00,448
I think I would skydive or something like that.

28
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:01,288
That'd be cool.

29
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:03,064
- Alright, so I know you've been traveling a ton

30
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,513
and I always see your Instagram posts, you're everywhere.

31
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:06,993
So what has been the highlight of your

32
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:08,312
crazy good summer so far?

33
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:12,841
- The highlight of my crazy good summer so far:

34
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:17,136
I got to go home for a couple of days, almost a week,

35
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:21,177
and spent my Fourth of July here in Texas.

36
00:01:21,177 --> 00:01:22,444
- Oh, that's awesome.

37
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:24,486
Okay, so of course, what's your favorite Pop-Tart flavor?

38
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:26,235
- S'mores, which is right behind you.

39
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:27,295
- S'mores? Right behind me.

40
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,188
I brought along your favorite flavor.

41
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:30,021
- Ahhh.

42
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,174
- Hey, actually, hold on.

43
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,629
I want to show you a magic trick with them really quick.

44
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:34,879
Check this out.

45
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:39,763
- Can you crack it open and make a $100 bill come out?

46
00:01:39,763 --> 00:01:41,245
- Watch. You want a $100 bill?

47
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:42,078
- Yeah.

48
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:43,609
- Which? Like, do you want the

49
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:45,197
new hundreds or the old hundreds?

50
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:46,786
Oh, shoot. Which one?

51
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:47,619
- Uh, new!

52
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:48,613
- New hundreds?

53
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:49,911
Check this out. I want you guys to see this.

54
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:51,193
Look at this.

55
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:52,026
- If you do this...

56
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:52,859
- Look at this.

57
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,189
- I'm gonna freak out.

58
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,022
- That would have been awesome.

59
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:56,384
- That would have been really cool!

60
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,584
(laughter)

61
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,128
- What's like your favorite song to perform?

62
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:02,624
- You know, it's whatever the crowd is most into.

63
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,548
So I think right now, it's "Really Don't Care."

64
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:07,237
- I want to give a huge thank you to Pop-Tarts

65
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,053
and Demi for the amazing show tonight.

66
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:10,951
And also, I had so much fun talking with Demi

67
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:12,448
and re-living what it was like to be on the

68
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:13,568
Neon Lights Tour.

69
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:14,892
And if you guys have any questions that you

70
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:16,626
would love to ask Demi, let me know what they are

71
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,796
in the comments down below because next time I see her,

72
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:20,485
I might ask your question.

73
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:22,255
Now, this has definitely been the highlight of my

74
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,096
crazy good summer.

75
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:24,384

You signed the Joker that you put in your mouth.

82
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:39,661
- Oh my God!

83
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:43,558

84
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,343
