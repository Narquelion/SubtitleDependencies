1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:03,721
- I like whipped cream on my waffles.

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,128
(laughing)

3
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:07,242
What's up, it's Collins Key and for today's video,

4
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:08,972
I am doing something very special.

5
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:10,771
To start this, I need someone to help me out

6
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,822
so are you ready for this?

7
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:14,302
- [Mikey Bolts] No, I'm not gonna do it!

8
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:15,199
- You said you would do this.

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,032
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:17,682
- [Mikey Bolts] No, no, no, I'm over this, no.

11
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:18,931
- You are teleporting here right now.

12
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:19,764
(snaps fingers)

13
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:22,765
- (sighs) All right.

14
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:23,712
(Collins laughs)

15
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:25,087
- So guys, today I am joined

16
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:28,402
by the master voice impressionist himself, Mikey Bolts,

17
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,632
and today we're going to be prank calling

18
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:31,751
a whole bunch of super-famous YouTubers

19
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:33,829
with voice impressions and we're gonna to be telling them

20
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:35,498
that we just found this brand new feature

21
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:38,105
on the iPhone 7 that will actually change your voice

22
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,765
into a cartoon character's voice.

23
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:41,010
And hopefully, they believe it.

24
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,748
I mean I can get creative because I've done a lot

25
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:44,396
of pranks on these different YouTubers

26
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:45,767
and so they might be catching on by now.

27
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,576
So today is going to be a challenge to see

28
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:49,692
if we can pull one more prank on them.

29
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,345
And you have to do a thumbs up if you guys want a part two

30
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:53,925
with even more of voice impressions and comment down below

31
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:55,753
who are your favorite cartoon character you would love

32
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:57,628
to see us do a voice impression of.

33
00:00:57,628 --> 00:00:59,323
Now make sure you guys go check out a video we did

34
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:00,316
on Mikey's channel.

35
00:01:00,316 --> 00:01:03,845
We called Apple employees and let them know the iPhone 7

36
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:05,761
was having some major bugs via cartoon voices

37
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:06,844
and a whole bunch

38
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:07,960
of different voice impressions on that one.

39
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,511
Link is right over there and if you guys are one

40
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:13,227
of my people, very important, go subscribe to Mikey.

41
00:01:13,227 --> 00:01:14,429
This guy is the man.

42
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:15,842
So, so talented.

43
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,520
I've been a fan of his for three years now.

44
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,109
So make sure you guys go show his channel

45
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,942
some serious love.

46
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:20,874
Give us a video thumbs up

47
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,082
and just like comment and be like,

48
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,248
"Yo, Collin's channel sent me."

49
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:25,070
Without any further ado, right now let's jump in

50
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,229
and just get to the prank calling.

51
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:28,062
- Let's do it.

52
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:28,895
(laughs)

53
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,684
(phone ringing)

54
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:33,363
- You what, how quick was that?

55
00:01:33,363 --> 00:01:35,613
(giggling)

56
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:39,572
- Sure!

57
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:42,739
You guys are like very giggly tonight.

58
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:44,852
- OK, I just got the iPhone 7

59
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:46,351
and there's this new feature on it

60
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:47,569
and it's kind of like a hidden feature.

61
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:48,950
You can basically manipulate your voice

62
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,624
into any cartoon character's voice.

63
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:52,957
So just give me a sentence.

64
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,878
- Boopadegumbo?

65
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:02,641
- OK, I'll try boopadegumbo.

66
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:05,684
And, I'll try like do you guys know Family Guy at all?

67
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:07,394
OK, well they have a Stewie voice.

68
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,590
Let me try it.

69
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,333
- Boopadegumbo

70
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,166
- Right?

71
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,647
- Yeah! It's freaky!

72
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:18,300
No, no give me another sentence.

73
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:23,162
- Lactise em what?

74
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:23,995
I'll just give it a shot.

75
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:24,999
I'll try like in Peter voice.

76
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:26,416
- Lactase enzymes

77
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:28,434
are good.

78
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:31,862
Yeah!

79
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:34,846
(girls giggling)

80
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,487
- Right?

81
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:39,301
(girls giggling)

82
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,247
- Hello, ladies.

83
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:41,495
Kermit the frog here.

84
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,492
I want you to submit whatever you have promptly

85
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:46,612
and I will say it.

86
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:47,445
Thank you.

87
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:50,195
(girls giggling)

88
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,079
- You guys know I have zero voice impression skills

89
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,579
Hello, I'm Stewie.

90
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,125
That's kind of savage, but yeah.

91
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:07,010
- The rain in space stays mainly in the place.

92
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:09,509
- No, I'm just messing with you guys.

93
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,149
I am actually collabing with the creator of Family Guy

94
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,730
right now, Seth McFarlane.

95
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,994
(gasps)

96
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,215
- Hi!

97
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:17,215
Yeah, so say hi to Seth.

98
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,625
- Hey, how's it going?

99
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,625
How are you?

100
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,118
- Thank you.

101
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,277
- Are there any other questions that you guys have for him

102
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:30,610
or anything you guys want to say to him?

103
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,106
- Oh, thank you so much, ladies.

104
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:36,105
That means a lot.

105
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,855
Thank you, seriously.

106
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,907
Oh, okay.

107
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:42,574
I'll follow you both on Twitter.

108
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:47,467
All right, you guys are fun.

109
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:51,123
- (laughing) So guys, I'm sorry.

110
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:52,873
This is a prank call.

111
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:57,169
This heartbreak has been Mikey Bolts

112
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,894
It's totally here, I'm sorry.

113
00:03:58,894 --> 00:04:00,977
(laughs)

114
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:06,233
- Now we can (mumbles), you ruined it.

115
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,650
- I'm real sorry!

116
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:16,965
- He's so much lamer.

117
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:19,230
- I'm sorry guys.

118
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,232
Yeah, I know!

119
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,310
You guys better get me back,

120
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,143
that's all I'm saying!

121
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,791
So sorry, guys!

122
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:39,465
All right, guys, I love you.

123
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:41,540
I'll talk to you guys later.

124
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,979
All right, cool, bye!

125
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:44,881
(laughing)

126
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:45,889
- Oh my!

127
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:46,887
- Yo, I'm sorry Veronica and Vanessa.

128
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,178
You guys, I love you guys so much.

129
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:49,180
You guys are the homies.

130
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,656
So, I'm waiting for you guys to get my back.

131
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:52,944
This is literally my fourth time of hard core pranking them.

132
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:54,528
All right guys, I'm calling the...

133
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,361
Hello?

134
00:04:57,595 --> 00:04:58,428
Dang it!

135
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,085
It literally came in on the worst freaking sentence.

136
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:01,082
Oh my God!

137
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:02,282
The guys are pranking, oh my God, and you answered.

138
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,852
Well, that was great!

139
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:09,668
Uh hey, so you heard about this new iPhone 7, right?

140
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:10,881
Well, did you hear

141
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:13,964
that you can make new voices with it?

142
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:16,912
- Hello Gabby!

143
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,783
(laughs)

144
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:20,616
- Yeah!

145
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:23,866
All right, well, that was worth a shot.

146
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:26,046
All right.

147
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:26,879
Thank you.

148
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:30,303
Have a good night.

149
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:31,851
Bye!

150
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:32,850
- That was great!

151
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,763
- That could not have gone better, in my opinion.

152
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:35,764
- Perfect!

153
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:36,763
- Nailed that, from top to bottom.

154
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:39,193
I'm calling BruhItsZach or Zach Clayton.

155
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,693
So I hope that this goes well.

156
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:43,901
Yo, what's up bruh?

157
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:45,070
I just got the new iPhone 7, dude.

158
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,653
There's this new setting in it where I can like

159
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:48,235
make my voice in like Family Guy.

160
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:50,652
Right, give me a line to say.

161
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:54,418
- You look like a monkey!

162
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:55,251
- You

163
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:57,473
look like

164
00:05:57,473 --> 00:05:58,769
a monkey.

165
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:00,852
- Right, bro, it's crazy!

166
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:02,828
Dude, it's nuts!

167
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:04,042
Even like Peter.

168
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:06,864
Give me another line to say.

169
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:07,697
You smell, okay.

170
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:09,780
- You smell like cheetos.

171
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:13,170
- What's like a popular song right now?

172
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,461
What's the Justin Bieber one?

173
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:15,775
How does that one go?

174
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,772
If you feel yourself sinking in the cold, cold water.

175
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:20,093
Right, but check this out.

176
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:24,260
- If you feel yourself sinking in the cold, cold water.

177
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,065
(laughs)

178
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:28,750
- No, bro, I'm doing a prank call.

179
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,296
(laughs)

180
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:32,740
Yeah, that everyone.

181
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,323
Have a great night!

182
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:37,385
(laughs)

183
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:40,025
All right, cool, talk to you later, bro.

184
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:40,983
- Bye, Zach.

185
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,826
- All right guys.

186
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:44,301
The next person I'm calling is Chloe Couture.

187
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:48,508
- [Voicemail] You have reached the voice mailbox of

188
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,341
- This is Chloe.

189
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,174
She called me back.

190
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:51,007
Hey!

191
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:52,478
So with the new iPhone 7, like I just got one.

192
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,152
You can manipulate your own voice in a cartoon voice.

193
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:59,149
So just give me a sentence to say like I'll show you.

194
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:03,000
- Chloe is the best YouTuber of all time

195
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,583
and she is awesome.

196
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:07,685
- Yeah.

197
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,285
It just manipulates my voice into that.

198
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:10,723
Let me just try something, hold on.

199
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:11,785
- I think you're great.

200
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:13,048
You're so pretty.

201
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:14,798
You're always pretty.

202
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:18,849
(laughs)

203
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:20,349
- Right? It's so..

204
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:25,581
Yeah or even if it's just on a call like this.

205
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:26,580
Here's another one too.

206
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,747
- If you sneeze, make sure you use a tissue paper.

207
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:35,780
- Yeah, I know.

208
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,466
It's really, really, really cool!

209
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:40,163
And there's even Patrick from Spongebob and stuff.

210
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:42,746
- I have to go to the bathroom.

211
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:45,888
- Like I don't have to go to the bathroom.

212
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:48,638
I was just saying that and stuff.

213
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,543
So my idea is like if we prank call YouTubers,

214
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,710
and use the voice on them.

215
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:59,142
Cause what would happen would be like we would call

216
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:01,067
the YouTubers and prank them and they would think

217
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,840
that I am actually calling them to set up a collab.

218
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,744
But in fact, I'm actually calling them

219
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:09,582
to prank call them with these voices.

220
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:10,580
Kinda like right now.

221
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,663
(laughs)

222
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,829
No, this is a prank call.

223
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,503
Yeah!

224
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:29,624
Yeah I'm here with my friend, Mikey,

225
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:30,707
who does voice impressions.

226
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:32,790
- Sorry for pranking you.

227
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,042
- No, it's Mikey.

228
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:37,296
- Nope, all me.

229
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:38,129
My bad!

230
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:40,094
- Yeah, no, I'm so sorry!

231
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:41,525
Have a great night!

232
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:42,358
All right.

233
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:43,566
We're going to give Rachel a Facetime.

234
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,808
Is that a thing when you give someone a Facetime?

235
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:45,801
- I'm gonna give her a Facetime.

236
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,862
- One Facetime for you.

237
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,062
Do you know Family Guy at all?

238
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,810
Okay, well you can do a Family Guy voice.

239
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,643
I'm gonna try this one.

240
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,310
I like cheese a lot.

241
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:56,260
Right?

242
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,718
And I can try a Peter voice too

243
00:08:57,718 --> 00:08:58,727
and it's like

244
00:08:58,727 --> 00:08:59,728
I like

245
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:00,729
whipped cream

246
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:01,896
on my waffles.

247
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:06,642
Tell me like something to say.

248
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:09,559
What's the deal with airplane food?

249
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:12,477
Cool!

250
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,499
Well, yeah, this is actually a prank call.

251
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:15,502
I don't know how else to say it.

252
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:16,505
That's just yeah.

253
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:17,611
Yeah I'm here with my friend, Mikey,

254
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:18,613
that does voice impressions and stuff.

255
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:21,030
- Hi, sorry for pranking you!

256
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:24,417
- Yay!

257
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:26,673
All right, so we're calling Jake Foushee right now,

258
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:28,959
and he has a new number so I don't have his new number.

259
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,956
Mikey does.

260
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:34,060
- There'll be a couple of hooligans doing voice prank calls.

261
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,245
- Yo, brother.

262
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:37,846
This is (mumbles) Collins.

263
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:39,511
Why?

264
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,657
I appreciate it!

265
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:43,022
You're the man, bro!

266
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:45,105
Do you have the iPhone 7?

267
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:48,616
Okay dude, I just got one.

268
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:50,356
There is an e-straight feature on the iPhone 7

269
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,033
that will manipulate your voice

270
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:54,550
into any cartoon voice or something.

271
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,717
Give me a sentence to say.

272
00:09:57,906 --> 00:09:59,330
All right, I'll try it like Peter.

273
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,969
Let me see if the Peter one works.

274
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:01,968
- Ah,

275
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,176
I just started a fire.

276
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:05,009
- Right?

277
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,679
Even if it's like making noise, you can turn it

278
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,902
to Kermit the Frog and make weird sounds

279
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,792
- Hip hop hebop sneerop.

280
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,524
Kermit the Frog here.

281
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:13,024
Hap ho up keep up.

282
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:16,554
- I know, man!

283
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:18,244
Apple took away the headphone jack

284
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:20,241
but they gave us the voices, man!

285
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:21,574
It's like crazy!

286
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,066
Yeah and it even works with song lyrics and stuff

287
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:29,233
and it will sing popular songs like...

288
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:38,749
Yeah that's so awesome!

289
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,045
Wrong, this is just a prank call.

290
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:41,228
Do you know Mikey Bolts?

291
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:43,423
Yeah, well he's right here with me right now.

292
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:44,739
He's the one doing the voices.

293
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:46,072
- What up, Jake?

294
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:48,871
My bad!

295
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,422
We didn't mean to joke on you.

296
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:51,808
You're a good guy!

297
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:53,225
- I'm sorry, bro!

298
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:57,327
(laughs)

299
00:10:57,327 --> 00:10:59,077
No, bro, you're good.

300
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,517
(laughs)

301
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:04,518
Too funny, bro!

302
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:06,435
- You're the man, Jake!

303
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:17,226
- Let's hear it! - Which one?

304
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:21,312
- Yeah, I gotta give that one a shot.

305
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,935
I can't do it.

306
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:24,217
I'll be like Autobots, transform and roll out.

307
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,509
That's legit, bro.

308
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,759
Go check out the video we did on Mikey's channel

309
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,555
where we prank called all the Apple store employees.

310
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,065
The link is right over there.

311
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,396
Give it a thumbs up.

312
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:33,401
Comment that this video sent you

313
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,950
and subscribe to Mikey.

314
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,047
This guy is amazing!

315
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:37,332
And like I said, thumbs up for a part two

316
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:38,820
with even more cartoon voices.

317
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,990
I love you guys so much!

318
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,745
New videos coming out two, even three times a week,

319
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:43,972
so that means you've got to subscribe.

320
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,179
Without any further ado,

321
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,081
would you like to make me disappear right now?

322
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:46,914
You get the honors.

323
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,339
- I would love to, Collins!

324
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,250
- Psych! Too late!

325
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,943
- That didn't go as planned.
