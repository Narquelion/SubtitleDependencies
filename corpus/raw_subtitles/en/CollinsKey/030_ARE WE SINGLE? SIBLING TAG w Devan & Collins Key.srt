00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:54,045
Okay Devin is the only person in the entire world

Oh gosh, briefs - Briefs definitely

00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:09,768
I don't like boxers.

They're like another pair of shorts under your,

well I don't wear shorts, but under your pants.

72
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:15,787
- Well I like pull up my pants and when that happens

73
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:17,654
the boxers just go with it, so

74
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:19,095
- It's like you have a giant cloud sitting

75
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:20,053
around your waist region.

76
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,429

- We're about to do it right now so let's find out.

99
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,975
Let the banana games begin!

101
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,998
(yelping)

102
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:22,842

103
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:25,092

00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,297

(laughing)

109
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,328
(spitting)

110
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:44,644
- What's your favorite dinosaur?

00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,349
Have you ever liked the same girl?

116
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:58,230
- The answer to that is a big whopping yes, many times

117
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,574
- Many times

118
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,339
Do you annoy each other? - Ohh dude chill!

119
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:04,791
Okay the answer to this one is yes

120
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,703
and I know just how to push Devin's buttons.

121
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:10,050
Like for instance, if I were to say like if we're in an

122
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,499
argument or something and if I'm like,

123
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,585
"Devin, are you getting mad right now? Devin are you angry?

124
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:14,985
"Are you feeling upset right now?"

125
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:16,203
- When I'm obviously not angry

126
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:17,667
- And it just like makes him angry

127
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,573
- What is the best impression of each other?

128
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:21,524
- I'll let you go first, ladies first.

129
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:23,381
- Oh gosh... - Impersonate me, bro

130
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,657
- Impersonate me, bro.

131
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:25,980
Should I laugh like you?

132
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,460
- Haha! Ah hahaha!

133
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,002
(high pitched laughing)

134
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,744
- That is not at all how I laugh, Devin.

135
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:32,443
- What's up guys, it is Collins Key and

136
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:34,199

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,190
- Alright, I have to say that's kinda spot on

138
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,318
- I don't, I mean I don't, shoot it off?!

139
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:42,564
When have I ever said it, "Let's shoot it off?"

140
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:46,423
I have never used that in any of my videos!

141
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:50,213
(laughing) Who said "Let's shoot it off?"

142
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,556
Whaaaat, seriously?

143
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:53,563
- A supreme marksman would say that.

144
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:56,016
(laughing)

145
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:56,933
- Whaaat??

146
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,332

- See you do kinda laugh like that!

150
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:10,353
- I don't-- - Hahahaha (impersonating)

151
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,368
- On the real.

152
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:14,112
- On the real, dude?? (laughing)

153
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:17,512
You never say any of these things in real life ever.

154
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:19,907
I have never heard you say "On the real",

155
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:23,157
"let's shoot it off", who are you dude?

156
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:28,393
You've changed! (laughing)

157
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:29,427
I literally, I'm crying right now.

158
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:30,594
- Ready for this one?

159
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:32,263
That was a hoot and a half

160
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:33,096
No?

161
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:35,346
(laughing)

162
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:38,500
- Whaaat?!

163
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,234
- Dude okay, you're done alright now it's my turn

164
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:42,534
to impersonate Devin - Alright.

165
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:45,201
Featuring a chair now. - What?!?!

166
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:49,128
- I'm sorry, I'm crying like Collins when I laugh

167
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:50,661
- Okay that is a really good impersonation

168
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:52,667
- This is probably the best impersonation I could do.

169
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:56,535
- I'm Devin Key, I never smile in my selfies

170
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:57,888
- That was pretty accurate, actually.

171
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:58,953
- Yeah that's Devin right there,

172
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,569
there should be one more thing.

173
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,743
Hey so basically I'm really, no (laughing)

174
00:06:02,743 --> 00:06:04,360
That's not at all like you, sorry.

175
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,939
Are we both single?

176
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,102
- And - Yo

177
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:08,427

00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:09,697
- Pretty much yeah, we're very single.

179
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:12,288
Netflix and chill by ourselves, eh!

180
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,656
Not like with each other, but like in separate

181
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:15,940
nevermind, let's move on.

182
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,873
What's up with your sleeping habits?

183
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:20,040
(snoring)

184
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:22,561
Can you say something in French?

185
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:24,231
French toast, okay there we go.

186
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,931
This question is a personal favorite of mine

187
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:28,779
Who can peel and orange the fastest?

188
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:31,537
I think it was supposed to be 'and orange' the fastest,

189
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:33,717
but I like that you said 'and orange' the fastest

190
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:36,127
so let's have a little competition right now.

191
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,315
I have a different strategy. (laughing)

192
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,717
Okay that did not work.

193
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:42,209
- Oh god, ahh

194
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,859
Ants are gonna love this area. - Yep okay great there we go

195
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,032
and, peeled!

196
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,417
That's a very unconventional peeling.

197
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,409
I'm gonna go more traditional now.

198
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,872
- Hey!

199
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:52,592
- This was much more effective, I don't know

200
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:53,943
why I didn't do this the first time.

201
00:06:53,943 --> 00:06:54,850
- Ugh. - Smack cam

202
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,092
I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win!

203
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:58,415
- I think you are, I think you are!

204
00:06:58,415 --> 00:06:59,552
No!

205
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,236
- I peeled a grapefruit the fastest.

206
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:02,603
(grunting)

207
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:05,066
- Obviously I am the better magician here, right?

208
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,089
(gasping)

209
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,900
What, he's gone that's right I'm the best magician here.

210
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,741
No!

211
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:13,331
Put ketchup in your hands and then slap each other.

212
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:15,719
Oh my god dude you have, ah!

213
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:16,728
Got him!

214
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,598
- Oh, you actually got it this time!

215
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:20,936
- I know (laughing)

216
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:24,719
and now it's time for the ketchup cam!

217
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,397
Really gotta load him up.

218
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:28,064
Alright there we go.

219
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:34,323
Okay, okay, okay, okay eh, what are you doing?

220
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:37,900
(spitting noise)

221
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,067
- Ohhhhh god!

222
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,779
I can't hear, I can't hear anything!

223
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,446
- Yeahhh! - Oh my god

224
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:49,039
- Dude chill, chill, chill chill okay alright cool!

225
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,747
Can you lift up the ref--RIGERATOR!

226
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:55,996
(laughing) Yeah you got me good.

227
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:59,730
You got me really good, that was a direct hit!

228
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,855
Battleship down, the answer is no.

229
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:04,699
- I think --

230
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:06,813
Like do you really think that I can lift up the refrige?

231
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:08,471
Oh god, it hurt I'm crying it hurt.

232
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:09,429
- Especially not now

233
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:10,447
- Yeah no I can't lift up a refrigerator.

234
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:11,689
- Do you know how hard it is to laugh and lift something?

235
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:12,522
(laughing)

236
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:14,973
When was the last time you and your brother wore shorts?

237
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:18,312
[Both] Never, we've actually never worn shorts, ever.

238
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:19,695
- Ever.

239
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:21,185
- Can you make this your last question?

240
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:24,256
