1
00:00:00,241 --> 00:00:02,685
(all yell)

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:04,147
- You challenged me to fill this pool

3
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:06,480
with 10,000 pounds of slime.

4
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,338
So right, now I'm gonna need some help.

5
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:10,271
(guests cheer) (air horns bellow)

6
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,429
- What's up?

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,783
Let's go!

8
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:13,949
Oh my God!

9
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,339
- Whoa!

10
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:17,519
(guests laughs)

11
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,869
- All right guys, let's do this.

12
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:21,829
- It's so much slime!

13
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:22,888
Oh my gosh, are you okay?

14
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:24,429
- Are you okay? - Oh my gosh!

15
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:25,987
Instead of dumping each packet of slime

16
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:27,062
individually into the pool,

17
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:28,680
we filled up these buckets right here

18
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,735
with a ton of the powder,

19
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:31,023
and stick around till the very end

20
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:32,974
because we will fully submerge ourselves

21
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:34,815
in the slime at the end of the video.

22
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:36,599
But right now, let's make the slime.

23
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,263
(children cheering)

24
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:40,675
(heavy electronic music)

25
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:41,508
We gotta put this back.

26
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,444
This is so much slime.

27
00:00:42,444 --> 00:00:43,277
(laughs)

28
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,445
Safety is a number one priority, clearly.

29
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,278
Oops.

30
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:47,111
(all laugh)

31
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:47,944
I have a better idea.

32
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:49,517
Oh my gosh, it looks crazy.

33
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:50,485
- [Devan] Whoa.

34
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:53,235
(tropical music)

35
00:00:58,669 --> 00:00:59,502
- All right, so I'm going to go

36
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:00,371
for like the side to side technique,

37
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:02,213
just like, eh, eh.

38
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:03,379
Hey, that actually worked.

39
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:04,689
- [Devan] Oh, that's working.

40
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,522
- Oh, I have an idea.

41
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:06,366
Let me go around the circumference of it.

42
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,211
Kind of like...

43
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:09,067
(laughs)

44
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,608
Yeah.

45
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:11,441
(glass clatters)

46
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:12,274
(all laugh)

47
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:13,107
- [Christian] Kind of like went in my mouth.

48
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:13,940
- You guys want to hop in right now

49
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,989
and start, like, mixing it around?

50
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:15,947
How's it feel?

51
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:17,991
Whoa, be careful, be careful, be careful, be careful, bro!

52
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:18,824
Are you guys good?

53
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:19,657
- It's like walking in a--

54
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:20,505
- Oh! - It's like a bowling alley.

55
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:21,829
- Yeah. - It is like a bowling alley.

56
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:23,277
- Are you good? - Are y'all good?

57
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:24,412
Someone's about to, like, take a nose dive.

58
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:25,832
- We're so gonna fall in this.

59
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:26,665
- How does it feel?

60
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:27,738
- [Christian] Whoa, there's like--

61
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:28,571
- What does it feel like?

62
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:29,885
- Guys, look, guys, look.

63
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:30,992
- What? - There's more at the bottom.

64
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:32,475
- [Collins] Oh my gosh.

65
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:34,131
Oh, that looks so cool.

66
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:35,073
- [Christian] That is so awesome.

67
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:38,629
- [Collins] Dude, it looks just like it.

68
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:40,527
(shouts)

69
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:41,390
- You guys okay?

70
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,473
- I'm good.

71
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:43,306
Look, look, look.

72
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:44,139
- [Group] Whoa.

73
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:45,592
- Wait.

74
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,807
No, and it's not even ready yet.

75
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:48,640
- What is this?

76
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,723
- [Devan] Yo.

77
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:51,776
- It's still powdery. - It's still dry

78
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:52,609
in the middle.

79
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:53,442
- Did you find clumps?

80
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:54,868
- [Devan] Yeah.

81
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:55,963
- I'm like constantly falling over.

82
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:56,796
- [Devan] Yo, this is--

83
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:58,562
- Ew, it feels so gross.

84
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:02,312
There's like seaweed or something at the, ew.

85
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,790
(cheerful music)

86
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:12,378
- [Christian] Whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no.

87
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:13,344
- Whoa! - I'm sorry.

88
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:14,924
- All right guys, well, we are about to all jump

89
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:16,458
into the pool of slime right now

90
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,148
and just kind of go crazy and play around with it.

91
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:20,291
But first, we have a challenge for you.

92
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,097
(all laugh)

93
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:24,566
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel.

94
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:26,141
Turn on the channel post notifications

00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:32,360

Keyper Squad, right now.

101
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,906
- Dude, I feel like an ice skater.

102
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:40,739
I'm like woo!

103
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:41,572
(Ava laughs)

104
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:43,922
- Here we go, everyone hop in, go.

105
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:44,755
(all shout)

106
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:46,858
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay!

107
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:49,770
(Collins shrieks)

108
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,854
- Oh no!

109
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:51,687
Oh!

110
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:55,644
Dude, this looks so cool. - That is so weird.

111
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:57,319
- It's so warm.

112
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,455
- [Collins] This looks so nice.

113
00:02:58,455 --> 00:02:59,480
- It's so weird.

114
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,134
- I love pushups, yeah, oh yeah.

115
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:03,042
- Oh no.

116
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:04,092
Dude, you're spilling half of it again.

117
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:04,925
- I'm sorry.

118
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,146
- [Devan] Oh no, oh no.

119
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:07,979
- I can't get up,

120
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,694
I can't get up. - You wouldn't give me a hug.

121
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:12,527
- I've fallen, and I can't get up.

122
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:15,105
(all scream)

123
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:16,373
- [All] Slime.

124
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:17,547
- Oh my gosh, are you okay?

125
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:18,575
Oh my gosh.

126
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:19,408
(Collins laughs)

127
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,241
Bro!

128
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,246
- I can't hear.

129
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:23,621
- I can't (laughs).

130
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,047
- [Collins] No, bro, are you alright?

131
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:27,187
- [Devan] Yo, look at his hair grease.

132
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,141
(Ava laughs)

133
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,416
- That's a good look, bro.

134
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,257
All right, I want you to think

135
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:32,360
I'm blowing a bubble with it, nope.

136
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,193
To kick it off,

137
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:36,304
we're gonna try riding boogie boards on slime.

138
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:37,546
And this was suggested

139
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:39,160
by the Instagram Keyper of the Week, Tori.

140
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,073
If you want to be featured

141
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:41,131
as the Instagram Keyper of the Week,

142
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,005
check the description down below to find out how.

143
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,436
- Let me do a practice round.

144
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:47,105
- [Collins] Practice round?

145
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,361
- Okay, I got this.

146
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,380
- You should have a running start, dude.

147
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,826
- I should just do it there.

148
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:52,393
- You gotta get a running start.

149
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:54,070
Devan, just know the duck believes in you.

150
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,403
- [All] Three, two, one, go.

151
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,448
(all scream)

152
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,912
- [Collins] He did it!

153
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:05,433
(all scream)

154
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:06,494
(all cheer)

155
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:07,601
I'm gonna take this to the next level, though.

156
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,014
I'm gonna see if I can take the boogie board

157
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:10,672
and jump on it into it.

158
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:11,505
All right, here we go.

159
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:13,505
- [All] Three, two, one.

160
00:04:14,984 --> 00:04:16,390
(all scream)

161
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,723
(all laugh)

162
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:22,755
- We lost half of it. - Oh my gosh!

163
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:26,773
(all scream)

164
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:29,106
(all laugh)

165
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:33,008
- This gets so slippery.

166
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:34,999
- Dude, this is so slippery.

167
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:38,175
- Next up, we are doing a basketball dunk competition.

168
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,686
- Yes! - It's about to get lit.

169
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:41,183
So Bella's going to hold up the basket,

170
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:44,356
and then one by one, we're gonna do our best dunk into it

171
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:45,370
and see who wins.

172
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,203
- Oh God.

173
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,036
(Collins laughs)

174
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:47,989
- Oh no! - Slimed!

175
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:49,511
- [Devan] Yo, that works.

176
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:51,702
- Devan, grab my arms and pull me your way.

177
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:52,564
- You're pulling me.

178
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:53,608
- Everyone gets one attempt

179
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:55,829
and you guys decide in the comments who won.

180
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,755
Ava goes first.

181
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,267
Go for it, three, two, one, go.

182
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:00,608
That's not a dunk! - That's not a dunk!

183
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:03,087
- (laughs) That wasn't a dunk.

184
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:04,789
Immediate disqualification!

185
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,239
All right, well, we broke the board, so yeah!

186
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,380
- I'm gonna do it.

187
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,551
- All right, Christian.

188
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:11,175
Go for it, bro! - Go for it!

189
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:12,935
(all laugh)

190
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:13,935
- He missed.

191
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:16,538
Another disqualification.

192
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:18,688
So far, all Devan has to do is just dunk it.

193
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:19,580
- All right, you ready?

194
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,548
- Yep, go.

195
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:21,465
- [All] Oh!

196
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,163
- Yeah.

197
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:24,996
- [Collins] All right.

198
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:27,907
- Dude, I have a bug stuck to me.

199
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:28,740
- [Collins] Are you good, bro?

200
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,026
- No, it's stuck to me.

201
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:31,013
What do I do?

202
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:32,470
- Here we go, the final dunk.

203
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,803
Three, two, one.

204
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:35,801
(Collins shrieks)

205
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:38,051
(all yell)

206
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,266
(Collins shrieks)

207
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:43,544
(all yell)

208
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:44,633
Did I get it?

209
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,466
- You got it!

210
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:48,229
(Collins cheers)

211
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:49,062
Yeah.

212
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,223
(somber music)

213
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:54,056
- Bro!

214
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:55,730
- All right, guys, you comment down below

215
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,474
who won the dunk contest,

216
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:58,944
and now we're on to the next challenge.

217
00:05:58,944 --> 00:05:59,996
(blows raspberry)

218
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:01,121
Oh gosh, it's in my mouth.

219
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:02,254
- Yeah I know, that's what happened to me.

220
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:03,087
(Collins shrieks)

221
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:05,829
- Next up guys, we are doing the yoga challenge in slime.

222
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:07,504
So first pose right now.

223
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:08,728
Om. (all laugh)

224
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:09,938
- I got it, I nailed it.

225
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:11,931
I nailed it, I nailed it.

226
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:12,764
Woo!

227
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:13,597
- That was impressive, all right.

228
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:14,430
- I can't.

229
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,896
I don't have ground-- - I cannot do that.

230
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:16,729
- [Collins] All right, here we go.

231
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:17,562
(Collins laughs)

232
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:18,500
Bella.

233
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,333
- [Devan] Oh no.

234
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,235
- Next pose guys.

235
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:21,935
It's called the Sleeping Lotus.

236
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:22,991
- What? - Where you hold one leg out

237
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:25,584
in front of you, and then you sleep.

238
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:26,417
- [Devan] What?

239
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,281
- I nailed the pose.

240
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:28,483
(all laugh)

241
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:29,695
I'm doing the splits.

242
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:30,528
(Collins shrieks)

243
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:31,519
- [Devan] I got it.

244
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,803
- Here we go. - Yo, did you see my--

245
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:34,636
- Oh!

246
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:36,553
Where did Bella, Bella.

247
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:38,760
I'm gonna go like this.

248
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,034
- What, no, there's no way.

249
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:40,867
- Here we go.

250
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,700
Give me your hands.

251
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,945
- There's no way. - I got this, bro.

252
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:44,028
- There's no way!

253
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:44,872
- Here we go, you ready?

254
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,041
- You have to be fully submerged.

255
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,057
- I am.

256
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,981
Let's go, three, two--

257
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:49,814
- You have to go like, yeah.

258
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:50,714
- I'm ready one, go.

259
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:53,030
(triumphant music)

260
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,709
My ear, the right ear!

261
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,118
(Ava yells)

262
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:57,451
All right, guys.

263
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:00,810
- Dude, no, no, get the slime!

264
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,830
- Yo, there's, like, slime in my pants.

265
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,367
All right.

266
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,049
Next up is a tug-of-war battle

267
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:08,772
and this side, I guess, it's Ava and I

268
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:10,154
versus Devan, Christian, and Bella.

269
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:10,987
- All right, let's get it.

270
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:11,820
- How this works,

271
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,683
whichever team goes down first, they are the losers,

272
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,564
and they have to get blasted in the face

273
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:17,197
with a squirt gun filled of slime.

274
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:18,030
- [All] What?

275
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,863
- Here we go.

276
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:21,635
We're going in three, two, one, go.

277
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:23,120
- No, that doesn't count.

278
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,424
It doesn't count, it doesn't count, no.

279
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:27,073
- Yes!

280
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:27,906
Yes!

281
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,688
- No, no. - Yes, yes.

282
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:33,609
- [Christian] It's Collins with the lead.

283
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:35,377
- I can't do anything.

284
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:37,062
I can't do anything.

285
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:39,041
- That was so close.

286
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,191
Yes, now just Bella's left.

287
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:42,797
(Collins and Ava cheer)

288
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,555
That was underdog, a true underdog victory.

289
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:48,484
- [Christian] I'm sorry guys, I'm sorry.

290
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:49,743
- Let's get the squirt guns.

291
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:51,252
All right, so we're gonna hop out of the pool

292
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:53,040
and then squirt them from outside the pool,

293
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,259
'cause victory!

294
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:55,416
- But how long, though?

295
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,533
I can only take so much.

296
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:58,126
- I'm trying to get all this off of me.

297
00:07:58,126 --> 00:07:58,959
- I got you, I got you.

298
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,792
- [Collins] All right, here we go.

299
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:00,706
I'm gonna fill it up.

300
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:02,243
- I got you (screams). - Oh my gosh, it's working.

301
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:04,484
- No, that's not a good sign.

302
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,476
That's not a good sign!

303
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:07,374
- Here we go, three, two, one.

304
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:08,207
(defeated music)

305
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:10,451
No, no, it doesn't come out.

306
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:12,815
(cheers)

307
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:14,095
I need to try it again, I need to try it again.

308
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:15,064
- Yes.

309
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:15,897
Woo-hoo.

310
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:21,279
- (laughs) You know, forget this.

311
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,196
(Isabella screams)

312
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,332
- It's not going anywhere.

313
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:29,688
(Collins shrieks)

314
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:31,204
- Oopsy!

315
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:32,633
- Get away, get away!

316
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:33,770
Ava's a maniac

317
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,725
(screams)

318
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:36,426
- Oh jeez! - Oh no!

319
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:38,843
- Get his hair, get his hair.

320
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:41,684
Coming for Devan's hair.

321
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:43,434
I got Ava, I'm sorry.

322
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:47,850
(all laugh)

323
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,814
Oh my gosh.

324
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:49,647
Well.

325
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,159
- My stomach is hurting.

326
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,054
I'm laughing so hard.

327
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:59,577
- All right, guys, I think we go on to the next challenge.

328
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:02,474
(Christian shrieks)

329
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:03,724
I'm sorry, bro.

330
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:06,829
- Ah, it touched my mouth.

331
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:07,662
(blows raspberry)

332
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:09,064
- Guys, guys, guys, look. - What?

333
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:10,241
- Look how much slime is in my hair.

334
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,324
- [All] Whoa.

335
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,325
- That is so gross.

336
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:15,238
What does it feel like, though?

337
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,538
Is it, like, just super

338
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:17,371
- It's soft.

339
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:18,526
It's like smooth - Wait, hold on.

340
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:19,359
- I wonder if it's good for your hair.

341
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,540
- I can't even feel your hair.

342
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,982
Like, I can't feel the individual strands.

343
00:09:21,982 --> 00:09:23,628
- It's like a string of the slime.

344
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:24,847
- Yeah, it's like a giant string of slime.

345
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:26,708
- Oh, that is awesome.

346
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,541
What?

347
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,624
- For this final part here,

348
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,823
we are going to be doing a King of the Hill battle

349
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:34,132
on this massive duck right here,

350
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:35,755
and so, at the end of 30 seconds,

351
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,868
whoever is still left on the duck,

352
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,020
if I can even get it in here,

353
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,503
they win the battle, all right?

354
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:41,385
But before we do this,

355
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:42,218
if you wanna be featured

356
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:43,850
in the next video, comment down below

357
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,108
how many pounds of Orbeez should we fill the pool with?

358
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,742
And right now, here we go.

359
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:51,017
- Is it gone or what? - Three, two, one.

360
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:51,850
- Go! - No!

361
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,540
- Oh my gosh.

362
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,528
Get the duck, get the duck.

363
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:00,335
(Devan and Collins laugh)

364
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:02,502
- [Devan] I want it, mine!

365
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:06,584
I've got this!

366
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:07,501
- Yes, yes!

367
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,178
- [Collins] I love you, Ducky.

368
00:10:10,178 --> 00:10:11,872
I got you by the head.

369
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:13,636
(Collins screams)

370
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:14,612
(all scream)

371
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,558
- What time is it!

372
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:17,891
What time is it!

373
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:21,767
- Three, two, one.

374
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:25,239
No.

375
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:27,240
No!

376
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:29,308
Well.

377
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,458
- Woo!

378
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,659
- Christian, don't put it back, no.

379
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:36,626
(Christian yells)

380
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:37,459
- All right, guys,

381
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:38,941
(Devan grunts)

382
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:41,047
All right, guys, thank you so much for watching

383
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:42,461
and right now, time to submerge ourselves.

384
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:45,294
Three, two, one, bye. - What, wait.

385
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,184
(Collins shrieks)

386
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:49,791
- This is terrible.

387
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,624
I can't see anything.

388
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:52,409
- I can't see. - I can't see.

389
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:53,377
(all shout)

390
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:56,403
- It's in my mouth, it's in my mouth.

391
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:57,236
(all scream)

392
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:58,585
- All right.

393
00:10:58,585 --> 00:10:59,585
- [All] Bye.

394
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,107
(blows raspberry)

395
00:11:02,107 --> 00:11:02,940
- What's with my life?

396
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,855
I've done this five times!
