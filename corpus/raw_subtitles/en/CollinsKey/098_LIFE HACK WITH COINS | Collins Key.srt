00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- What's up, guys?

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,097
It's Collins Key and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:05,572
For today's video, I'm showing you guys and teaching you

4
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,455
a brand new lifehack that I figured out

5
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:09,661
with a quarter and a bit of fire.

6
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:12,226
Now, if you're under the age of 18, don't try this.

7
00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:13,330
I don't want you getting hurt.

8
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,492
If you're over the age of 18,

9
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:16,231
just be very careful you don't burn yourself.

10
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:19,017
That being said, let's jump into this awesome lifehack.

11
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:20,744
You're gonna take your coin,

12
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:23,556
and just heat it up just like this.

13
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:27,312
Just enough and you actually soften the metal of this coin.

14
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:29,257
So if you soften it enough, you can do this.

15
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:31,090
Watch, you can take it

16
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:34,423
(snap)

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,024
and actually bite off a piece of the quarter.

18
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:40,854
And that's not even the craziest part.

19
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:42,152
(blows)

20
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:44,519
When this coin gets cool enough, it turns into putty.

21
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:45,352
Watch.

22
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:48,741
(blows)

23
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:49,574
(chuckles)

24
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:51,206
The piece will reattach itself to the coin.

25
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:52,637
You guys can spend the money.

26
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:53,480
If you guys love this and you

27
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,960
want your friends to try it out,

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,509
share this video with them right now

29
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:58,248
and give the video a big thumbs-up.

30
00:00:58,248 --> 00:01:00,250
If you want me to do even more crazy lifehacks like this,

31
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,191
comment down below.

32
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:03,114
What other random objects should I use

33
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:04,461
in these lifehack videos?

34
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:06,134
And make sure you guys are subscribed to this channel

35
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:07,731
because, if you didn't know, I've got new videos

36
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:09,767
coming out each and every single Thursday.

37
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:11,521
For right now, I'm gonna go eat some more quarters.

38
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,788
I'll see you guys again next week.

39
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:13,621
Bye.
