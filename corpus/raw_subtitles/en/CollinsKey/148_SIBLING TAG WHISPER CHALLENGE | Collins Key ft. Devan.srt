1
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:01,094
- There's a bee right there.

2
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:02,003
- Oh frick.

3
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,187
What's up guys it's Collins, for

4
00:00:03,187 --> 00:00:04,429
today's video I thought it'd be

5
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:06,095
kinda fun to do a challenge, but

6
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:07,320
I can't do this challenge alone.

7
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,153
So I need someone to help me out.

8
00:00:08,153 --> 00:00:09,236
- [Both] Hey!

9
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:11,322
- The brother is back.

10
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:12,155
- What up.

11
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:12,988
(grunts)

12
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:14,969
- We are going to be doing the whisper challenge.

13
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,217
And this was started by Joe Sugg.

14
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:17,430
And since it's kinda Halloween time,

15
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,736
I'm gonna add a Halloween spin to it.

16
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:20,187
Devan will put on his headphones.

17
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,342
So turn on some super loud music,

18
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:22,619
so he can't hear what I'm saying.

19
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:23,791
And then I'm gonna say a sentence

20
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,167
to him that has to do with Halloween.

21
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:27,018
And he has to read my lips and

22
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:28,475
try and figure out what I'm saying.

23
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:30,553
He's totally distracted by beat drop right now.

24
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:31,824
Alright let's get started, whoa!

25
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:32,921
He's ready to go.

26
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:35,370
Trick-Or-treat, my names Pete,

27
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,191
give me candy or smell my feet.

28
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:39,114
- I got it, I got it.

29
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:39,947
- What?

30
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:42,120
- Trick-Or-Treat, my name is Pete.

31
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,351
- Yes.

32
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,350
- Give me candy or smell my feet.

33
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,938
- What the heck, how did you get that?

34
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:47,771
(laughs)

35
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:48,706
- I can't hear anything!

36
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:49,861
His ears are about to die.

37
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:51,341
- I guess so.

38
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:53,245
Oh that's so loud.

39
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:54,655
- It hurts, so bad.

40
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,595
Dracula.

41
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:56,924
- Dracula, wait hold on.

42
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,642
- I haven't finished.

43
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,475
- What?

44
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:00,308
- I haven't finished.

45
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:01,648
- Wait, wait, wait, Dracula finished.

46
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:02,786
Dracula just let me finish.

47
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:03,634
- No, no, no, start over, start over.

48
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:07,905
- Dracula cannot be in the sun or else he will burn.

49
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:11,562
- Dracula likes to sleep on a wooden board!

50
00:01:11,562 --> 00:01:13,094
(laughs)

51
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:14,081
- What?

52
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:15,840
Dracula cannot.

53
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,151
- Dracula cannot.

54
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:18,916
- Yeah, be in the sun.

55
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,416
- Pee in the stool.

56
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,806
(laughs)

57
00:01:21,806 --> 00:01:22,775
- What?

58
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:24,622
- You articulate words, you're like.

59
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:26,998
- I'm trying to help, be in the sun.

60
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:28,598
- Be in the sun!

61
00:01:28,598 --> 00:01:30,434
- Yes, or else he will burn.

62
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:33,319
- Or outside at night, no?

63
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,217
- Or else he will burn.

64
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:36,279
- Or at a sleepover.

65
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:38,200
(laughs)

66
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,169
- Or else he will burn!

67
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:40,002
- Yes thank you!

68
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:40,835
- Okay.

69
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:41,668
- Thank you.

70
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,501
- At the Halloween party.

71
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:43,348
- At the Halloween party.

72
00:01:43,348 --> 00:01:44,596
- I haven't even finished my sentence

73
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:46,784
yet, let me finish, at the Halloween party,

74
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:49,451
Dracula jumped in the punch bowl

75
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:52,414
and drank all of the blood.

76
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:55,066
- A the Halloween party, Dracula jumped

77
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:58,415
in the pool and drank all of the blood.

78
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:00,586
- That's still so frickin' close.

79
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:03,726
Dracula jumped in the punch, punch like punch.

80
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:04,974
- Dracula punched?

81
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:07,876
- No, no, no, no, Dracula jumped in the punch bowl.

82
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:09,867
- Oh, oh, in the punch pool!

83
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:11,718
- No, punch bowl.

84
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:12,948
- Oh bunch bowl.

85
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:14,498
- Punch, punch bowl.

86
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:17,139
- So Dracula dove into the punch bowl.

87
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,252
- Yeah, and drank all of the blood.

88
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:20,761
- And drank all of the blood.

89
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:21,852
- Yeah.

90
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:22,844
(moaning)

91
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:24,081
No, I think I will lose all my

92
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:25,526
hearing by the time this videos over.

93
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:26,820
(groans)

94
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,428
(laughs)

95
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:30,761
- Can you hear me?

96
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:33,036
Nope, pumpkin spice lattes.

97
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,644
- Pumpkin spice delight.

98
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:35,480
- Oh my God.

99
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,530
- No okay, sorry, go.

100
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,921
- Let me finish, pumpkin spice lattes

101
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:42,067
are all the rage with girls my age.

102
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:46,728
- Pumpkin spice lactates are rage with kids my age.

103
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:47,732
(laughs)

104
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:50,338
- They're not lactates, latte.

105
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,567
- Oh, pumpkin spice lattes are

106
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:54,517
all the rage with kids my age.

107
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:55,350
- Yes.

108
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,409
- Okay, nice, good job.

109
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,808
- Yeet, yeet, ya-yeet.

110
00:02:57,808 --> 00:03:01,261
- I think Eduardo the zombie is in love with our mother.

111
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:02,886
(laughs)

112
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:05,388
- I think I know what the topic is.

113
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:06,221
- What no!

114
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,054
(laughs)

115
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:07,887
Not even.

116
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,598
(incoherent whispers)

117
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:11,821
- Dude we're doing a video, dude come here, we're

118
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:14,786
shooting a, dude, hey, hey, hey, sit down, sit down.

00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:15,619
Relax.

I think.

121
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:17,456
- I think.

122
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:18,779
- Eduardo.

123
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,027
- Eduardo.

124
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:20,860

127
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:24,932
- What, am I yelling right now?

128
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:25,765
- Yeah, you're yelling.

129
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:26,598
- Okay.

130
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:27,431
- Trick-Or-Treat.

131
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:28,420
- Do I like horseshoes?

132
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,498
(laughs)

133
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:31,769
- How is that?

134
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:32,669
- I can't hear anything.

135
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,514
(laughs)

136
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,016
This beat drop, this beat drops insane!

137
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,798
Oh it's crazy!

138
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:40,069

139
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:41,821
- Do I like groceries?

140
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,321
- Oh my gosh, you're terrible at this game.

141
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:46,571
Trick-Or-Treat.

142
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:48,775
- Do I like horseshoes?

143
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:52,048

144
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:53,116
- Oh, trick-or-treat!

145
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:54,143

146
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:55,885
- Smell my moms feet.

147
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:57,011
- Smell my moms feet.

00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:10,842
- No.

157
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:11,683

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,468
Alright, last one, always fear when

161
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:17,791
smelly pumpkins are near.

162
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,260
- Halloween action figures.

163
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,159

164
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,523
- Smelly pumpkins are near is what I meant to say.

165
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:24,773
- Always fear smelly pumpkins are here.

166
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:27,324
