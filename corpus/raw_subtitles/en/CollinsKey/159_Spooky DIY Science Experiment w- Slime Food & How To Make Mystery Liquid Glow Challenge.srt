1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,729
- You challenged us to make slime, out of pumpkin guts!

2
00:00:02,729 --> 00:00:03,687
- Pumpkin!

3
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:04,596
- [Together] Oh!

4
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:06,070
- Right now, let's go!

5
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,812
- To kick things off, we have to gut out the pumpkin,

6
00:00:07,812 --> 00:00:09,908
so I'm gonna use this carving tool right here.

7
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:11,952
- And, I'm gonna use Victor, the laser pony.

8
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:13,676
It's super complicated to get it started,

9
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:15,602
but I just got to figure out the initiation process here.

10
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:16,587
- Do you have to figure it out?

11
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:17,696
This sounds dangerous bro.

12
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:18,529
How do you do it? - It's actually

13
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:20,398
super difficult, you basically have to press here.

14
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:21,665
Three, two, one!

15
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:22,748
(soft music)

16
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:26,415
- [Both] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:31,667
- Whoa!

18
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:33,566
- Now, it's time to ride off into the sunset.

19
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,417
- Which way is the sun?

20
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:35,250
- Victor, which way?

21
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,083
This way.

22
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:36,916
Woo hoo!

23
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,295
- All right, now it's time to remove the tops.

24
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:40,025
Dude what, no, no, no, no, no!

25
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:40,858
You remove it!

26
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:41,939
- Oh! - Look at that bro!

27
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:45,999
Dude, looks like a weird, like chunky kind of jellyfish.

28
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:46,832
(laser)

29
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:48,787
All right, I think I've got to snip out some

30
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,319
whoa, jeez it's like a witch's broom.

31
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:52,204
Yo, this is a real flying broomstick,

32
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:54,543
dude it's the Dingus 2000!

33
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:55,376
- Wow!

34
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:57,069
- Now with built in air Wifi!

35
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:58,608
I can actually fly with no video tricks.

36
00:00:58,608 --> 00:00:59,858
check this out!

37
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:03,639
- Whoa, dude are you okay, bro?

38
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:04,662
(glass shatters)

39
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:05,495
- Oh, man!

40
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:07,578
Oh no, I broke my Dingus!

41
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:10,364
It's fine.

42
00:01:10,364 --> 00:01:11,822
Alright, now it is time to carve this out right now,

43
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,629
so let's, get in here and let's get juicy.

44
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:14,462
(evil laughter)

45
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:15,295
I'm just going in with my hands,

46
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:17,271
so let's see how this feels.

47
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:19,772
It's like the weird reverse of slime almost.

48
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:21,004
- Mine's fully gutted.

49
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:22,519
Next step is to make the pumpkin slime,

50
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,080
so we're going to take this clear glue here,

51
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,677
and add it into our pumpkin guts.

52
00:01:25,677 --> 00:01:27,255
I've never done this before, it's gonna be weird.

53
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,086
- Pumpkin purification first,

54
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:30,952
booga, booga, booga.

55
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,639
Now, I just have to heat up my glue,

56
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,269
so to do this I'm going to bring back Victor,

57
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:35,171
the laser pony!

58
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:37,593
But, now I have to dial it back, I don't want laser mode,

59
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:39,938
so I'm just going to dial back the laser eye,

60
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:41,067
and again I'm going to press here.

61
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,695
(laser)

62
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:45,238
Done, and now we can add it in, so here we go,

63
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,196
just gonna dump it in.

64
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,594
Time to go in with the hands.

65
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:48,427
Oh!

66
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:49,260
(sounds of disgust)

67
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,111
- Stop, flow, in.

68
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:50,944
Perfect!

69
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,777
Alright, first off we're gonna go in with

70
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,254
a little skeleton dude, see what he thinks of it.

71
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:54,462
You ready?

72
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:55,395
- Hey, what man?

73
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:56,228
Watch the bones!

74
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:58,836
- Oh, you are not joking, bro, this feels super crazy.

75
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:01,055
Yeah, I added way, way, way too much

76
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,945
of everything into this thing dude.

77
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:03,852
No!

78
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:05,531
Just listen to those sounds!

79
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:07,993
- Now it's time to add the slime, to the pumpkin.

80
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:10,988
- Okay, here we go, almost getting it in, oh snap!

81
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:12,425
- Why did I make my hole so small?!

82
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:15,138
- Now it's time to seal off the top, like this, perfect.

83
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:16,243
Like a glove!

84
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:19,735
- Now it's time to carve it out, and watch the slime ooze.

85
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,324
Starting with the eyes first.

86
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:22,958
- Well, that's not going to work, so, fleet.

87
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,882
I wonder if the slime is going to come pouring out.

88
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:25,824
This'll be nuts!

89
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:27,342
I'm we're just gonna go for the eyeballs now.

90
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:28,487
Ooh, it's starting to happen!

91
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:31,358
- Oh, not really any slime at all.

92
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:32,508
- Ooh, ooh, it's happening!

93
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:33,923
Adding the mouth is really where it's going to happen,

94
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:35,138
so here we go.

95
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:36,369
I don't know how to carve the mouth.

96
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:37,522
- Alright, my mouth is done!

97
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:40,019
- Dude, it might literally, explode out of this thing.

98
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:40,852
You ready?

99
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:42,685
- [Both] Three, two, one!

100
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,197
- Yo!

101
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,030
It came right out!

102
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,555
Oh my gosh, it's just going, and going, and going.

103
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:48,388
Wait, is yours not out yet?

104
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:49,516
- No, in three, two, one!

105
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:50,516
- [Both] Oh!

106
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:53,671
- Dude, keep it in.

107
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:54,504
Try to keep it in!

108
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:57,037
- Bro, control yourself bro, control your bladder,

109
00:02:57,037 --> 00:02:59,866
or stomach, or whatever this is, this is not a bladder,

110
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:01,389
I don't know how pumpkin's anatomy works.

111
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,282
You get to comment down below who made a crazier pumpkin,

112
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:06,704
and right now guys we are on to the next round.

113
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:08,048
Check this out!

114
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:09,421
- Whoa, nice!

115
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:10,254
Ah, jeez! - Right now,

116
00:03:10,254 --> 00:03:11,848
we're gonna show you how to make some poppers, what.

117
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:13,071
Oh no, let's go!

118
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:14,223
First off, we need ice!

119
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:15,056
- Whoa, wait, what, no!

120
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:16,438
- Here we go, we just need some ice.

121
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:17,271
- We need dry ice!

122
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:18,680
- Don't worry I got you, here we go!

123
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,372
- No, dude that's not how you make dry ice, bro.

124
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:22,557
- Yeah, I'm drying the ice off bro, this is a dryer!

125
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:25,469
Yeah, I guess we don't need the dryer anymore so, deet!

126
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:28,105
- Oh, Collins, this is not what we need!

127
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:29,602
- Well, maybe if it's in smaller pieces?

128
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:31,180
- No, no, that makes no sense!

129
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,759
- Close your eyes, and trust me.

130
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,592
- I don't trust you!

131
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:35,026
You pinky promise me you're not going to do anything bad?

132
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:36,690
- Nothing bad.

133
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,857
(screams)

134
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:42,065
Oh, jeez!

135
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:43,252
- Now, you put on your protective gloves.

136
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:44,085
- Got it.

137
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:44,958
- No, they're not gloves!

138
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,791
- Fleet, fleet!

139
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,139
- Dude, this stuff is no joke!

140
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,754
Dry ice is serious business,

141
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:49,928
and if you need somebody's help,

142
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:52,203
make sure to ask them, and wear protective gloves.

143
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:54,180
- Yes, do not touch this stuff with your bare hands!

144
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,140
- Dude, it's steaming!

145
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,493
- Oh, it's already smoking!

146
00:03:57,493 --> 00:04:00,582
- So, next up, you grab a mallet, and break it.

147
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:01,713
(hammer thuds) (screams)

148
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:04,501
(screaming)

149
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,736
- Now, this is the size piece you want.

150
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:07,871
- Oh, snap!

151
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:08,704
(blowing)

152
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:09,537
- What are you doing!?

153
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:11,354
Dude, it's like an iceberg!

154
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:12,606
- Dude, it looks kind of looks like a jellyfish,

155
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:14,187
blowing through the ocean, just chilling.

156
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,020
It's like, aye!

157
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,253
(flowing water)

158
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:17,671
Well, guys I got my container,

159
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:19,771
so I'm gonna pop the top off like that, alright, perfect.

160
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:20,625
So now-

161
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,842
- First up you add the water!

162
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,379
- Add the water!

163
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,198
- Pour the water in, get your top ready,

164
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,088
because you're gonna need it.

165
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:27,141
- Alright, so I guess we're gonna put this in,

166
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,087
and it's going to pop off in the count of three.

167
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:30,503
- Yeah, I think that's too big, bro.

168
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,336
- What?

169
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:33,444
I'm trying to go for a crazy pop off, bro, here we go.

170
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:34,481

- Mine got stuck!

181
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,577
Mine's stuck, dude!

182
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,298
(suspenseful music)

183
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,487
- Oh, oh no, it's not gonna fall off!

184
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,579
- Oh, there it goes!

185
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,200
(screams)

186
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,290
- Oh my gosh!

187
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,787
(panicking and screaming)

188
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,370
- Oh, it did again.

189
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:09,064
Oh, wait what?

190
00:05:09,064 --> 00:05:10,325
Oh my gosh!

191
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:11,158
Dude!

192
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:13,075
It's like a magic potion, I feel like I'm an evil witch.

193
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:14,131
(witch laughter)

194
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:15,509
It's an evil spell!

195
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:16,480
- All aboard!

196
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,223
(train horn honking)

197
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:19,650
- Choo, choo!

198
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,064
(train horn honking)

199
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:21,947
Alright, now I'm going to put a top on mine,

200
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,326
let's see if it works, one last time.

201
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:24,159
Three, Two, One.

202
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,228
(crickets chirping)

203
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:26,061
Please?

204
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:26,894
Please?

205
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:29,707
(game show music)

206
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:31,458
Welcome to pumpkin poppers, the only game,

207
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,117
where we try to pop this thing thingy,

208
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:34,051
into the top of that thing.

209
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:35,465
- Basically, we take these caps,

210
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:36,599
and we try to get them into there.

211
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:37,432
- That's it!

212
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:39,189
- That's the game.

213
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:40,532
- First player to get a top in wins the game!

214
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:41,365
Let me see if I can get this!

215
00:05:41,365 --> 00:05:42,198
- [Both] Oh!

216
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:43,031
- Oh man, I didn't get it!

217
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:43,864
- You can't even aim them!

218
00:05:43,864 --> 00:05:44,697
- [Both] Oh!

219
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:46,655
- So close! - That was so close!

220
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:47,488
- No!

221
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:48,321
I need this win!

222
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:49,608
- Oh!

223
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:50,663
- [Both] Oh!

224
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:51,751
- I'm going for a different strategy here,

225
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,369
I'm just gonna put tops on all of them.

226
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:54,424
- How did you get so many?

227
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:55,257
- I just got 'em all quickly,

228
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:56,694
so here we go, alright let's see if this is gonna...

229
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:57,527
- Come on!

230
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:58,360
Oh, that was so close!

231
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,265
Man, this is going great, this is working perfectly!

232
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:01,098
- Come on!

233
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:01,955
- Oh!

234
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:03,008
I got it!

235
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:03,966
Yes!

236
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:05,369
- [Race Announcer] And there you have it, folks,

237
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:08,397
Collins winning, one to zero!

238
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:10,421
Devan, not having it!

239
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:11,462
- You shoulda used this one bro,

240
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:12,420
that's your losing thing.

241
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,524
That's what you get for losing.

242
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:14,499
- What's a losing thing?

243
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,590
- It's a losing,

244
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,423
(screams)

245
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:17,256
- Oh, dude!

246
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:18,644
- Alright guys, well that is it for this round,

247
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,492
you get to comment down below,

248
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:20,631
who do you think made cooler poppers

249
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,453
and we are on to the next one!

250
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:25,096
- You challenged us to make monster eyeballs out of slime,

251
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:26,726
that glow in the dark, so check this out, bro.

252
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:27,934
Turn off the lights!

253
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:28,767
(screams)

254
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:29,600
- Turn on the lights!

255
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,433
Turn on the lights, bro!

256
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,266
Turn on the lights!

257
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,391
Dude, oh my goodness!

258
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,602
You're back to normal now.

259
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,493
- I was glowing in the dark.

260
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,234
- No, you were a scary clown, bro!

261
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:37,067
- No way!

262
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:37,900
I think you're seeing things!

263
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,555
Alright, well right now here is how you make 'em!

264
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:41,421
First off we've got to make a slime type process.

265
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,522
Those are, we needed those!

266
00:06:42,522 --> 00:06:44,670
- I'll throw a little eyeball at you!

267
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,503
- Ah!

268
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,447
- We've got some glue we've got to add.

269
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,961
Yo, this reminds me of a quick draw from a western movie.

270
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:50,259
- What are you even doing, bro?

271
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:51,092
(western music)

272
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:51,925
- What are you talking about, boy?!

273
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:52,758
- Oh, jeez!

274
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:53,660
- Queue the tumbleweed!

275
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,588
- The what?!

276
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:55,683
- The tumbleweed!

277
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,424
(shooting)

278
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:59,979
- Well, you have one major weakness.

279
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,355
(screams)

280
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,403
Yeet!

281
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:03,236
- That's my hair.

282
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:04,698
Hey, it landed perfectly!

283
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:06,631
- I've added my two parts glue, now it's time for

284
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:07,524
one part cornstarch.

285
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:08,465
- We got to straighten it out first.

286
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:10,313
A little armpit grab, you know just, grip it.

287
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:11,734
- Why do you strain everything?

288
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:12,587
- This is crazy!

289
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:14,288
- I can't concentrate while my armpit squeeze is on point.

290
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:15,338
Alright, it's getting strained out.

291
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:16,171
Glue's slipping.

292
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:18,004
Devan, grab the glue!

293
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:18,837
(shouting)

294
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:19,670
Dude!

295
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,503
You didn't even help me at all!

296
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:22,147
- I thought you had better grip strength, bro.

297
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:23,232
- Oh, snap!

298
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:25,413
I'm turning you back into, Tiny Devan.

299
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:26,246
- No, no!

300
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,700
It's a little extreme. - Three, two, one, poof!

301
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,872
- Ha, didn't work again!

302
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:31,448
(both screaming)

303
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:33,224
Dude, what did you do this time!

304
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:34,057
Bro!

305
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:34,890
Fix this!

306
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,723
- Easy, I can fix this,

307
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:36,856
hold out your arm, hold out your arm.

308
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:37,689
Three, two, one.

309
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:40,135
(screaming)

310
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:40,968
Oh, man!

311
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:42,782
- Dude, they're not even even anymore!

312
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:44,846
- Devan, Devan, Devan, stay with me!

313
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:46,260
(screaming)

314
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,104
Oh, my gosh you're heavy.

315
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:48,234
(choking)

316
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,067
three, two, one.

317
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,540
(bones cracking)

318
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,108
- You just did the same exact thing!

319
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:54,250
- I'm sorry Devan, these are not turning out!

320
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,264
I'm just going to pop them back in!

321
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:56,935
Three, two, one!

322
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,685
(both screaming)

323
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,281
Oh my gosh, Devan, I am so sorry,

324
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,307
I am gonna change you back right now, I am so sorry!

325
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:05,140
Here we go!

326
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,278
- Three, face forward, two, one!

327
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,111
(screaming)

328
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:09,287
- Dude, what happened!?

329
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:10,701
I feel like I kind of blacked out!

330
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,657
Dude, I kinda remember skeleton hands,

331
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:13,989
or something, I don't know.

332
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:15,566
- Okay, we're adding some cornstarch right now,

333
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:16,661
maybe a little bit more glue,

334
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:17,851
and then time to mix this whole thing around.

335
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:20,013
- No, no, no, two parts glue, one part cornstarch.

336
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:21,055
- That's two parts, bro, here we go.

337
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:22,505
- That's like four parts glue, really?

338
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:23,602
That's not effective.

339
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:24,975
- Hey, it looks kind of like Santa Clause now.

340
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:25,808
(bells jingling)

341
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:27,486
- No, he's like a scary dude.

342
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,340
Next you add the food coloring.

343
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,518
- Now it's time to mix it up!

344
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:32,019
Alright, here we go, I got the top off.

345
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:34,555
We're just gonna add some neon yellow into this thing,

346
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,013
'cause these are gonna be glow in the dark.

347
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:37,023
Alright, that should be good.

348
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:38,356
Next up, we got some Borax.

349
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:40,262
So, we're just going to add this into a bowl right now,

350
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:41,273
this stuff is hard to work with.

351
00:08:41,273 --> 00:08:44,634
Oh no, I forgot it's my megaphone.

352
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:45,690
- Hello!

353
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,523
- Alright, that's enough of that.

354
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:48,062
Alright, so now we're going to add some water in.

355
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:48,895
- How much water?

356
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,895
- That much!

357
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:52,772
I got glue on my lip!

358
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:54,187
- What's the next step, Collins?

359
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,038
- The next step, Devan,

360
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:59,174
is to use a surprisingly heavy trumpet.

361
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:00,713
(dubstep music)

362
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:01,546
Haha!

363
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:03,299
Next up, we're going to add the slime into the Borax,

364
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,353
and this is where we turn it into the balls.

365
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:06,729
Dump it in like this, so here we go.

366
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:07,744
That looks so crazy!

367
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:08,881
- Wow!

368
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,389
- Yo, it like, turned into slime immediately!

369
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,085
- It's actually turning harder, bro!

370
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,636
- I know it's almost turning into a bouncy ball consistency!

371
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:17,742
This is like a homemade DIY bouncy ball, bro!

372
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:19,039
Have you done the bounce test yet?

373
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,872
- No.

374
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:21,606
- [Both in unison] Three, two, one!

375
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:22,978
(both exclaiming)

376
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:23,811
- Alright, it's back.

377
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:24,644
Alright, here we go.

378
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:26,054
- So, to pass the test, it's time to add it into here.

379
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:27,193
- So, here we go, I'm just going to put it into here, like-

380
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,026
(screams)

381
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,375
Alright, I'm just going to squish it in like this.

382
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,824
Ball number one is done.

383
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:31,657
(twinkling sound effect)

384
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:33,086
Yo, these things turned out so cool, and they

385
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:35,169
literally bouncing where's Devan at?

386
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:36,002
(gasp)

387
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:36,913
No! It's Tiny Devan.

388
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:39,008
Okay, Tiny Devan, try to catch the ball, are you ready?

389
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:40,039
Three, two, one!

390
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,872
- No, no, no, no!

391
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:41,705
(gasps)

392
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,442
- Oh my gosh, I smacked his face!

393
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:44,879
Right now we are on to the next round!

394
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,712
(throws ball at Collins)

395
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:47,628
Oh my gosh, yo, Tiny Devan, you got to relax, bro!

396
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,907
- You challenged us to make elephant toothpaste!

397
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:50,959
- And I've got the toothbrush!

398
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,447
- Wait, what, is that for an elephant?

399
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:53,280
- Yeah!

400
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,342
- There's no elephants in this video.

401
00:09:54,342 --> 00:09:55,175
- What?

402
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,612
- Yeah, it's just really big toothpaste.

403
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:57,748
- Well, I've got some regular toothpaste,

404
00:09:57,748 --> 00:09:58,918
right now, let's go!

405
00:09:58,918 --> 00:09:59,751
(toothpaste squirting)

406
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:00,831
Oh, direct hit!

407
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,824
Safety goggles on, and do not try this at home!

408
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:06,488
So, first steps first, we've got hydrogen peroxide here,

409
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:08,835
and we need to add some soap to it, so one squirt

410
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:11,377
for the small one, here we go, and then two squirts

411
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,483
for the big one, here we go.

412
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:13,329
One, two.

413
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:15,143
Next up, we're going to add the color.

414
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:17,897
Dude, these are going to go everywhere, I can't

415
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:18,910
believe we're doing this in our kitchen!

416
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,743
This is not a good idea!

417
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:20,576
- Dude I know!

418
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,562
- This is going to create a huge eruption, so we've got

419
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:24,833
two different sized beakers, so we can see two different

420
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,857
sized eruptions, and maybe this one will actually be

421
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:27,940
bigger than this one.

422
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,773
- Wait, what?

423
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:30,175
- Be very careful, you got to mix them up like this.

424
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,546
Just, stir them around a little bit.

425
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:32,397
- I'll stir that one real quick.

426
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:33,230
- Thank you, Devan.

427
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,109
We now have the catalyst, and it's the moment of truth,

428
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:36,891
the big moment Devan, are you ready?

429
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:37,724
- I'm ready!

430
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,676
- Get positioned, we only have one shot at this.

431
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:42,994
Three, two, wait, if you want to win a 15 minute

432
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:46,677
video call with Devan and I, text the word TRICK to 81800,

433
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:49,071
right now, so pause the video text the word TRICK to

434
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:51,781
81800, and you will automatically be entered in to win,

435
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:53,372
right now, let's go!

436
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:55,946
- [Both in unison] Three, two, one!

437
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,779
(shouting)

438
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:57,885
- Dude, it went everywhere!

439
00:10:57,885 --> 00:11:01,840
(screaming in slow mo)

440
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,172
- Holy cow!

441
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:04,633
Dude, that was crazy!

442
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:05,807
- That's insane!

443
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:07,262
- Bro, that stuff was wild!

444
00:11:07,262 --> 00:11:09,362
Alright guys, that works so good!

445
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:11,503
- It's like cotton candy that's steaming!

446
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:13,733
- It's like steaming, bro, this is real toothpaste

447
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:14,566
right now!

448
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:15,399
Oh my gosh!

449
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,962
Alright guys, you get to comment down below which

450
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:19,683
color was the coolest of this stuff, it is steaming

451
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:21,914
it is so hot right now, we are on to the next one!

452
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:22,914
Bubble time!

453
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,725
- Whoa, bro, your head!

454
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:28,356
- [In High Pitched Voice] Hello guys, right now we're

455
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:31,161
going to see how to make a giant dry ice bubble!

456
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:32,670
- Dude, what!?

457
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,676
(sneezes)

458
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:35,509
Dude!

459
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:36,926
- Alright, well I guess we're back to normal now-

460
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:39,073
bro that was crazy, and right now here's how you do it!

461
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,701
To kick this off, we have to make a crazy bubble solution,

462
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,201
this is a job for: Bubble Boy!

463
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:46,292
- Wait, what?

464
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:47,450
What are your powers, bro?

465
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,990
- You haven't heard of my legendary powers,

466
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,322
check these out!

467
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:51,575
(bubbles blowing)

468
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:53,538
- Wow, you're making bubbles.

469
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,418
So amazing, wow.

470
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:57,401
- I can tell you don't think I have real powers, I find that

471
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,820
kind of offensive, so you know what?

472
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,653
Bubble Bath Blast-Off!

473
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,221
- Bubble Boy, I can see you.

474
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,054
- I blasted off.

475
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:05,608
- No, you didn't you're right here, bro.

476
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:06,942
- Bubble Bath Blast-Off #2!

477
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:08,190
Again, boom!

478
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,107
- Oh, dude!

479
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,243
- I heard that!

480
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:13,216
- The fridge?

481
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,067
You came out of the fridge?

482
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,194
- And I'm back to normal!

483
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,565
Alright, so first off we need to remove the top and

484
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:19,398
add some soap.

485
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:20,630
Alright, so I'm just going to add it in, so let's see here.

486
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,498
Look how good I am, bro, my aim is impeccable!

487
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:23,955
Then next up, add some water.

488
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:24,788
Turn it on.

489
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:25,695
More, Devan.

490
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:26,528
No!

491
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:27,736
Now, bubble solution is ready,

492
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:29,193
and now it's time for the dry ice.

493
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:31,095
We actually have to put a hole in this container,

494
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:32,066
so here's how this works.

495
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,975
I'm going to use The Finger of Fury!

496
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:36,796
- Bro, it's just you're face getting red.

497
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:37,891
Oh!

498
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:38,724
What!?

499
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,123
(screaming)

500
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:40,956
Dude!

501
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:43,956
(shouting)

502
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:46,548
- That's what you call The Finger of Fury!

503
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:48,861
- I don't need a Finger of Fury, I have a sharpie,

504
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:49,830
and I can just cut it out.

505
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,934
- Now that makes me angry!

506
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,418
(glass shatters)

507
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:55,401
Now, it's time to break up some dry ice, so here we go,

508
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:57,617
with three, two, one ooh.

509
00:12:57,617 --> 00:12:59,723
You know what, I would say a chunk about this size

510
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:00,556
should do it.

511
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:01,756
Like this, here we go, pop that in there,

512
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:04,106
okay now add some water to it here, that's it, done.

513
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:06,495
Okay, now I'm going to pop the top on here, it's working!

514
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,397
Now it's time for the bubbles, so as you can see,

515
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:09,328
look at it, just like that.

516
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:10,543
- This is so cool!

517
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:11,387
Yo, what!?

518
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:13,003
- Okay, now here we go, so now you're going to dip it into

519
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,830
the top here, in the top of your soap thingy,

520
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,238
and you're going to pull it out and see if it works.

521
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:18,306
(screaming)

522
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:19,139
- What!?

523
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:19,972
- It's getting bigger!

524
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:20,827
Three, two, one!

525
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:22,124
(screams)

526
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:22,973
What!

527
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:24,069
It keeps going!

528
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,902
- Oh, oh!

529
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:26,856
Don't move just let it-

530
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:27,689
(screams)

531
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:29,270
- [Both In Unison] Oh!

532
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,103
- Yes!

533
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:30,936
- No!

534
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:31,820
- [Both in unison] Oh!

535
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,653
- Wait a second, Devan, wait, wait.

536
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,254
- Two bubbles merge!

537
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:35,087
- Devan!

538
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,402
I want to see if I can make the biggest one possible!

539
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:37,821
Dude, it just bubbled up down there!

540
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:38,654
Alright, here we go!

541
00:13:38,654 --> 00:13:40,798
Whoa, I got it, I got it, I got it!

542
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:41,715
- What, no!

543
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:45,532
(both exclaiming)

544
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:46,365
- [Both in unison] Dude!

545
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,198
- I'm going to try to make a bubble like this,

546
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:48,689
let's let it drop, let it drop, ooh!

547
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,022
Yo, it's like sticking to the ground!

548
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:52,056
- It's like the perfect orb!

549
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:53,455
(both exclaiming)

550
00:13:53,455 --> 00:13:55,101
- Alright, that is it, you get to comment down below who

551
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:58,060
made a cooler bubble, right now, we are on to the next one!

552
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,276
- [Both in unison] Oh!

553
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:01,660
- New challenge estimate, liquid or light, and right now

554
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,520
it's time for a lightning storm with my hat!

555
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,720
Here we go, three, two, one!

556
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,808
(lightning striking)

557
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:07,139
Yo, dude that was awesome!

558
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:07,972
That was so bright!

559
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,409
- Dude, where did you go!?

560
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:10,242
- I'm right here!

561
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:12,804
- I can only see your hat and your clothes and stuff!

562
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:13,637
(screams)

563
00:14:13,637 --> 00:14:14,470
- Oh my gosh!

564
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,303
- Try holding this!

565
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:16,136
There you go!

566
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:16,969
Whoa!

567
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:18,440
It's like a floating pumpkin!

568
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,273
Yeet!

569
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:20,106
Oh, jeez!

570
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:21,527
Alright, I'm going to try to take off the hat.

571
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,360
- No!

572
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,193
- Why?

573
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:25,060
- The only way to get it off, Devan, is what's called

574
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,911
a Head Yeet.

575
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:26,744
- A what!?

576
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:27,577
- It's called a...

577
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:28,410
(lightning crashing)

578
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,168
Yes, I'm back to normal, bro, this is awesome!

579
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,017
- Yeah, you're back!

580
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:32,483
I can actually see you!

581
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,540
- Good, alright now, let's make some liquid lights!

582
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,642
To kick things off right now, oh my gosh, I guess we need

583
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,343
some highlighters around here, so fleet!

584
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:39,308
Or yeet!

585
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:41,697
Alright, we got some highlighter, so now it's time to remove

586
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:42,829
some things out of these highlighters.

587
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:43,678
- Very specific.

588
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:45,112
- [Both In Unison] Three, two, one!

589
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:45,959
(both shouting)

590
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:46,792
- Dude, it actually worked!

591
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:48,178
Oh no, pick it up, pick it up!

592
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,696
(both shouting)

593
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:51,529
- It was on the floor.

594
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,423
- Three, two, one!

595
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:54,606
You got to uncork this.

596
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,181
Alright, highlighters inside now.

597
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:57,014
Now blow on it!

598
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:57,918
- Alright. (blowing)

599
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:59,051
Oh my gosh, bro, that's crazy!

600
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:00,676
Okay, done, alright perfect!

601
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:01,972
I'll pop this right in here.

602
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:03,869
- Next step is, you take the cap, then you cut

603
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,808
a hole in it, and then you take this thing,

604
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:07,178
and put it inside the cap.

605
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:08,907
- So this first step, bro, you need to relax, so guys

606
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,749
we need three things: water bottle, empty of water, we need

607
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:12,999
a cap, and we need this little spout thing.

608
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,060
Put them all together you have a Cap Spout Water Thing.

609
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,893
- Tada!

610
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:17,421
Next step we're going to it with rubbing alcohol,

611
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,044
and this is very important, oh man,

612
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,263
I'm not good at this stuff, and this is where

613
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:22,962
it gets crazy because we're going to use these bottles

614
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,944
to pump out the florisene out of these highlighters.

615
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:25,999
- What!?

616
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:26,888
It's running down my hand!

617
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:27,721
Oh, no, no, no!

618
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:29,150
It's spilling, it's spilling!

619
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,983
It's totally spilling!

620
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:30,816
- We're having trouble with this!

621
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:31,649
(yelling)

622
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:32,482
It works!

623
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:33,421
This is crazy!

624
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:34,966
- Alright, so we've got the florisene in here

625
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,985
and the next step is to pop it in here, and we're going

626
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:38,263
to heat it up for twenty minutes, and it's going

627
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:39,676
to look crazy when it's done.

628
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:40,690
Alright, now it's time to mix them up!

629
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,523
(twinkling sound effect)

630
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,567
Yo, so the twenty minutes are up and this stuff looks crazy,

631
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,910
it's time to test out the liquid light.

632
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,297
The florisene has been reduced to powder and now we're about

633
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:51,328
to turn it into liquid light, but before we add it,

634
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:52,946
we need to consult The Genie.

635
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:53,779
- The what?

636
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,369
That's just a giant spoon, bro.

637
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:57,479
- No, this is Spoon-Genie.

638
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,312
- What?

639
00:15:58,312 --> 00:15:59,580
You just combined two words dude.

640
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,661
- This is Spoon-Genie, okay?

641
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:01,882
Now, I have to wake him up.

642
00:16:01,882 --> 00:16:02,989
- How? - Like this!

643
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:05,086
(screaming)

644
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:05,919
(arabic music plays)

645
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,484
- Who dares wake Spoon-Genie from it's slumber?

646
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,507
- We need your advice, how much powder should we add?

647
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:11,355
- Google it!

648
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:12,325
- So weird.

649
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:13,654
- Let's just put him face down right now.

650
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,553
Right now let's turn off the lights and see how this

651
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:16,642
liquid light looks.

652
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,680
Alright, I'll kick it off, here we go,

653
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,721
three, two, one!

654
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:19,554
(techno music plays)

655
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:21,257
- [Both In Unison] Whoa!

656
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:22,090
- What!?

657
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,923
Oh my gosh!

658
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:24,654
- It's like growing underwater, bro!

659
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:26,077
Dude, it looks like a jellyfish!

660
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:27,316
- Alright, my turn, here we go!

661
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:28,725
- [Both In Unison] Oh!

662
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:31,564
- It's so cute, it's like smoke billowing.

663
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:33,588
- We're going to go for the most amount yet, you ready?

664
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,036
Three, two, one!

665
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,981
- [Bot In Unison] Whoa!

666
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,198
- I feel like we're in Harry Potter right now,

667
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,030
because this is like a magic potion!

668
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,440
- No way!

669
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,408
- Whoa!

670
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:45,160
- It looks like lily pads are exploding!

671
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,812
(both exclaiming)

672
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:49,445
- I think this is one of the coolest things we've ever done!

673
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:50,373
- Dude!

674
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:51,866
That looks so cool!

675
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,736
- You get to comment down below, what's your favorite

676
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,381
color we should use to make liquid light!
