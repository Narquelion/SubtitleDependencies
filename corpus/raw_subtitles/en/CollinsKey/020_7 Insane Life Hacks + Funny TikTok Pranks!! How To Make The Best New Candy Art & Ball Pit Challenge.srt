1
00:00:00,241 --> 00:00:01,161
- I'm gone!

2
00:00:01,161 --> 00:00:02,056

So right now let's jump in!

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,383
Woo hoo!

9
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:13,477
But before we jump into the ball pit

10
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:15,019

11
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,019

how to make a whole bunch of delicious candy treats.

14

For this life hack you challenged us

15
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:22,537
to make a whole bunch of delicious edible treats

16
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:23,370
- Yep!

17
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,203
- You can easily make at home!

18
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:26,508
- I'm making a super simple D.I.Y ice cream bar.

19
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:27,853
- Alright well you as do that it's time for me

20
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:29,937
to make the delicious edible chocolate bowl

21
00:00:29,937 --> 00:00:30,781
for my ice cream.

22
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,614
- Delicious

23
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,613
- Delicious!

24
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:33,754
It's gonna be good.

25
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:34,587
Gonna take my balloon,

26
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:35,502
gonna dip it in this chocolate here.

27
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,919
Hopefully it doesn't just like pop my balloon.

28
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:37,890
(laughing)

29
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,723
It looks like a little bowl cut!

30
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:41,800
(Screaming)

31
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,127
- You got it on us, bro!

32
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:43,960
What are you talking about?!

33
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,097
- Can we just please pause for a second

34
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:47,403
to look at, he looked like a dude with a bowl cut

35
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:48,236
- It really did!

36
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:49,499
- He looked like us when we were younger!

37
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:50,332
- Yeah, yeah!

38
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:51,165
Alright, well we tried to clean up,

39
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:52,017
but it didn't really work, so.

40
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:52,850
- Exactly.

41
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,683
So I've got another balloon here,

42
00:00:53,683 --> 00:00:54,516
to try it again.

43
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:55,349
- Let's just-

44
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:56,182
(ominous music)

45
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,015
- Are you trying to pop another one dude?

46
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:57,907
- I'm just trying to check it out,

47
00:00:57,907 --> 00:00:58,740
to make sure it's good.

48
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,879
- Alright, and boom!

49
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:00,911
So now it's time to go and take this,

50
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:01,837
put it in the fridge, let it freeze.

51
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:02,808
I'm gonna do this very quickly so it doesn't

52
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:03,641
pop everywhere!

53
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:04,474
Okay bye!

54
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:05,307
(Balloon pops)

55
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:06,140
Oh dude not again!

56
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,148
- Wait did it pop again really?

57
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:08,918
- [Collins] Dude it's everywhere bro!

58
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:09,751
This is even worse!

59
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:10,981
While my D.I.Y ice cream and bowl

60
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,061
are freezing in the freezer

61
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:13,107
it's time for me to show you how to make

62
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,883
a D.I.Y waffle pizza.

63
00:01:14,883 --> 00:01:15,899
- Nice! And I'm just doing this

64
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,155
for another nine hours.

65
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:18,009
I'm just kidding.

66
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:19,025
- Your hair looks really funky Devon

67
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:19,858
- Thank you.

68
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:20,791
Let's touch your hair

69
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,682
- You don't touch my hair!

70
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,515
You know the rules!

71
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,348
You know the rules!

72
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:24,181
- Fine, fine.

73
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:25,014
- I'm gonna show you how to make

74
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:25,847
a delicious waffle pizza

75
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:26,680
when Devon stops messing around

76
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,938
and distracting me.

77
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:29,035
- What are you doing?

78
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:30,089
- I'm moving the dough.

79
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,423
- It's hard to concentrate too

80
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,006
- Yeah, I'm having trouble as well, sorry.

81
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:34,272
- So then I have some heavy whipping cream.

82
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:36,458
This'll be like the ice cream on the inside.

83
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:37,291
- All right

84
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,438
- I can't even c-

85
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:39,271
You are bored.

86
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,748
So I'm gonna put this popsicle stick in here

87
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:42,368
and then stick this thing in the freezer.

88
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,465
- Okay, so don't worry,

89
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:44,760
I'm just kneading out my dough right over here.

90
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,593
Just gonna smack this,

91
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:46,426
I'm gonna borrow your hammer

92
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:47,259
for a moment if you don't mind.

93
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,092
[Devon] What, no!

94
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:50,366
- Well yes of course, it's a family hammer Devon.

95
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:51,307
- No, you will not.

96
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:52,681
- It's a family hammer!

97
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,072
- It's like Thor's hammer to me, bro.

98
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,465
- Check this out, when I wield it

99
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:56,298
BOOM!

100
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:57,131
Look at that!

101
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:57,964
- Wait a sec

102
00:01:57,964 --> 00:01:58,797
- It gets cooler!

103
00:01:58,797 --> 00:01:59,630
- It doesn't do that for me.

104
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,250
- No, see the thing is I was chosen by Valhalla!

105
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,121
If you really think you're worthy

106
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:04,163
of wielding the hammer, Devon,

107
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:05,793
take it at your own risk.

108
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,027
- All right well I know I'm worthy so here we go...

109
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,926
- Three, two one, go for it

110
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:10,759
(electric sparks)

111
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,592
- Yes!

112
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:12,425
- No way!

113
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:13,258
- I am the worthy brother!

114
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,091
- Oh, man!

115
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:17,387
Okay so I knew it, he was not worthy.

116
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,985
- So as my ice cream stuff freezes in the freezer,

117
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:22,526
I am going to make my next burrito hack.

118
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,269
- Here I've got my squares of dough over here

119
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,116
which are gonna act as the pizza waffles.

120
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:26,949
- [Devon] Thank you,

121
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:28,461
just gonna move that off to the side there

122
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:29,981
- Oh, ya know this is actually a great idea.

123
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:31,836
I can actually take some of Devon's scrambled eggs

124
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:34,097
and use it as bit of a glaze on the top of my dough.

125
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:34,972
(record scratching)

126
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:35,805
- Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!

127
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:36,844
- You give me ingredients, bro,

128
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:37,924
I make a chef's masterpiece.

129
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,284
- I didn't give 'em to you, I just put 'em there

130
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,034
- You placed them right here, man, this is my space.

131
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:44,303
Next up, time to open up a giant can of tomatoes.

132
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:46,241
That left a dent here on the cutting board.

133
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:48,893
- [Devon] Oh, you're actually using a can opener.

134
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:51,782
- I am, Devon, I've become a civilized dude.

135
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:54,380
- [Devon] Putting my eggs on here, just like that.

136
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,006
I think I'm doing it.

137
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:56,839
- Perfect!

138
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:57,672
- All right, so this next part

139
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:58,505
- Wait hold on

140
00:02:58,505 --> 00:02:59,338
- I've gotta go a little bit quicker because

141
00:02:59,338 --> 00:03:00,171
there's a lot of tomato sauce in there

142
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:01,004
as you can clearly see.

143
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:01,837
- I don't remember what I need to put on this tortilla

144
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:02,670
- Fleet!

145
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,057
Okay Devon come on, speed is of the essence Devon

146
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:05,641
- I don't know what to do with it

147
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:06,673
- Put the tortilla on top

148
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:07,665
- I don't know, now?

149
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:08,691
- Yes, that's how it works, yes!

150
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:10,086
So here we go, just gonna take a bit of cheese

151
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:12,004
popping a bit of cheese on the top just like this.

152
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:13,570
Dude, I'm sad I don't think this is

153
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,652
a big enough piece of dough.

154
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,871
Gonna place the top down.

155
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:17,691
That's the sound of pizza!

156
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:18,574
Uh oh, uh oh!

157
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,810
(mumbling)

158
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,733
- We're gonna have an issue here bro

159
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:22,632
- So here we go, what, what?

160
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:23,465
- Looking like a boat

161
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:25,008
- Well I think we're gonna have to like -

162
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:25,903
- How is this a?

163
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:26,736
- suck up some of this juice

164
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:28,605
- Oh, oh, that's not nice.

165
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:29,791
Ugh, why is it so runny?

166
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:30,624
- It's tomato juice.

167
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:31,693
I mean, people drink.

168
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:32,945
- This is like a reverse burrito bro

169
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:34,026
- A what?

170
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:35,116
- It's like a reverse burrito

171
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:36,782
- Oh no, I heard you, I just don't understand it

172
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,115
- It's like a b-

173
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,561
[Together] Three, two, one!

174
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:41,939
- [Devon] It's like a pancake flip, yes!

175
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,002
So now, I'm gonna put in some of this ham.

176
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:44,835
- That ham looks whack.

177
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:45,668
- It's ham.

178
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:46,796
- And speaking of delicious looking stuff

179
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:47,629
Oh!!

180
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:50,050
- [Devon] I did kinda burn it

181
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,313
- [Collins] Oh that bottom is toasted.

182
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:52,146
- Yeah.

183
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:52,979
You know what?

184
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:53,812
I think our mom and dad would probably like this.

185
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:54,645
- Exactly,

186
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:56,099
- They have made several burned items for me

187
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,590
and had no issue with it.

188
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,423
(drum sting)

189
00:03:58,423 --> 00:03:59,256
- Ooh, roasted!

190
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:00,397
- -All right now it's time to finally

191
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:02,558
take the ice cream out of its wrapper here

192
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:03,651
- Ooh

193
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:07,362
- Oh, wait second it's still a little bit like, melted

194
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:08,647
[Together] Ohhhhh!

195
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:10,754
- This is gonna be so tasty!

196
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:11,587
(screams)

197
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:12,420
- Holy cow

198
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,253
- What are you doing?

199
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,086
- A piece just fell off and

200
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:14,919
- Did you just really just pop that now?

201
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,888
- I'm sorry, well I thought if I scared you enough

202
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,359
you might like slip in and like,

203
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,408
I'd take a bite of it.

204
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:19,241
- Definitely not.

205
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,074
Dipping it in the chocolate.

206
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:21,570
Now I just gotta, oh, I don't want those sprinkles.

207
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,971
I want these sprinkles.

208
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,620
They're like unicorn sprinkles

209
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,486
- [Collins] So this is the moment of truth.

210
00:04:25,486 --> 00:04:27,995
Will the homemade ice cream actually be like ice cream?

211
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:29,522
(screams)

212
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:30,355
- [Devon] Look at that!

213
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:31,219
- [Collins] I'm gonna pop this in the freezer

214
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:32,405
one last time and it's time to make

215
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,783
some edible delicious spoon.

216
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:34,720
- All right, now it's time to show you

217
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,322
how to make the actual edible dirt.

218
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:38,318
So you have to take some chocolate mushroom

219
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:39,151
- Mush-

220
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:41,065
- They have a mushroom shape.

221
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:41,898
- No they don't!

222
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:42,731
- Yes they do.

223
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:43,749
- That's a muffin!

224
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:45,668
It is time for me to very expertly

225
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:47,373
cook my marshmallow and melt it.

226
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:48,623
Oh, okay, well!

227
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:53,282
- What is happening?

228
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:54,506
- It's shedding its outer layer.

229
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:55,339
It's like a snake

230
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:56,172
- Whoa!

231
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,339
(screams)

232
00:05:00,494 --> 00:05:01,519
- All right so now for my worms,

233
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,256
I actually made some hot chocolate right here

234
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:05,876
- I got some hot chocolate over here

235
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:06,709
All right well

236
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:07,703
it's time to enjoy some delicious hot chocolate

237
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:09,858
- Wait, I actually need this Collins

238
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:10,736
- What?

239
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:11,569
But that's mine

240
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:12,909
- Nope, I know

241
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:14,017
- Give me yours

242
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:14,850
- No, no no, no

243
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,683
I actually need both

244
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:16,554
- How selfish!

245
00:05:16,554 --> 00:05:18,279
- I have to make edible worms dude

246
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,112
- [Collins] All right well here we go,

247
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:21,512
I've got some starburst on a stick.

248
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:22,345
The stick's on fire.

249
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:23,178
- [Devon] What are you doing this for?

250
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:24,011
- [Collins] It's just the stick that's on fire.

251
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:24,844
- [Devon] What are you doing this for?

252
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:25,677
- Go away stick.

253
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:26,607
Oh, that's a piece of the stick.

254
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:27,501
That's a piece of the stick!

255
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,334
- [Devon] Oh no man.

256
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:29,357
(screams)

257
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:30,190
What are you doing?

258
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,023
No, don't touch it.

259
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:31,856
- All right so next up I got a siphon here.

260
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:32,981
So I have to fill it with whipped cream

261
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,183
and this is the last part of the delicacy

262
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:36,666
- Whoa, dude!

263
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,569
- That took a little but too much energy man.

264
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:39,402
- What just happened?

265
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:40,670
- Holy cow, I got it on me.

266
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,828
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa

267
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:44,005
Try it over here with this one here.

268
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:44,838
(ominous music)

269
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:45,837
(screams)

270
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,817
- Dude, I think it got on me.

271
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:48,896
- I don't have that good of-

272
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:50,314
- It's on my hair

273
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:51,440
- [Collins] I have to fill up these straws

274
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,125
with this gelatin hot cocoa.

275
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,697
So I got the worms out of the cup.

276
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:57,164
Now I'm gonna try to extract them form the straws.

277
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:58,962
All of the DIY foods are fully done

278
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:00,468
and I've gotta say I'm blown away

279
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:01,868
by how these things turned out.

280
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:03,010
Here is the big reveal

281
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,796
- [Together] Three, two, oh wait!

282
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:05,629

291
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,148
- [Devon] Look at these masterpieces man!

292
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:24,008
- [Collins] You guys comment down below,

293
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,754
which one looks the most delicious

294
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:27,789
and we'll be eating all of them at the end of the video.

295
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:28,694
- You challenged us to make some

296
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:30,477
insane DIY shooters like this.

297
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:31,486
Check it out, here we go

298
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:33,327
- No, why at me?

299
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,414
- Well, right now let's make some blasters

300
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:37,797
So I'm starting off by making a high pressured water gun.

301
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,594
- And I'm making a soda can spy gun

302
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:40,494
- So basically the way it works

303
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:41,771
I've got a CO2 cartridge here,

304
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:43,433
I'm gonna pop it onto the back of the watergun

305
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,925
and hopefully it's gonna blast the water out.

306
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:46,791
First I gotta test to make sure that the CO2 can

307
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,692
is actually gonna make the water go everywhere.

308
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:49,853
I've got some safety gloves on,

309
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:50,918
do not try this at home.

310
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:53,130
Here we go, three, two, one.

311
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,633
There we go, it's going, it's going it's going!

312
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:56,466
There it goes

313
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:57,376
(screams)

314
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,122
It looks great underwater bro

315
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:00,738
(screams)

316
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:02,212
Holy cow, where did it-

317
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:03,652
I think that's a positive test so far, so

318
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:04,584
- You're dripping everywhere

319
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,076
- I'm sorry, it's just water

320
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:08,621
- So now I just need to cut my coca cola can in half-

321
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:09,454
What?

322
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:10,287
- Go for it

323
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:11,120
- Actually, I should probably do this outside

324
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,027
- That's probably a good idea

325
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:13,223
- Let me do that

326
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:14,597
All right, so I've got my soda can here

327
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:15,944
Just gonna place it down like this

328
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:19,180
And now I need to cut it very precisely in the middle

329
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,298
Here we go, three, two, one

330
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:23,102
(rock music)

331
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:24,382
Wow, that totally did not work

332
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:25,445
But don't tell Collins because

333
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,687
I'm actually gonna grab another can,

334
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:27,779
use some normal scissors,

335
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,284
but I want him to think I used this ax,

336
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:30,293
so don't tell him.

337
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:32,714
All right I used the ax to cut the coca cola can.

338
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:33,547
- What?

339
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:34,671
You used an ax to do that?

340
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:35,504
- [Devon] I did, yes

341
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:36,724
- [Collins] I've used an ax before to slice open

342
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,036
a coca cola can, Devon,

343
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:39,531
it did not turn out like that.

344
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:41,014
- I think you were just doing it wrong

345
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:42,536
'cause this is how I did it.

346
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:43,507
- Here hold this for one second

347
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:45,067
- Now you're asking me to help you?

348
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,419
- I need your help so here hold this for a second

349
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:47,252
- Fine, fine

350
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:49,113
- And this time, we are going to use a ballon.

351
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:50,669
You would think that if I poked the balloon

352
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,818
it's gonna pop but check it out

353
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:52,651
(ominous music)

354
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:53,484
Oh!

355
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:54,317
Okay there go look at this, boom, trick,

356
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:55,700
give me the gun, give me the gun!

357
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,034
And it looks like frozen water,

358
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:58,710
it's a frozen water trick, if you look over there

359
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,759
it doesn't look like it's moving at all, right?

360
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,899
- It does, though, a lot.

361
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,067
- Not at the front end.

362
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:02,990
Boom and just like that

363
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,948
- It's not a full pre sweet-

364
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:07,136
Wow okay, my feet are stuck

365
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:08,819
- I ran out of capacity.

366
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:09,733
The water gun is all filled up

367
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:10,733
and the last thing I gotta do

368
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,520
is attach the CO2 container over here

369
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,356
and then it's gonna be a high pressured water gun.

370
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:15,578
- Well as you do that,

371
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,548
I have made the outside of my spy gun.

372
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:19,427
But now I'm gonna make the inside.

373
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:20,549
All right the structure is built-

374
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:21,978
- Yo, check out what I found bro

375
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:22,811
- A nerf gun

376
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,842
- No it's not a norf gun, norf gun!

377
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,456
- It looks like a nerf gun

378
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:27,289
- Boom!

379
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:28,122
- So is it off brand?

380
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:30,210
- Check that out, it's a norf gun.

381
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,043
You know what Devon,

382
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:31,930
(incoherent screaming)

383
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,197
- No, what's that?

384
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:36,224
- It's a norf gun portal

385
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,831
Look at that, check it out!

386
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:38,982
Time to test it, you ready?

387
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:39,877
Three, two, one

388
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:41,504
(screams)

389
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:43,015
That is awesome but here's the real question.

390
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,878
Will it work with a water balloon?

391
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:45,711
Here we go, three, two, one

392
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:46,544
- No, no , no!

393
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:48,235
(screams)

394
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:49,068
- Bro!

395
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:49,901
- Yeah, that worked.

396
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:50,748
- Are you kidding me?

397
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:51,992
- See, Devon, the thing about portals

398
00:08:51,992 --> 00:08:52,993
is they're unpredictable.

399
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:54,355
- I am soaked

400
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:55,456
- Like, I didn't know for a fact

401
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:57,129
if that would work but I'm very happy it did.

402
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,792
- [Devon] Well I just gotta dry off a little bit

403
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,691
and finish up my spy gun here.

404
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:01,783
Just gotta make the hydraulic system

405
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:03,515
and the blaster point and then I'll be all done.

406
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:05,054
- The DIY blasters are all finished.

407
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:06,492
The question is, will they be able to

408
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,080
fire accurate shots?

409
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,264
I think they will but here is the big reveal.

410
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:11,097
- [Together] Three -

411
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:11,930
- Oh wait!

412
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,763
- Oh yeah, three second like challenge.

413
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:13,596
We want to see if you can like this video

414
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,181
in three seconds, ya ready?

415
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,014
Here we go

416
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,398
- (together) Three, two, one, done.

417
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:20,231
Three, two, one, tada!

418
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:22,826
- [Collins] Wow, look at these man!

419
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:24,349
- [Devon] Wow, we did such a good job

420
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:26,064
- [Collins] We'll be firing them at the end of the video.

421
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:27,491
You challenged us to turn our house

422
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:28,879
into an indoor amusement part with

423
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,464
thousands of ball pit balls

424
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:33,199
and a stair slide, so right now,

425
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,334
let's go!

426
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:35,659
(woos)

427
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,942
- All right let's fill this thing up.

428
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:37,775
- Coming down!

429
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,352
- Oh no, no, no, not again

430
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:40,185
- Yeet!

431
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:42,935
(balls bouncing)

432
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:46,214
- Three, two, one

433
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:47,587
- It's a good thing you got the pads there.

434
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,581
- Yeah this is very fun, I'm having a blast

435
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:51,612
(screams)

436
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:52,770
All right so at this point I think it is time

437
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,398
for us to get the slide ready.

438
00:09:54,398 --> 00:09:55,383
Listen, next thing we gotta do here,

439
00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:56,631
we're gonna be sliding down all the way here

440
00:09:56,631 --> 00:10:00,400
into ball pit, so right now let's go make the slide.

441
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,761
Or it looks like I'm making the slide by myself.

442
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,835
Sike, I ain't making no slide.

443
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:04,668
(bell dings)

444
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:05,559
We're outside, it's time to show you

445
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,763
how to make an epic stairslide.

446
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:07,700
But as you can tell we're in

447
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,814
pretty cool suits right now

448
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:09,647
(air horn)

449
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:10,480
And the reason is because we're not making

450
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,542
basic stair slides

451
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,370
we're making beautiful pieces of art.

452
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,586
To paint my part of the stair slide

453
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:16,189
I've got some water balloons over here

454
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:17,751
that I filled with a whole bunch of paint.

455
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,560
Three, two, one

456
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,393
(splat)

457
00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:21,241
(screams)

458
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:22,074
Oh snap!

459
00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:22,919
- I think I'm gonna start with a rainbow

460
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,247
so Collins can you hold this real quick?

461
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:25,433
- Sure I will hold your mop for you, okay.

462
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:26,862
With one finger only.

463
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:28,162
- [Devon] The first color I'm gonna grab

464
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:28,995
is gonna be red here.

465
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:29,828
- Okay.

466
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,422
- Now I'm just gonna do a nice pour

467
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,008
like that, there perfect

468
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:33,954
- How long do I have to hold this for

469
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:35,079
because I'm getting bored

470
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:35,999
- Just a little bit longer, Collins,

471
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:36,913
just a little bit longer

472
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:37,746
- This is a long time

473
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:38,788
- [Devon] And, we're done.

474
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:41,629
So now I'm gonna take this and I'm going to swirl it

475
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:43,219
- [Collins] I don't understand it, like you know me,

476
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,172
I'm all about that instant gratification, man,

477
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,445
if it's not happening right now

478
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,278
(splat)

479
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:48,111
I'm not happy

480
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:49,490
Oh dude, oh no we got it on the camera.

481
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,979
- Just look, hold on, look at mine

482
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:51,834
- I can't, I can't

483
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:52,755
- Dude you're missing it

484
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:53,588
- I got it on the camera, what?

485
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:55,158
- What?

486
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:56,712
- Are you kidding?

487
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:58,328
- Time for circle number two.

488
00:10:58,328 --> 00:11:00,012
- Yup wait, you're doing how many of these?

489
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:01,676
- I'm doing six

490
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:02,509
(laughs)

491
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:03,464
- I'm over here popping balloons, man

492
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,661
and you're just taking forever.

493
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:06,043
- Mine's more relaxing, you know,

494
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:07,689
yours is very energetic.

495
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:09,304
(rock music)

496
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:10,808
- Oh my god, my exposed ankle.

497
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:13,516
The only part of me that was fully exposed!

498
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:14,349
- All right, now fan it out.

499
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:16,435
Now I have to grab some colors and tada!

500
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:18,343
Look at that.

501
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:19,176
(splat)

502
00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:20,709
(screams)

503
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:21,580
(laughing)

504
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,413
- You all right?

505
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:23,591
- You even thought of that

506
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:24,811
- See with the little pranked

507
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:25,644
(air horn)

508
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,477
- It's pay back time bro

509
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,310
- No, no, no, wait, wait wait

510
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,143
- Yes!

511
00:11:28,143 --> 00:11:29,135
- Fine, pay back time but let me put my hood on

512
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:32,385
- All right here we go, three, two, one

513
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,250
(screams)

514
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,333
- I got it up my nose on that one

515
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,527
- I feel bad now

516
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:38,500
- Thank you

517
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,684
- Yes, I just don't feel comfortable with that-

518
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:42,143
- How bout this, we high five it

519
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:43,014
- No

520
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:43,847
- We high five and then truce

521
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:44,787
- [Together] Three, two, one

522
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,769
(splat)

523
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:47,958
(laughs)

524
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,204
- [Collins] That was such a stupid idea,

525
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:50,037
what was I thinking?

526
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:52,562
- I don't know, that's what I said.

527
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,779
All right so just gotta fan out the mop here

528
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,632
- Oh, I forgot I have a slingshot.

529
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,373
See I've got cool stuff I haven't even used yet.

530
00:11:58,373 --> 00:11:59,379
I don't know how a slingshot works.

531
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:00,212
Oh there we go, oh boom,

532
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:02,096
there we go, boom, figuring it out on the fly.

533
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,929
Three, two, one, yeah!

534
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,868
- Dude you okay?

535
00:12:08,868 --> 00:12:10,461
- That hurt, that hurt bad.

536
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:12,857
- Oh my god, I'm honestly glad

537
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,114
you don't know how to use a slingshot.

538
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,019
That was hilarious.

539
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,624
(laughs)

540
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:17,636
- I need to walk that one off

541
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,751
(laughs)

542
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:20,584
Now I'm gonna have to, like,

543
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:21,804
just finish this one out like this.

544
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:23,293
- [Devon] All right I just have to do a couple more of these

545
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:24,335
and our slides will be done

546
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:25,168
and then it's time to fill it up

547
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:27,034
with ball pit balls.

548
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:28,085
- Finishing up my art, there we go,

549
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:29,162
just a little penguin slide

550
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:30,222
- Are you kidding, it looks so good, dude

551
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:31,446
- Yeah it looks even better now!

552
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,088
- Does it?

553
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:34,545
- Now it's just time to put the finishing touches on

554
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,378
and let 'em dry

555
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,109
- And then it's time to fill it up with ball pit balls

556
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:38,030
(dings)

557
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,612
- It's the final stretch; time to fill up the rest

558
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:41,472
of the ball pit balls, install the slide,

559
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:42,876
and we'll be ready to have some fun.

560
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:46,043
(upbeat techno music)

561
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,955
- [Collins] We got the slide, now it's time to

562
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:56,609
attach it to the staircase that way we can

563
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,722
slide down into this glorious ballpit.

564
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:00,121
- Take that

565
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:00,954
- All right, here we go.

566
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:01,787
- You're the one who's taking it

567
00:13:01,787 --> 00:13:02,642
- All right here we go, boom!

568
00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:03,988
- We didn't even get it in place and you said boom.

569
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:05,422
(mumbles)

570
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:07,555
- Mission Impossible like shimmy down the side over here.

571
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,888
Watch out for the paintings.

572
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,349
All right cool, so next thing we've gotta do

573
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:13,854
is just take this thing and place it now,

574
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:15,183
probably reinforce it little bit

575
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:16,016
- Yup'

576
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:16,849
- And it'll be good to go

577
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:17,692
(screams)

578
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:18,525
- Devon?

579
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:19,358
We lost him.

580
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:20,191
Where are you?

581
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:21,161
All right so now it's time to taste

582
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:23,532
all of our delicious, homemade DIY foods.

583
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:25,198
And again, you can easily make these

584
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:27,303
at home as well, with just a few simple ingredients.

585
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:28,924
The first one we're gonna start off with

586
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:30,823
is our homemade ice cream bars over here.

587
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,679
- Oh, I can not wait.

588
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,507
- It's actually, like, surprisingly heavy.

589
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:35,340
- It is

590
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,173
- I didn't expect it to be so heavy

591
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:37,006
- It's got value.

592
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:38,200
- Exactly, I couldn't agree more.

593
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,033
All right here we go

594
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:41,366
- [Together] Three, two, one

595
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,904
- These are like frozen

596
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:44,869
- Holy cow

597
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:45,851
- Mmm, bro

598
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:46,803
- I'm having trouble

599
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:47,961
- Cut through the bottom, do the bottom.

600
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:48,961
- Wow, whoa!

601
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:51,105
- Your face is like--

602
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:52,818
it's the teeth, they're red and blue.

603
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:53,755
(laughs)

604
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:54,588
I got it

605
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:55,795
- This right here is really good.

606
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,889
I gotta say, 10 out of 10, recommended.

607
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,092
Next up we got this little marshmallow

608
00:13:59,092 --> 00:13:59,925
- This one

609
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,167
- [Collins] No, no the marshmallow cups first, we're-

610
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,000
- [Devon] Okay yeah

611
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,954
- We're gonna start off with a little sweeter side

612
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:04,349
before we got to my savory waffle pizza

613
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:06,395
- Or the burnt side, maybe?

614
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:07,228
- [Collins] Yeah these are definitely a little burnt

615
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:08,435
so how bout this, wanna take this one here?

616
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:09,760
- You touched it, so

617
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,944
- So yeah, respect that

618
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,180
- I don't know how this could go wrong

619
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,625
- I think there's a lot of ways this could go wrong

620
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,458
- Cheers

621
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,912
- Yup, cheers, it might have the taste of flames

622
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:16,768
So here we go

623
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:19,101
- [Together] Three, two, one

624
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:22,438
- That's a game changer.

625
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:24,633
- That is really good, it's so fruity

626
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:26,931
and it mixed with the whipped cream

627
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:30,367
- Hit with the marshmallow, ellow, ellow,

628
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:31,642
(claps)

629
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:32,475
Wow!

630
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:34,382
Next up, how bout this, we'll eat two at the same time

631
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:35,215
- That's a good idea

632
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:36,351
- How bout we eat you foamed and frothed coffee

633
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:38,203
as well as this pot of dirt?

634
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:39,076
- I'll take this one

635
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:39,929
- Yeah I'll take the pot of dirt.

636
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:41,088
I'll go first, I'll take a bite of mine

637
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:41,921
then we go for yours.

638
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:44,337
So take this, do a little scoop in here like that.

639
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,650
Oh boy, that's some wormy dirt.

640
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,184
Here you go, ya ready, three, two, one

641
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:50,959
- How is it?

642
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,792
Ew okay, that was a little weird.

643
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:52,996
I really do want to try one of these worms.

644
00:14:52,996 --> 00:14:54,987
- That's so good man, that is so good!

645
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:56,089
- Yeah, that's really good

646
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:57,573
- These two so far have been the clear winners

647
00:14:57,573 --> 00:14:59,371
but this looks like it could have a pretty strong chance

648
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:00,204
- So I'm gonna try this

649
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:01,069
- Are you gonna drink some of it?

650
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:01,902
- Yes

651
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,590
- Or take a bite and try to drink at the same time

652
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,423
- I'm gonna do both.

653
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:05,256
You ready for this?

654
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:06,089
Here we go

655
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,422
- [Together] Three, two, one

656
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:10,307
- [Collins] You good?

657
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:11,501
You had like a small spasm.

658
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:12,926
- The milk just came rushing in,

659
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:13,759
so that's why

660
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,592
- A flood

661
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:15,816
- Yeah exactly so I'm gonna try the jello cup now

662
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:17,727
- Okay yup take a bite

663
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,582
Ugh it's all over your face!

664
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:21,556
That's more than a mustache, it's like connected

665
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:23,073
from your nose to your mustache

666
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:23,906
(groans)

667
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:25,306
- It's not the greatest but it's pretty good

668
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:26,921
- You got it still on your nose.

669
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:28,204
How bout this, can I take a bite out of the side

670
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:29,037
since you didn't?

671
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:29,870
- Go for it?

672
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,703
- If you wouldn't mind holding this,

673
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:32,147
now this is to make sure when I bite into it,

674
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:33,481
the milk goes everywhere, it doesn't

675
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:35,290
go all over our delicious uneatened food.

676
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,373
All right here we go, three, two, one

677
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:40,425
(screams)

678
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:41,803
- Nice, how is it?

679
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:42,636
- Milky!

680
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:44,428
- Yeah it really just tastes like milk, doesn't it?

681
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:46,037
- The milk and coffee.

682
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:48,382
All right next up it is time for the delicious waffle pizza.

683
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,351
- [Devon] Or the totally burnt waffle pizza

684
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:51,349
- I probably shouldn't prejudge it

685
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:52,331
with saying it's delicious because we

686
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:54,028
don't actually know if it's gonna be delicious

687
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:54,861
or not at this point

688
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:55,783
- Yeah you want to set the expectations

689
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:57,173
very low for this one

690
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,651
- [Collins] So I think we'll slice it in half like this,

691
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:00,093
we'll kinda each take half of the pie,

692
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,259
in this case half of the square.

693
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:02,092
- Cheers

694
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:02,925
- Cheers my dude

695
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:03,758
All right here we go, three

696
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:05,175
- Two, oh what?

697
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:06,008
- Seven

698
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:06,841
- One hundred

699
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:07,674
- All right here we go,

700
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:10,132
- [Together] Three, two, one,

701
00:16:10,132 --> 00:16:11,952
- [Devon] Very different from the coffee one

702
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:12,785
- Huh

703
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:13,618
- You know what, it's pretty good

704
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:14,451
- I feel like

705
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:15,284
- What do you feel?

706
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:16,993
- I feel like I want to talk without being interrupted.

707
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:18,590
It's just kind of mediocre across the board

708
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,272
- That's not true, it's a little soggy too

709
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:21,752
- So far, this is the first fail one we've had.

710
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:23,107
Hopefully the next one is still better

711
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,166
- [Devon] So how bout this, so I think we should

712
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,155
go for the omelet burrito first and then

713
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:26,790
take the skittles popcorn next.

714
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,623
Do you want to grab a half?

715
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:28,513
Just grab it

716
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:30,654
- Like a wishbone?

717
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:32,557
Tada, oh wow there's ham on the inside?

718
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:33,390
- Yes there is!

719
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,223
- All right ready

720
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:36,571
- [Together] Three, two, one

721
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:37,404
- Mm, I like that.

722
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:38,304
It's different than all the sweet stuff

723
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:39,273
but it is good.

724
00:16:39,273 --> 00:16:40,389
- Yeah, it's not as bad as I thought.

725
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:41,717
It's definitely not a zero

726
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:42,661
(drum sting)

727
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:43,796
- You know if I was going for a burrito,

728
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,583
I'd probably have that as one of my options.

729
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,416
- Really?

730
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,249
- Yeah

731
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:48,082
- I don't think so

732
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:49,124
All right now it's time for the skittles popcorn!

733
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,240
And I am very excited about this popcorn man

734
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,394
- Yes, go for it.

735
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:53,227
- So I'm just gonna take a big chunk

736
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:54,060
over here like this, ooh!

737
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,259
Look at that!

738
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:56,122
- This looks fantastic!

739
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:57,777
- This looks so good, literally you need

740
00:16:57,777 --> 00:16:58,962
is corn and skittles, and you

741
00:16:58,962 --> 00:16:59,795
can make skittles popcorn.

742
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:01,233
- Yeah, all right, wait corn?

743
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,414
You need kernels

744
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:05,831
- [Together] Here we go, three, two, one!

745
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,260
- Oh yeah!

746
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:11,299
- That's good, the crunch actually

747
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,466
(mumbles)

748
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:16,604
- It's kicking in and it's not nice.

749
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:17,657
Who would've thought man?

750
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:18,544
- I thought it was gonna be great

751
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:19,808
- It's got a whack aftertaste

752
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:20,641
- It really does

753
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:21,474
- It's got a whaftertaste

754
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,247
It's time for us to eat our final food.

755
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:26,193
This delicious ice bowl--again I can't say it's delicious

756
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:27,026
- Wait a second, wait a second

757
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:27,859
- What?

758
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,564
- This actually deteriorated, I mean, look at this

759
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:30,737
It got sad and soggy

760
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:32,111
- [Collins] It's homemade ice cream, Devon.

761
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,172
It's been sitting out so we can eat the rest of it

762
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:36,286
So again, these are edible spoons so how cool is that?

763
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:37,830
You get edible ice cream, with edible spoons,

764
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,312
and an edible bowl, wow!

765
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:40,643
It's just so

766
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,174
- [Together] Many edible things!

767
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:43,968
- [Collins] I'm just gonna take a scoop

768
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:44,801
- Yeah

769
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:46,676
- Scoop da doop.

770
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:47,749
We're gonna take a bite of the ice cream,

771
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:49,469
a bite of the spoon, and then last but not least,

772
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,430
gonna sink my teeth into that nice bowl.

773
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,263
Ready here we go

774
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:55,115
- [Together] Three, two one!

775
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,865
- Mm, it's so fruity!

776
00:17:58,165 --> 00:17:59,174
(clap)

777
00:17:59,174 --> 00:18:00,353
- This one gets better, wow!

778
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:01,186
- Whoa!

779
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:04,219
- Holy c-the bowl's broken.

780
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:06,695
Did you get, brain freeze I'm assuming.

781
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:08,552
Oh and as an extra bonus, I actually made

782
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:09,795
an edible baby Yoda head,

783
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:11,096
so let's see how it tastes.

784
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:12,650
- [Collins] No, you can't eat baby Yoda!

785
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,483
- What, why?

786
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:14,675
- [Collins] Because it's baby Yoda!

787
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:16,494
- Okay fine, we'll just look at him then.

788
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:17,327
(bells ding)

789
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:18,365
- It is time to test out our DIY blasters.

790
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,155
We've got a whole bunch of targets set up over here.

791
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:22,562
Each one is gonna be worth a different amount of points.

792
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:24,082
But it's all gonna come out in accuracy.

793
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:25,903
All right now it's time and this thing is super charged.

794
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:26,736
Here we go

795
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:28,091
(water spraying)

796
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:28,924
Oh dude!

797
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:31,546
(pop, screams)

798
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:33,128
- [Devon] Did you blow off the -

799
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:35,393
- I think I blew off the water gun.

800
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:37,593
- [Devon] That scared me so bad

801
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:38,593
- How do you think I felt?

802
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:39,817
I was holding it.

803
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:40,937
I don't know if that's a bust or

804
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:41,967
if that's win, to be honest.

805
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,187
- It's a bust, literally.

806
00:18:43,187 --> 00:18:44,532
- Yes, technically.

807
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:45,729
- [Devon] I think you did a good job with this,

808
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,179
I think it's probably a seven though,

809
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:48,796
'cause you didn't pop any of those,

810
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,494
wasn't super accurate, so yeah.

811
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:51,327
- I didn't quite pop it, man

812
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,001
Alright so for the red hot pencil shooters.

813
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:53,990
Gonna pick that up first

814
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,823
- [Devon] I got it

815
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:55,998
- [Together] Three, two, one

816
00:18:55,998 --> 00:18:59,262
(pop screams)

817
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:00,602
- [Collins] All right so this here, this is the final one.

818
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:01,816
This is what it all comes down to.

819
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:04,378
Now it's time to raise it up.

820
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:05,211
(Screams)

821
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,566
- [Together] All right, three, two, one.

822
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:09,399
- Devon is it going?

823
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,232
- I'm trying.

824
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,332
- It's so close

825
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:12,647
(screams)

826
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:13,480
- You got it!

827
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,752
You made contact!

828
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:15,669
You hit it!

829
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,671
You know what, I'm not walking away from this

830
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:18,614
without popping something, here we go

831
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:19,744
(ding).

832
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:21,095
There you go, that's what should've happened.

833
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,678
(upbeat music)

834
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,855
All right, so they're both kind of a fail on that one.

835
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:30,148
Right now we're on to the next one.

836
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:31,943
All the ball pit balls are set up

837
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:34,000
and now it's finally time to ride down the slide,

838
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,550
jump in, and go crazy,

839
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,055
so let's do it bro!

840
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:38,616
- All right let's do it, oh wait, whoa!

841
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:39,449
- What are you doing man?

842
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:40,998
So here is the moment we have all been waiting for.

843
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:44,135
Time to ride the slide into the ballpit.

844
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:44,968
- Why do you get to go first?

845
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:45,801
- 'cause I'm the older brother.

846
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:46,634
- All right, fine.

847
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,322
- I'm so nervous man, I'm so nervous

848
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:49,155
- You gotta go

849
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,153
- [Together] Three, two, one

850
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:50,986
- Go for it!

851
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:53,009
(screams)

852
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:54,563
- That did not go according to plan.

853
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:55,450
I think I need to put my socks

854
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,610
back on when I get up there.

855
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,552
- [Together] Three, two, one

856
00:19:57,552 --> 00:19:59,324
(screams)

857
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,768
- Yo that's awesome!

858
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,478
- Dude, I gotta try this, here we go

859
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:04,131
- [Together] Three, two, one

860
00:20:04,131 --> 00:20:05,781
(screams)

861
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:08,070
- You're surfing man!

862
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,940
- [Together] Three, two, one

863
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,778
(screams)

864
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:12,165
- Dude, you got covered!

865
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:13,038
- That's so crazy man!

866
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:14,583
- Wait, let's try sliding together.

867
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,416
- That's-

868
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,249
- Yeah, let's try it.

869
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,857
- We're both going down together at the same time

870
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,044
- All right let's do it, here we go

871
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:19,877
- Pinky promise?

872
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:20,710
- Pinky promise

873
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,373
- Brinky promise, gotta hands on the brinky promise

874
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:23,922
- [Together] Three, two, one

875
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:24,755
- What?

876
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:25,588
(laughs)

877
00:20:25,588 --> 00:20:26,758
Are you kidding me bro?

878
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,770
In preparation for the swan dive into the ball pit,

879
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,105
there's something else I've always wanted to try,

880
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:30,938
and that is

881
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,971
[Together] Boogie boards!

882
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:36,469
- I am surprised that it is so buoyant.

883
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,651
(screams)

884
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:38,779
- Dude, that was nuts!

885
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,088
I'm going surfing on the U.S.A., baby!

886
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:43,743
- [Together] Three, two, one

887
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,017
(laughs)

888
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:45,943
- You feel like you're in the ocean man,

889
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:47,349
just paddling away.

890
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:48,663
Well, I just sunk in the ocean.

891
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,560
This would be a shark, a shark would eat me right now.

892
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,384
- [Together] Three, two, one

893
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,224
- Woo!

894
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:54,331
(screams)

895
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:55,347
- Are you all right?

896
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:57,538
- I hit my heels on the hard cement

897
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:58,800
- Oh man!

898
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,194
It is finally time to summon the duck

899
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:02,870
(screams)

900
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,066
We're gonna have 15 seconds.

901
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,316
At the end of the 15 seconds whoever's left on the duck,

902
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:07,674
they win king of the ballpit

903
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:10,287
(screams!)

904
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:12,410
- Take your feet over there

905
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,243
- Yes!

906
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:14,076
- This is not your moment, Devon!

907
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:14,909
- Yes it is!

908
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:16,717
(screams)

909
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:17,550
- Yes!

910
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:20,729
No!

911
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:21,866
I got it, I'm on it!

912
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,614
- Is it whoever has the most time on the duck?

913
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:24,447
- Oh man!

914
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:25,280
(sighs)

915
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,113
- I think I'm just gonna lounge here,

916
00:21:26,113 --> 00:21:27,133
as the king of the ball pit,

917
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:27,966
you know what I mean?

918
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:28,799
- I feel like the king's servant,

919
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,191
you know it's like fanning him off after long day at work.

920
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:31,269
- Yes, all right next up dude

921
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:32,553
let's do the hamster wheel, right?

922
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:33,491
- I think we gotta get this duck out of here,

923
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:34,324
so we here we go

924
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:35,752
(groans)

925
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,981
Shouldn't ruin the house, that way

926
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:38,814
- No this way

927
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:39,647
- All right Devon, get over here,

928
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm gonna need you to give me a push

929
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,950
to start it to go

930
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,783
- All right I'm down, I'm down.

931
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:44,909
- [Together] Three, two, one

932
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:45,966
(screams)

933
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:46,799
- [Devon] Did that work?

934
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,632
- [Collins] Dude not really

935
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:48,465
but that was actually very fun!

936
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:49,315
You know what Devon?

937
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:50,148
- [Devon] What?

938
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:50,981
- I'm just gonna hang out here, man.

939
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:52,844
It's a very nice, relaxing area to just chill, ya know?

940
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,266
(Screams)

941
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:55,160
You literally landed on my arm, bro.

942
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,355
- Oh, I did?

943
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:57,814
- Yes, okay now

944
00:21:57,814 --> 00:21:58,997
- I'm getting buried

945
00:21:58,997 --> 00:21:59,830
- Why are we both getting buried?

946
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,663
(ominous music)

947
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:01,843
No!

948
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:02,689
I'm gone.

949
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:03,551
- [Devon] Me too.

950
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:04,589
- [Collins] You're on my leg.

951
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,015
I've got another brilliant idea Devon.

952
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:08,538
Here, take a side and put the yeet blanket on ya.

953
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:09,371
It's so soft

954
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,204
- Dude!

955
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,139
- This is the yeet blanket so we're gonna yeet these balls.

956
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:14,249
- Oh yeah, here we go, you ready?

957
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,423
- [Together] Three, two, one

958
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:19,590
(upbeat techno music)

959
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:21,883
(screams)

960
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,069
- That was so awesome.

961
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:24,558
All right the slide has been taken down,

962
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,491
and it is now time for the big jump.

963
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:29,333
I'm gonna swim my way over to you.

964
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,725
- You first!

965
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,850
Okay, get up, get up.

966
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,683
- Here we go!

967
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:34,296
So the thing is, where should I jump from, man?

968
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:35,682
It's a lot higher than you'd expect,

969
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:37,534
especially up here, you're like yo

970
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:39,489
- There's only one place to jump

971
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:40,322
- You think it's here?

972
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:41,155
- And that's from the top

973
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:42,175
- Oh yeah!

974
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:43,273
Do not try this at home,

975
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:44,350
we are working with professionals,

976
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,538
we have professional grade crash pads down here,

977
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:48,680
so again, do not try this at home

978
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,513
- Do not!

979
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:50,539
- All right, so I think I'm just gonna have to kinda

980
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:51,670
just go for it.

981
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,412
I got my friend duck here for encouragement.

982
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:54,245
Alright here we go.

983
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:55,773
- [Together] Three, two,--wait!

984
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:57,873
If you want to win a 15 minute video call with Devon and I,

985
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:00,653
text the word CRAFT to 81800 right now.

986
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:03,548
So pause the video and text the word CRAFT to 81800.

987
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,098
You'll automatically get into it.

988
00:23:05,098 --> 00:23:06,344
Now let's see how this jump goes.

989
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,685
So right now, let's jump in!

990
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:08,518
Woo hoo!

991
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:11,003
Holy cow!

992
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:12,328
That was amazing!

993
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:14,606
(screams)

994
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:15,619
That was fun!

995
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:17,702
(laughs)

996
00:23:22,188 --> 00:23:23,372
- All right I'm gonna try to go

997
00:23:23,372 --> 00:23:25,172
on the outside of the banister here.

998
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:26,198
- Oh snap!

999
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,031
- And jump in

1000
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:30,195
- and again, do not try this at home!

1001
00:23:30,195 --> 00:23:32,644
- This definitely looks a lot higher from up here dude!

1002
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,477
All right here we go

1003
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:35,671
- [Together] Three, two, one!

1004
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:38,826
(whoops & screams)

1005
00:23:38,826 --> 00:23:40,062
- I've gotta give that one a shot

1006
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:41,978
- The hang time was insane.

1007
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:43,210
It looks a lot higher, right?

1008
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,623
- Yeah, it definitely feels way different man.

1009
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:47,050
- [Together] Three, two, one!

1010
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,465
(laughs and whoops)

1011
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:51,298
- Dude, good job!

1012
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:52,131
- Thank you man

1013
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:52,964
- That was great

1014
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:53,903
- Tricks and everything

1015
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:55,402
- I feel like we could do this all day.

1016
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:56,448
- Oh my god, yeah.

1017
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:57,281
I think we will actually.

1018
00:23:57,281 --> 00:23:58,144
Well there you have it, there are a whole

1019
00:23:58,144 --> 00:23:59,456
bunch of life hacks that you can do

1020
00:23:59,456 --> 00:24:00,289
when you're stuck at home.

1021
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:01,254
And comment down below if you were able

1022
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:02,814
to fill one room in your house with

1023
00:24:02,814 --> 00:24:03,802
a whole bunch of ball pit balls,

1024
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:04,761
which room would it be?

1025
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,594
If you want to see another video clip,

1026
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:06,845
right over here, you've got five seconds.

1027
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:07,678
Here we go

1028
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:12,063
- [Together] Five, four, three, two, one, done!

1029
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:13,008
Love you, bye!
