00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,763
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:10,709
- So basically if we could cut this, be quiet!

3
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:13,158
- You need to do some magic on that bowling!

4
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:13,991
Oh!

00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:16,890

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,753
And welcome to another tour diaries.

7
00:00:18,753 --> 00:00:20,018
And one of my favorite parts about

8
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:21,121
being on the Neon Lights tour

9
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,711
is being able to hang out with Demi.

10
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:24,035
So basically, we had a day off,

11
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:25,190
so she took all of us bowling, went

12
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,850
to our own private bowling alley.

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,115
Knocked down some pins, let's check it out!

14
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,698
(upbeat music)

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,993
(pop music)

16
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,947

18
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:52,546

22
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:00,794
