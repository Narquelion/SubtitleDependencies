1
00:00:00,248 --> 00:00:03,367
- (groans in disgust) It's weird, no!

2
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:04,847
(laughing)

3
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:06,014
(screams)

4
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:07,109
What's up, it's Collins Key

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,734
and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

6
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:11,002
Now for today's video I need my little brother, Devan,

7
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:13,076
to join me, but right now I think I heard him in the kitchen

8
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:14,852
so I'm gonna try to make him teleport here.

9
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:16,382
So let's see how this goes.

10
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:19,612
Hey! (laughing)

11
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:21,955
I think the milk came out of your nose or something, right?

12
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,124
All right guys, well this is my little bro,

13
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:27,550
my younger brother. (laughing)

14
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,359
You guys might not know this already but

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,802
as I made him appear and teleport here, I'm crying.

16
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:36,420
He requested not to be called my little brother.

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,897
He wanted to be called my younger.

18
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:42,215
So I'm calling my younger brother, Devan.

19
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:44,465
(laughing)

20
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:48,870
He hates the cereal, too. (laughs)

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,275
It's our second time filming the intro.

22
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:54,856
And he hates the cereal so much. (laughs)

23
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:56,926
So for today's video, (laughs)

24
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:58,949
- [Narrator] A few moments later.

25
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,145
- Now that we've collected ourselves,

26
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:01,574
for today's video we are going to

27
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:03,024
be testing female products.

28
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:04,280
Now Devan and I, we are guys,

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,725
we do not know about female products.

30
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:08,191
So a friend of ours, her name is Lindsay,

31
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,894
she went out to the store, got a whole bunch of

32
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:11,925
crazy female products.

33
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:14,199
Do people say that, crazy female products.

34
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,559
So today we're gonna be trying to figure out what they are

35
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:18,053
and then actually testing them on ourselves.

36
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:19,617
If you want me to do another video with Devan

37
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:21,580
where we test out a whole bunch of crazy products,

38
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,287
let us know by liking this video.

39
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:25,500
And if this video gets enough thumbs up then Devan and I

40
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,938
will make another video where we test out crazy products

41
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:28,863
just like this.

42
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:31,549
One more thing, I'm doing a ton of fan calls this Sunday,

43
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,778
so if you guys want me to call you, FaceTime you,

44
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:35,173
talk with you, all you have to do is just

45
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:36,824
download the link in the description.

46
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:38,382
It's a link for a live streaming app,

47
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:39,701
'cause I'm partnering with Live.me.

48
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,655
I'm gonna be calling as many of you guys as I possibly can.

49
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:43,950
The app is free and if you download it right now

50
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,849
you'll have an even better chance of me calling you.

51
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:46,876
And I also wanted to let you guys know

52
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:47,773
I'm doing a huge giveaway.

53
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,222
I'm giving away a MacBook this month.

54
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:50,469
So if you guys want to win that let me know

55
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:51,956

57
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:55,960

58
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,721
And, of course, you must be subscribed to this channel.

59
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:58,554
- Subscribe.

60
00:01:58,554 --> 00:01:59,387
(laughing)

61
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:00,943
- Without any further ado, whaddaya say Devan,

62
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:03,568
right now (laughs) your mouth is just totally full.

63
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:05,591
We are gonna be jumping right into the video,

64
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:06,609
so let's do it.

65
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:07,646
Devan, what do you have to say?

66
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:08,905
(mumbles)

67
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:10,551
All right, first product here we go.

68
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:12,631
- What are those?

69
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:13,695
- It looks just like fun.

70
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:14,842
Is it like a grip strength thing?

71
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:16,058
'Cause this thing is so weak.

72
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:17,038
Okay, so now we're reading the box

73
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:18,235
'cause we can not figure out what this thing is.

74
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:20,011
Let's see, what?

75
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:21,809
It's a facial hair remover!

76
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,337
- Oh no.

77
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:25,381
- Oh my gosh, this thing is horrifying!

78
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,739
- The heck?

79
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,898
It hurts, holy cow.

80
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,521
I was not expecting that level of grip all at once.

81
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:32,624
(laughing)

82
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:34,513
I just lost all my manhood, that sucked.

83
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:35,809
We don't like this. - No.

84
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,803
- This is a major ow, my chin is still in pain.

85
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:39,464
People use this?

86
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:41,154
- Why are you asking me, I don't know!

87
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:43,021
- People use this!

88
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:44,040
- [Both] For your pores?

89
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,563
- Deep cleansing pore strips.

90
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:46,478
So what's the point of this?

91
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:48,057
I guess it just cleans your pores.

92
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:49,079
We are cleaning our pores.

93
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,986
Do they do anything?

94
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:50,999
- Oh, so clean.

95
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:51,914
(laughing)

96
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:52,980
- Ow, I hit my knee.

97
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,730
Adhesive bra, how does this work?

98
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,043
Okay.

99
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:01,679
(laughing)

100
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,914
Lost one!

101
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:04,914
What is an adhesive bra?

102
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,169
It's weird!

103
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:08,169
It's weird!

104
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:10,922
It feels weird!

105
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:12,421
(groans in disgust)

106
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:14,018
Wait. Oh.

107
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:16,016
- How do you puff these up so much?

108
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:17,578
- It's called working out, Devan, okay?

109
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:19,281
Let me feel yours. - Is that the answer?

110
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,871
- Yours is rather deflated, mine's nice.

111
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:22,604
Mine's nice and firm.

112
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:23,978
Don't touch me like that, it feels weird!

113
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:26,322
- Now time to peel it off. - Okay let me see.

114
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:27,452
- Ow.

115
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:28,785
- Let me see it.

116
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:31,786
Here we go.

117
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:35,944
Now it's time to peel 'em off.

118
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:37,691
So we got one right there.

119
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,524
- Ow!

120
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,961
- All right, so these things were just ridic.

121
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:45,711
Let's help you put on your head.

122
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:48,524
Dude, you just hit my mirror!

123
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:49,479
Hold on, I gotta show you guys this.

124
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,730
I'm gonna take a selfie with my Snapchat right now.

125
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,051
If you guys haven't added me on Snapchat yet

126
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:52,988
you might as well go do that right now.

127
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:53,945
But are you ready for this, Devan?

128
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:55,319
So we're gonna leave that one up there for right now,

129
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,487
let me see if I can stick this one to the wall.

130
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,070
Are you ready? - No!

131
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,028
- Why is it so colorful?

132
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:02,720
- There's a bit of tape so I'm gonna open it.

133
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
- All right.

134
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:05,869
It's like a diaper?

135
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:09,304
- Oh. Got it. Yeah. - These are pads, right?

136
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:10,137
I think?

137
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,111
This absorbs 10 times its weight.

138
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:12,944
Wow.

139
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:14,675
That's an impressive statistic right there.

140
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,345
- I don't think I'm gonna try this one on, though.

141
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:18,617
- Do you want to use it as an arm band?

142
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:19,450
- What?

143
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,715
- Yo, I'm not saying this is a new fashion trend

144
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:22,677
or anything but...

145
00:04:22,677 --> 00:04:23,878
Absorbs 10 times its weight.

146
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:25,667
- You should put it in your armpit.

147
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,251
So it absorbs all your armpit sweat.

148
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,817
- Yeah, who needs deodorant when

149
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,154
you've got one of these things?

150
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:32,403
- Okay.

151
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:33,653
- What is this?

152
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:36,484
Well.

153
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,784
- Whoa.

154
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:38,963
That looks interesting.

155
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:40,115
- Yes, to say the least.

156
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:41,283
- Really interesting.

157
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,616
- Yeah. It does.

158
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:45,059
Any guesses?

159
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:46,855
- It says Bed Head Rock 'n' Roller.

160
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:48,998
Does this mean if you get funky bed head?

161
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,089
- Funky bed head.

162
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,599
- You just roll it out?

163
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:52,664
I think you need to plug it in.

164
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:55,071
- All right, so this thing, apparently, is a hair product.

165
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:57,373
(funky techno music)

166
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:58,206
- Like that.

167
00:04:58,206 --> 00:05:00,123
- Yup. And then spiral.

168
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,421
- Yay. It worked.

169
00:05:03,421 --> 00:05:05,395
Super blender. - Oh!

170
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:06,646
- So it probably has to do with makeup.

171
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:07,479
- Makeup.

172
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:08,432
It's like a stress reliever ball, too.

173
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:09,265
- Yeah.

174
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,570
- You can squeeze it if you get mad.

175
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,153
What if you eat it?

176
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,022
- Why would you eat that?

177
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:17,272
- I don't know!

178
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:20,108
(hacking and laughter)

179
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,012
Right as you did that the boob just fell too.

180
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:23,017
- [Both] Oh!

181
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:24,170
- All right, we can do these.

182
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,003
These are-- - Let's do it!

183
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:27,861
- These are nail gel fantasy. - Gels.

184
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,905
- Dude, look it, that does not fit my thumb.

185
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:30,972
- Bro, we can make it work.

186
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:33,066
- Devan's going to apply to my thumb first.

187
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,310
Don't do too much, it will never come off!

188
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,892
No, that's so much!

189
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:37,277
- I think I did this the wrong way.

190
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:39,137
Wait, it doesn't stick.

191
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:39,986
- It doesn't?

192
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:40,849
- Oh, wait. Hold up.

193
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:41,842
- Is it sticking?

194
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,087
- [Both] Hey! - It sticks.

195
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:43,942
- It kinda works!

196
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:44,775
It's so weird.

197
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:47,351
All right, now it's time to take it off.

198
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,655
Dude! It's stuck to my finger!

199
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:51,208
- No! Well, actually.

200
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,922
- Ow! No, it's actually, how do you get this off?

201
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:55,732
- Don't take off your whole thumb.

202
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:56,899
Oh, gosh, bro.

203
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:00,270
- It took off part of my thumbnail!

204
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,431
This is horrible!

205
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:03,198
I think I know what this is.

206
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:04,488
No, I don't actually.

207
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,249
It's almost like a firecracker.

208
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:07,189
- Pow!

209
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:08,022
- Does it work?

210
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,721
- No. Shoot.

211
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:12,416
Is it a roll of tissue, no, why did that just?

212
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,462
It's like a little torpedo missile.

213
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:15,462
It's like...

214
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:20,403
I'm gonna try to, I guess, shave my hands.

215
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:21,827
I'm so sketched out by this thing.

216
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:23,983
(bellows)

217
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:24,983
It's weird!

218
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,126
I just cut myself.

219
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:29,997
All right, your turn, go for it.

220
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:31,161
- I don't know if I wanna try it anymore.

221
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:33,795
Oh god, I can see your little hairs.

222
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:37,070
(high pitched whimpering) - That noise though.

223
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,903
Did you cut yourself?

224
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:39,005
- I thought I did.

225
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:41,817
- I think that Devan and I are not feeling this one.

226
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,778
- We're not fans of anything that involves cutting,

227
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,837
taking out hairs--

228
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,079
- Just hair removal in general.

229
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,139
- No. No. Is not our favorite process

230
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,491
of this entire thing so.

231
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,511
This thing gets a big thumbs down.

232
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,676
- Yeah, big one, a big thumbs down.

233
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:54,095
- That's a hair thing, that's easy.

234
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,614
- What the heck? - What kinda plug is that?

235
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:56,447
Try it.

236
00:06:58,075 --> 00:06:59,020
- Nope, doesn't fit.

237
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,937
- Maybe it's a garder.

238
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:03,241
- We smart!

239
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,042
- It's being plugged in, I want it to spin.

240
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:06,875
- I know.

241
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,218
- It looks like it would spin, does it spin?

242
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:09,519
- I want it to spin like a little carnival toy.

243
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,427
- Yeah, so do I.

244
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:11,368
- Oh, I can feel--

245
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:12,526
- Yeah, I can feel it heated up.

246
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:14,097
- It's warmer, yeah, it's definitely warmer.

247
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:15,335
I want this to rotate.

248
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,168
- I know. This is seriously

249
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,339
disappointing. - I have an idea.

250
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,216
Now it's rotating!

251
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:20,627
Ooh, it's getting hot, it's getting real hot.

252
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:21,747
- Oh, wow, it's very hot.

253
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:22,593
- Yeah, I told you.

254
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:24,265
That's actually really straightening your hair a lot.

255
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:26,152
- Oh! I don't want my hair straight.

256
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:28,402
(laughing)

257
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:30,184
Okay.

258
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,611
- Your hair looks amazing, Devan, it worked.

259
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:32,444
- Thank you.

260
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:33,711
- Well, I would give that one a--

261
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,149
- Do you wanna try it?

262
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,006
- No!

263
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:36,839
What is this? - Whoa!

264
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,085
Baby Skin Instant Cheek Flush?

265
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:40,918
- Huh.

266
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,776
No, I'll apply it to you

267
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:43,000
and then you apply it to me at the same time.

268
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,587
Here we go. - All right.

269
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:47,243
- No, too much, too much.

270
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:48,160
Other side.

271
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:50,518
These are just eyelashes.

272
00:07:50,518 --> 00:07:53,546
Devan, you about to look fantastic.

273
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:54,757
- I don't like it.

274
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:56,835
No, no, it's a little bit in my eye.

275
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:59,068
(laughs)

276
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:00,192
- Oh my gosh.

277
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,495
Oh my gosh. - I don't like it.

278
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,175
No, I don't like this.

279
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:06,265
I don't like it.

280
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:08,845
I don't like it at all.

281
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:09,804
- Look at me.

282
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:11,222
- I don't like it.

283
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:12,055
- Now it's your turn to do it to me.

284
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:12,888
- Yes, revenge.

285
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:14,727
- Don't hurt me, I hate it, I hate it.

286
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,363
Ow, ow, ow.

287
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,196
It hurt.

288
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,112
- Oh my gosh.

289
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:21,627
You look hilarious.

290
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,930
No, no, no. - You got it wrong?

291
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,732
- I did it wrong. What'd you do?

292
00:08:24,732 --> 00:08:26,800
- It's lopsided. - No!

293
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,177
Here we go, the final product.

294
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:31,579
Oh, you're kidding me, a face mask.

295
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,700
Bruh.

296
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,533
- Really?

297
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:34,926
- Yeah, let's do it.

298
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,714
No, no, okay.

299
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:38,422
- It kinda feels nice.

300
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:39,783
- Yeah, a little bit. What the heck.

301
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:40,931
This is actually kind of fun.

302
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,780
- You done, I don't like it, no!

303
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,794
Give this video a thumbs up if you want Devan and I to

304
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:46,578
do another video where we test out products and also--

305
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:47,768
- It's starting to burn.

306
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:48,644
- Oh I know, it's burning.

307
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:49,698
- It's starting to burn!

308
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:50,555
- Mine's not burning yet, but yeah.

309
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:52,136
- Also comment down below.

310
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:53,937
Which of these products do you use?

311
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:55,882
Go follow Devan on all of his social media stuff.

312
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,752
- Yeah, follow me but this stuff burns.

313
00:08:57,752 --> 00:09:01,016
- Whoo, it's burning, oh my gosh.

314
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:03,612
All right, end it quick, I'll make you go back to--

315
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:04,634
- All right, make me go back.

316
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:05,733
Love you guys so much. - Make me go back.

317
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:06,651
- See you guys on Sunday. - It's in my eyes!

318
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:07,713
- Download the Live.me app. - It's in my eyes!

319
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,322
- It's in your eyes? - It's in my eyes!

320
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:10,155
- All right, bye!

321
00:09:10,155 --> 00:09:11,604
There he goes and it's burning on my eye!

322
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:12,561
- Can you do my bra for me?
