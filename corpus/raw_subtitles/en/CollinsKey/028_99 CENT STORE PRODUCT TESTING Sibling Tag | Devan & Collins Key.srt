1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:00,986
(toy horn)

2
00:00:00,986 --> 00:00:02,289
(laughs)

3
00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:03,329
Well, what's up guys?

4
00:00:03,329 --> 00:00:04,537
It's Collins Key,

5
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,010
and welcome to the Thursday Vlog.

6
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,881
It's gonna be a very different video today,

7
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:08,714
as you can tell,

8
00:00:08,714 --> 00:00:09,547
and to start things off,

9
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:11,399
I need someone very special to help me out.

10
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:14,337
So, everyone, please welcome to the, uh, adjacent chair,

11
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:15,425
Devan Keys.

12
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:16,432
Ay!

13
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:17,265
- What's up?

14
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:18,569
- So, yeah. Welcome to the video, and today--

15
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:20,281
- I thought he was going for a little handshake, but nope.

16
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,114
(toy horn)

17
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:21,947
- A hand--

18
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:22,780
- Nope.

19
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,613
- Left him hangin'.

20
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:24,929
There we go, and then hit him with a (toy horn)

21
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:25,762
For today's video,

22
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:27,248
it's going to be, like I said, a little bit different.

23
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:28,091
I was actually inspired

24
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:30,879
by some other Youtubers to go to the 99-cent store,

25
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:31,816
which I've never done before,

26
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:34,015
get a whole bunch of random products there.

27
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:35,008
And now, basically,

28
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm just going to test them out

29
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,160
and see whether or not they work

30
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,280
or do what they're supposed to do

31
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,543
because they're from the 99-cent store,

32
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,543
so I don't know if that changes the quality of 'em at all.

33
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:42,376
(toy horn)

34
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,209
And also,

35
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,042
make sure you guys watch til the very end

36
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:44,875
because at the very end,

37
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:45,880
I'm going to post some bloopers and outtakes

38
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,713
from this video.

39
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,546
So, make sure you guys give this video

40
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:48,472
a big thumbs up

41
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:49,328
if you're excited to see

42
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:50,584
what random things we've gotten.

43
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,520
And, yeah.

44
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,353
Let's jump into the video.

45
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:53,479
So, we're going to be starting off with a bang,

46
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,312
and we're going to be--

47
00:00:54,312 --> 00:00:56,520
the party poppers with confetti.

48
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,353
- I didn't know you'd be going that fast.

49
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:58,186
(laughs)

50
00:00:58,186 --> 00:00:59,019
- Let's see if this is a--

51
00:00:59,019 --> 00:00:59,852
Oh!

52
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:00,685
Well, it opens very easily.

53
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,616
I gotta say that.

54
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:04,223
There's this gun round cartridge,

55
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:05,328
and then the party popper.

56
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:06,161
Dude, wait, wait, wait.

57
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:06,994
I don't even know what we're doing.

58
00:01:06,994 --> 00:01:07,827
Hey, whoa, whoa.

59
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:08,660
We have to be like, coordinated.

60
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,493
- Do you know what you're doing?

61
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:10,326
- I'm moving faster than you.

62
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:11,159
- Dude, you don't even know what you're doing.

63
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,992
- Oww!

64
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,081
That actually hurt, dude! Oww!

65
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,150
- There's no face shots.

66
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:17,983
But a nut shot.

67
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:18,990
- Oww!

68
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,950
(laugh)

69
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,134
You are a savage.

70
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:23,967
- No face!

71
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:26,680
You shot at my face!

72
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,848
(laugh)

73
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:29,592
- Oh well! My bad!

74
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:30,425
- Dangerous!

75
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:31,258
- Do it again! Do it again!

76
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,655
(laugh)

77
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:34,488
Alright,

78
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:35,321
well the verdict on

79
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,127
this first party popper gun with confetti.

80
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:37,960
- They're awesome.

81
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,793
- This was amazing.

82
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:39,923
- If you go to shoot each other in the face.

83
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,563
- Now, the next item is a golf club,

84
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:42,685
and these are very plastic.

85
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,557
They look pretty cheap and they feel pretty cheap.

86
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:45,653
Like, you can just like-- (yelling)

87
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:47,813
And just like break it.

88
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:49,581
But we're gonna go outside and test them out for sure.

89
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:50,414
- You're not gonna win.

90
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:51,247
(laughs)

91
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:52,165
- Yeah, let's go do it.

92
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:53,469
Teeing up for the shot.

93
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:54,302
He's placing his golf ball

94
00:01:54,302 --> 00:01:55,837
on the proper position for him to be able to

95
00:01:55,837 --> 00:01:58,509
hit the golf ball at a relatively high speed.

96
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:01,648
There is a, umm, 400 mile an hour wind

97
00:02:01,648 --> 00:02:03,399
coming at us in this direction.

98
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,365
- Gotta shake my booty.

99
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:06,198
No!

100
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:07,925
(laugh)

101
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:09,592
- You missed so bad.

102
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,650
(laugh)

103
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:14,407
- Oh, gosh.

104
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:16,813
I gotta get myself out of the way.

105
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:18,069
- Yeah!

106
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:20,069
- You totally--you suck!

107
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:26,744
Hole in one!

108
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:27,607
I win!

109
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:28,759
- These are a fail.

110
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,250
- Yeah, I gotta say these are kind of a fail.

111
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,271
Umm, and look at these.

112
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:33,391
They like, they break so--

113
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:35,334
It's like a nun chuck that's like-- (screeches)

114
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:36,167
So, yeah.

115
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,000
These are are definitely a fail, guys.

116
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,055
Next, we have very masculine glow sticks.

117
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:40,888
What are you doing?

118
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:42,223
So, umm, yeah.

119
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:44,967
Let's see if these work, or if these completely fail.

120
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:47,095
- Oh, it smells so bad.

121
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:47,928
- Yup!

122
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:49,255
This is definitely not chemical or toxic.

123
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:51,696
And now, to finish it all off.

124
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:52,529
Ta-da!

125
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:55,168
- Sword fight!

126
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:57,943
- Whoa, dude! Chill! I am zee winner!

127
00:02:57,943 --> 00:02:59,119
I gotta say I'm a little bit disappointed

128
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:01,176
that this part here doesn't actually glow.

129
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:02,287
I thought this was gonna be like

130
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:03,271
a glowy thing in and of itself.

131
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:06,615
Overall, the verdict is a fail.

132
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:08,090
(play fighting)

133
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,242
This is actually a really pointy tip. I probably--

134
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:10,327
- Stop!

135
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:11,160
- So, this next one

136
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,783
is one of the only items Devan picked out,

137
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:14,727
and you'll know why for a reason.

138
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,607
I don't-- what is--

139
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:17,295
Would you explain to them why you got that?

140
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:18,671
- He told me to pick a brand.

141
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:19,760
(laugh)

142
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,711
- Like, what is this?

143
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:22,623
- Apparently, it's to hold clothes.

144
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:23,591
- I guess, let's go for it.

145
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,999
So, we were going to try this product out inside on drywall

146
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,223
which is what it is intended for,

147
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:28,967
but we wanted to go above and beyond for this video,

148
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,199
so we've got this, umm, this wood over here.

149
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,351
It's a nice, solid wood.

150
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:33,184
We're gonna try it out.

151
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:34,487
These are like razors almost.

152
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:35,320
So, let's see.

153
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,951
I'm gonna just try to put this in the wall real quick.

154
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:37,784
It doesn't penetrate the wood

155
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,000
as easily as I thought it would, but, umm, there we go.

156
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,215
It's kinda-- It's kinda in there.

157
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,591
Actually, we don't have a hammer with us right now,

158
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:43,655
so Devan--

159
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,415
- Found a rock in the house.

160
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:46,263
- Take it away.

161
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:48,433
(hammering)

162
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,468
- So, now we have this thing,

163
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:51,687
which I think we just stick that there.

164
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:52,520
- Oh, perfect.

165
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,408
- Perfect!

166
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:54,888
Exactly how it was intended to be used.

167
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:57,088
Let's give it a shot.

168
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:58,168
Hey!

169
00:03:58,168 --> 00:03:59,012
- It works!

170
00:03:59,012 --> 00:03:59,845
- It actually worked!

171
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:00,678
Holy cow!

172
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:01,511
Alright, cool.

173
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:02,344
So, yea.

174
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:03,342
I give this a, umm, a 10 out of 5.

175
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,181
This is a 10 out of 5 right here.

176
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,014
'Cause look at this.

177
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:06,847
You can-- Oh!

178
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,437
Next item is called the power ball gun!

179
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:10,270
Ooh!

180
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,381
And it comes with targets and everything,

181
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,276
but we all know what I'm gonna use as target practice.

182
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:15,109
- Not my face!

183
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,190
- I think how it works is you pull it back like this--

184
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,023
- Lame.

185
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:21,757
That was lame.

186
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:22,590
- This is--

187
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,940
Okay, so this product is right off the bat,

188
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,523
this is-- 'cause if you don't put your hand here,

189
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:26,356
it just falls right out,

190
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:29,075
so this product is a massive fail.

191
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:29,908
- And next up,

192
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:31,699
we have hand drums.

193
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:32,532
Yay!

194
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:33,753
Man, I'm gettin' purple!

195
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:34,586
- First of all,

196
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,696
I gotta say that this is not really a hand drum,

197
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:38,496
'cause there is--look at this compared to my hand.

198
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:39,960
Like, this fits in my hand.

199
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,240
- Mad beats!

200
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,073
(laughs)

201
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:42,906
- Mad flow!

202
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:45,073
- You look so funny with--

203
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:48,039
They're not a win,

204
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:48,957
but they're not a fail.

205
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,931
And the only other product that Devan bought is--

206
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:51,764
- No. No.

207
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:52,597
- Yes.

208
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:53,603
- This is actually something that he bought,

209
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:55,739
and just really wanted to try it out.

210
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:56,699
(laughs)

211
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:57,532
- No way, dude!

212
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:59,372
Regardless of whose idea it was,

213
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:00,570
which it was his, let's get into it.

214
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,803
- It was actually his.

215
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:02,636
- Let's do it.

216
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,469
- Whatever.

217
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,302
- It's basically like a picture

218
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:05,135
with just a whole bunch of numbers on it,

219
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:07,318
and there's like different--I feel like a magician.

220
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:08,151
So, we were gonna do this

221
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:09,790
until we found out that sparkles are involved.

222
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,886
- Get that outta here!

223
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:11,719
(grunting)

224
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,358
- We are not a fan of sparkles!

225
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:14,550
This was a massive fail.

226
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,616
We are not a fan of this

227
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,924
because it included sparkles.

228
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:19,020
Big, big fail.

229
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,172
So, onto the next one.

230
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:23,422
I forgot, Devan did get one more thing.

231
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:25,463
He comes up to me, he's like,

232
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:26,296
"I don't know what this is."

233
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:28,472
It's a toilet freshener.

234
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:30,263
(laughs)

235
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,623
He literally brought me a toilet freshener.

236
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,591
(sniffing)

237
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,424
And it smells

238
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:35,575
like one of those disgusting porta-potties.

239
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:36,408
Look--smell it.

240
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:37,241
- No!

241
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,398
- It's totally disgusting. Yes.

242
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:39,231
- That's so gross.

243
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:40,064
- You were the one who bought it.

244
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:41,014
Okay? Smell it.

245
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:41,847
Smell it.

246
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:43,860
(gasping and coughing)

247
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,693
This is a massive fail.

248
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:46,247
I don't know why you would want your toilet

249
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:47,964
to smell like another toilet.

250
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:49,519
So, this is a massive fail.

251
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,685
Now, for this next one, we're gonna be makin' some noise!

252
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,125
We're testing out, umm, the trumpet

253
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,308
and a whole bunch of flutes.

254
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:56,430
(toy trumpet)

255
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,015
You sounded like a dying duck just now.

256
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:01,101
(toy trumpet)

257
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,184
(laughs)

258
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:05,958
Go for it.

259
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,422
- I can't, man. I'm laughing too hard.

260
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:08,422
(toy trumpet)

261
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:09,286
- There you go!

262
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,119
- Ay!

263
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,662
- What were you doing? You were like (toy trumpet)

264
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,486
(laughs)

265
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:14,734
(toy trumpet)

266
00:06:14,734 --> 00:06:15,567
- I was not!

267
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:18,086
(toy trumpet)

268
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,166
(toy whistle)

269
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,718
- It's like really late right now,

270
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:24,326
and people are trying to sleep.

271
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:25,942
(toy whistle)

272
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:27,023
(laughs)

273
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:28,174
And these are definitely a win.

274
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:29,878
(toy trumpet)

275
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:31,222
- That's not as bad as the whistle.

276
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:32,456
- Yeah, so--

277
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:33,550
(toy whistle)

278
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,526
(laugh)

279
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,062
- He's just not good at blowin' things.

280
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,734
So, for me, the verdict is, these are a huge win.

281
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:39,567
These are a massive win.

282
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:40,406
- No.

283
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:41,239
(toy trumpet)

284
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,072
Fail.

285
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:42,905
(laugh)

286
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:43,738
So, next up are something called "wall walkers,"

287
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:44,734
which are basically little blue men that are--

288
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:46,534
look how disturbing these things are.

289
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:47,694
Look at this!

290
00:06:47,694 --> 00:06:50,478
Like, you could literally pull them apart, and-- oww!

291
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:51,703
- Ay!

292
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,536
- Whoa!

293
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:53,369
- Hey!

294
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:55,639
- They're all-- see, yeah.

295
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,472
They are walking.

296
00:06:56,472 --> 00:06:57,305
That's really cool.

297
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:58,138
Okay.

298
00:06:58,138 --> 00:06:58,971
Look at this one right over here.

299
00:06:58,971 --> 00:06:59,804
Whoa!

300
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:00,637
Oh!

301
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:01,470
Ah, man.

302
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,303
He died.

303
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:03,136
Oh, no, he's alive!

304
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:03,969
Okay, these are actually a massive win.

305
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:04,802
- No look.

306
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:05,635
- Yeah, that was nice.

307
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:06,468
- Did it work?

308
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,301
- Yup.

309
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,134
- Whoo!

310
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:10,349
- Now, this final item is the most expensive item.

311
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,682
It is actually a dollar, 29.

312
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,965
They are rockets, so let's open 'em up.

313
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:16,901
I think these are gonna be, like,

314
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:18,702
too explosive to do inside,

315
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:22,053
so we are gonna go outside and try 'em out right now.

316
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:23,832
But, umm-- (squeaking)

317
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:24,807
I like the sound of it so far.

318
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:26,113
So, yeah. Let's go try em out!

319
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,196
(laughs)

320
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:30,134
Oh, man!

321
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:34,319
This is the rocket test. Ready, aim, fire!

322
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,397
Ah! Dude!

323
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:37,480
- Oh. Are you good to go?

324
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:39,538
(Bleep)

325
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:40,371
- And now,

326
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:43,140
to settle this once and for all, the quick draw.

327
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,473
Two steps, ready, and begin!

328
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:47,957
The final verdict

329
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:50,212
on the most expensive item in this video

330
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:51,340
is that they were a win.

331
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,173
We had fun with these.

332
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:53,124
Don't point that at my face.

333
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,124
Please stop.

334
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:56,492
Ah!

335
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:57,413
- That's right.

336
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:58,246
- No!

337
00:07:58,246 --> 00:07:59,079
Not again!

338
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,607
What are you doing, you crazy man?

339
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:01,608
Ah, no, what are you doing?

340
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:02,441
Okay, yes.

341
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,879
So, umm, if you guys enjoyed this video,

342
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,287
please give it a thumbs up right now.

343
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,543
Dude, this stuff is so nasty and, like, so toxic.

344
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:10,423
And also, share with your friends

345
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,239

randomly testing out products and items video.

And also, comment down below what other random items

349

you guys want me to use in, umm, in upcoming videos.

350
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,099
Dude, stop!

351
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:26,932
You're getting my computer.

352
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:28,817
Dude, my computer!

353
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:29,650
And also,

354
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,769
make sure you guys check out all of Devan's links.

355
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,642
His links are all down in the description below.

356
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:33,921
So, be sure to go follow him

357
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,173
on all of his platforms,

358
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:40,012
and the Keeper of the Week is Becky, aka Living Musically.

359
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:40,845
I love you so much, Becky.

360
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:42,043
You are always super active

361
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,755
and you are such a hardcore keeper.

362
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:44,731
So, shout out to you, fam.

363
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:45,564
We love you so much,

364
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:46,875
and if you want to be the Keeper of the Week,

365
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,318
and be featured in one of my videos,

366
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:49,259
all you have to do:

367
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,532
just be super active on Twitter,

368
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:52,747
on Instagram, on Snapchat, on Youtube,

369
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:53,739
liking, sharing, commenting.

370
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:54,819
Basically, the more active you are,

371
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:55,867

378
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:07,560
Yay! We held them in our hands. That was a terrible idea.

379
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,393
- Oh, man!

380
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:09,226

387
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:16,528
- Not the face, not the face!

388
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:17,361
- Okay.

389
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:19,712
We're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done.

390
00:09:19,712 --> 00:09:20,545
Ay!

391
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:21,378
Chill!

Geez!

396
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,293
You're scarin' me! (bleep)

397
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:34,261
Here is the aftermath. Look at all this.
