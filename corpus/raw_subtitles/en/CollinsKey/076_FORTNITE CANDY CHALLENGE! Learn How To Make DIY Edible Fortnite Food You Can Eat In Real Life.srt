1
00:00:00,903 --> 00:00:02,190
- [Collins] Dude, it's a candy llama!

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,960
- [Both] Three, two, one.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,952
- Chug jug! (water splashes)

4
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:07,579
Oh my God!

5
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:08,570
- Oh, I think I'm gonna take this from you!

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,030
- Well you challenged us to do DIY

7
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,970
edible Fortnite item, it's in my eye!

8
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,766
Oh my God, right now, let's go!

9
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:15,890
For this one we are making a Boogie Ball so right, ah

10
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,215
Oh, I dropped mine!

11
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:20,010
- I want the top of this, one, two, three.

12
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,500
Boom! There we go, chop the top, woo!

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,841
- Can you do that to mine?

14
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:24,674
- Here we go, three, two, one, bam!

15
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:25,770
(sound of sharpening knife)

16
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,109
- Nice!

17
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,990
- Oh, snap! Alright, well, let me get that back.

18
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,640
- Hold out your hand like this

19
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,570
- Like this? - Here we go

20
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,403
- Okay

21
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:33,284
- Boom! Perfect I got it, okay.

22
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,482
- You can have this one over here.

23
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:35,480
- No! Are you kidding?

24
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,508
- No - What?

25
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:37,341
- It's another joke, Devan.

26
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:40,410
- You got mad puns but I got quick hands, bro!

27
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,420
- Check this out, boom!

28
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,011
There we go Devan, from now,

29
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:44,314
- What? No!

30
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:45,147
- Alright, so now we have to kind of skewer

31
00:00:45,147 --> 00:00:47,410
these little treats here into the pineapple.

32
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,730
I got a little bit of a different idea

33
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,816
and different strategy here, Devan.

34
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:52,948
Oh, no, dude's got a tongue!

35
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:54,690
It's like a little tongue, it's like bloop bloop bloop.

36
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,690
Yo, I gotta say, my Boogie Ball is coming along very nicely.

37
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,550
And there we go, boom, now my initial part of it is done.

38
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,877
So here we go, now we got the top.

39
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:05,076
- [Devan] Bro - No, no, no.

40
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:08,123
Prop it up, no no. Prop it up like, there we go.

41
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:11,190
I think I won this round.

42
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,857
I mean look at it, it needs a little help to stand up,

43
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:16,680
but like it's mid-boogie ball detonation, it's like bwah!

44
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,810
And it's about to, ooo, dance dance, I can't dance.

45
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,510
- Alright, next up we add the handle and we add it on the

46
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,600
(snapping sound)

47
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,880
I thought that would be way easier.

48
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,640
I thought it was just gonna slide in, and done!

49
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,190
- Instead of waiting til the end of the video

50
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,653
we're going to eat these right now.

51
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:31,050
This is literally a full avocado with candy,

52
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,674
you got a piece of pineapple on it.

53
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:33,507
- Yeah, it's gonna be weird. - It's gonna be pretty weird.

54
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:35,983
Wait wait wait, first, five second subscribe challenge.

55
00:01:37,044 --> 00:01:37,877
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

56
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:41,220

57

Are you ready?

58
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:46,520
Five, four, three, two, one.

59
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,027
Done, if you can do that comment down below

60
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:49,970
"keep it squad" right now and let's see

61
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,170
how this funky thing tastes.

62
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,410
I'm gonna pick mine up here, ooo, oh I lost it.

63
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,583
Alright so I guess I'm just going to take a bite of it?

64
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,363
- Have you ever had an avocado with the skin on it?

65
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:04,089
- [Both] Three, two, one, go!

66
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:05,422
- Toothpick, ow!

67
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:09,490
Ow, ow, this tastes nasty!

68
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,793
You gotta eat that dude!

69
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,968
I'm even eating the candy and it tastes gross.

70
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,531
- And now, wooo! (glass breaking)

71
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:18,770
We are making the most important tool in a fortnight,

72
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,680
and that is a harvesting tool.

73
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,110
I'm making the pink flamingo.

74
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,910
- And I'm making the rainbow smash.

75
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,170
- Get it, ohh, no we got pretzel sticks.

76
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,727
- No, really?

77
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:29,560
- Yo we got lots of pretzel sticks.

78
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,296
- First the banana. (laughter)

79
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:34,670
- And now there's just salt everywhere, mmm pretzel sticks.

80
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,370
Gotta peel my bananer, yeah.

81
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,750
- Poor banana.

82
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,530
- So first stop I gotta choose my pretzel.

83
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,995
I've chosen this one, alright are we just gonna

84
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:45,190
kinda finagle it in, uh oh, my pretzel broke my banana.

85
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,700
And then I got some Twinkies.

86
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,600
I feel like I'm going to be running into an issue of

87
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,810
how to keep the flamingo head atop a pretzel.

88
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,410
So instead of trying to balance them all on top of my stick

89
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,480
I've actually got a better idea.

90
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,659
I'm going to make my flamingo head here and then

91
00:02:58,659 --> 00:02:59,492
- Bro, this smells really good.

92
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:01,670
- Boom, beak number uno and beak number dos.

93
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,940
Look at that flamingo!

94
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,660
Eye ball number one, number two

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,233
Yo my flamingos are looking,

96
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,725
- That's actually looking pretty good.

97
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:11,966
- Uh huh.

98
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,520
Now we got Snowballs.

99
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,340
Alright, this part, oh no, no no, bro though,

100
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,370
it feels like a sponge.

101
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,680
- Oh, whoa, that was not expected.

102
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,610
- It doesn't cut, it's just a literal sponge.

103
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,452
I'm gonna give my little flamingos hats.

104
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:26,285
- What?

105
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:27,360
- My flamingos, super stylish.

106
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,690
If I don't win this round I will be very disappointed.

107
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,665
My guy's got a little mouth.

108
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:32,510
- They look like little mustaches, bro.

109
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,950
- Well maybe they are little mustaches.

110
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,810
Dude yours looks crazy, you guys, here's the big reveal.

111
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,910
You ready, three, two, one, tada!

112
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,960
Yo, I must say it was very difficult to actually

113
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,700
put these things on a stick for the actual harvesting ax,

114
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,660
but you get to comment down below, who won this round?

115
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,660
Is it my flamingo, with a hat.

116
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,480
- Or is it my unicorn bro with rainbows on it.

117
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,140
- All I'm gonna say is it literally took like

118
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,861
an hour and a half for him to do this.

119
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:56,694
- It took a long time.

120
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,540
- That was fun, I think I almost just broke this.

121
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,520
We're gonna show you how to make a

122
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,390
chug jug right now, this legendary item.

123
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,460
Two rings, super quick, let's go!

124
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,075
- Almost hit me in the face.

125
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:06,375
- That could have been very bad.

126
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,850
(random mouth noises echoing in jars)

127
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,860
Alright, so first step, you gotta

128
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,360
flip the chug jug upside down.

129
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:12,547
This is a competition Devan, who can

130
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:13,840
make the better chug jug, fastest?

131
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,120
- So first, I guess we're going with one down, nope,

132
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,113
- One, two, three!

133
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,693
- Every time I look over at yours it's like

134
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:24,650
I don't even know what's going on, bro.

135
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,070
Bro, bro, - Eeeeeeeeeeoh!

136
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,193
Bro, what are you doing?

137
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:30,160
- Only issue now, top of the chug jug

138
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,483
has got some duct tape, gotta fix that.

139
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,010
You're gonna tear it, like that.

140
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,566
Now the fun part, now we have to add some liquids.

141
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,630
So first, you're gonna pop some Mt. Dew in there.

142
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,003
This is the chug jug, so,

143
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:44,330
Oh my god this filled up and this got frothy.

144
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,940
That is not a normal color at all, it looks tainted.

145
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,875
Alright here we go, now we're gonna

146
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,162
add some blue, and hopefully that fixes it.

147
00:04:50,162 --> 00:04:51,163
- Whoa, that looks pretty cool.

148
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:51,996
- It just turned green.

149
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:52,829
Alright so now I guess we're gonna try

150
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:54,060
to add two bottles together at the same time.

151
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,590
This is the blue stuff, woohoo!

152
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,348
Oh, that's kind of cool mid air.

153
00:04:57,348 --> 00:04:59,560
(basketball buzzer)

154
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Alright, and then finally to finish it off we got

155
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,450
a giant thing of Sprite here, ahh!

156
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,857
- Dude, that's so splashing bro, oh no!

157
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,070
Yo, it's getting frothy again.

158
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,270
Alright, I've created a new challenge called

159
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:15,583
- Where's the pug coming from, bro?

160
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:18,970
- Perfect, there we go, so we're

161
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,357
gonna get this up here like,

162
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:21,357
- Like what?

163
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,170
- Bottle cap vision!

164
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,383
Okay, now that I, aww.

165
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:30,216
This is seriously a thing.

166
00:05:30,216 --> 00:05:31,230
- That's like no vision.

167
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,110
- Alright, done with that first bit, now it's all blue.

168
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,370
Yo, wait a sec, I just realized

169
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,553
this was called "cumcumber soda".

170
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:38,470
- No! What?

171
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,923
- What? Let's see how it tastes.

172
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,820
- Real good?

173
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,584
Mine's lookin' really good dude.

174
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:44,417
No! No! Noooo!

175
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,400
Ugh, now it doesn't smell as good.

176
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,490
- It's got a funny tang to it.

177
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,160
- Just for that I am the one who

178
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,450
gets to dump these on your head.

179
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,780
- No, no no, you already dumped one on my head.

180
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,440
- It's not true. - Bam! There we go.

181
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,610
I miss him now.

182
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,240
See, I have the power, alright.

183
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,073
Ow!

184
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:01,237
That wasn't nice.

185
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,332
I gotta get him with the clapback.

186
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:03,270
(claps)

187
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,714
Ow!

188
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm not a fan of this like Devan ghost, okay?

189
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,830
Here we go. (yells)

190
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,276
First of all, this is ridiculous.

191
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:11,013
(claps) Oh, what?

192
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:11,846
- Dude. - Dude, okay ow.

193
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:12,679
- Really? - Like you're sitting, ow.

194
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,040
- Why would you make me disappear.

195
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,490
- Right now guys, this is the chug jug

196
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,620
Okay, that's enough, we're on to the next round.

197
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,240
- [Both] Crispy fight!

198
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,707
- Oh my gosh, are you okay?

199
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:24,706
- No.

200
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:25,620
- So guys, we're making a spike trap

201
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,690
and Devan got spike trapped in the face, bloop!

202
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,873
Alright.

203
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:30,193
- The first step is to open the rice krispie.

204
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,670
- This one's super easy.

205
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,940
Take the rock candy and then ow, ow.

206
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,980
I don't know what just happened

207
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,430
but I got blue all over my hand.

208
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,390
- [Devan] They're just drooping.

209
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,380
- This is supposed to be a trap

210
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,280
not to get me to get the other people.

211
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:47,450
- My fingers are turning blue, I'm turning into a smurf.

212
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm going to sauce it up with some yellows

213
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,960
because you know this is, oh, no, I broke it.

214
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,290
- Bro, why are you going blue and rainbow colors

215
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,620
that's not the color of a trap.

216
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,870
- I'm different, yeah, I'm different.

217
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,500
The issue is when you try to break it too

218
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,840
you break off the rock candy.

219
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,180
Oh, gotta watch out for this trap spike.

220
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,180
In the center of my trap is going to be all rock candy

221
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,130
to lure people to come and step on it

222
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,590
and try to get some little candies.

223
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,280
- [Devan] Bro, it looks as painful as stepping on legos.

224
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,113
- I didn't even think about that.

225
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:14,670
Yeah, stepping on legos is probably about

226
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,720
like the top five things I don't want to do.

227
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,893
- Now, I could see someone trying to lick it.

228
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:20,060
I looks really tasty.

229
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,169
- [Collins] Dude, I cannot wait to eat this thing.

230
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,901
(upbeat music)

231
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:25,980
- Well, for the first time in history,

232
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,420
I am actually done before Collins is.

233
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,999
- I'm almost done

234
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,250
just gotta add a little more rock candy to my trap.

235
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,193
- Really, is that even necessary, bro?

236
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,112
- Oh, yeah, this is super necessary Devan.

237
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:34,945
This is how I'm gonna trap them,

238
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:36,010
see yours looks all scary,

239
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,040
no one is going to go there.

240
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,370
Sorry.

241
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,040
Done, so you guys get to comment down below

242
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
who won this round, who made a better one

243
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,950
and you guys remember that's the trap in the middle.

244
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,596
We'll be eating at the end of the video

245
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:47,040
right now we are on to the next one.

246
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,873
- Hey Collins.

247
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,453
- Oh!

248
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,390
Yo, I'm gonna need a med kit to fix my face

249
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,090
so right now here is how you made a candy med kit

250
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,621
you can actually eat and then it rejuvenates you.

251
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,620
Woo-hoo!

252
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,230
First, I gotta frost my cake.

253
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,700
Now we're going to use this froster.

254
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,141
- See, that's the hardest part about frosting the cakes

255
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:05,391
is that you've got to get that even frosting.

256
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,730
- Jaggedy raggedy frost. - [Devan] It can't be dude.

257
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,030
- This thing is in my way.

258
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,970
- Alright, next up we go for that

259
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,240
red stripe down the middle.

260
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,540
Alright, Collins, you do you, bro, you do you.

261
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,970
- You gotta stay with the precision here.

262
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,990
Well, looking at it, I think that I messed it up

263
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,680
because Devan's looks a lot better than mine.

264
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,690
It looks all spiraly and

265
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:27,607
- It's gonna taste great though, right?

266
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,690
- I don't understand how yours is looking so good

267
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,517
and mine is looking raggedy and jaggedy bro.

268
00:08:30,517 --> 00:08:32,763
I hope this stays on, that's not working.

269
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,550
Schmear. - Schmear.

270
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,383
Schmear it around.

271
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,540
Schmear it across the front.

272
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,420
It is time to add the plus thing on the top of it

273
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,310
which stands for med kit, I guess.

274
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,423
So, there we go, that is my finished one and now I wait.

275
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,980
- Hey Colls, I have some frosting on my elbow.

276
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,180
- You should try to lick it, bro.

277
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,185
- What?

278
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,188
- Did you know that it's actually

279
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:56,021
literally impossible to lick something off of your elbow?

280
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:56,854
Like, try it right now.

281
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:58,612
- I can't reach it.

282
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:00,930
- This is now an upgrade to the med kit

283
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,720
which you can only get if you're an experienced player

284
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,720
it's a handle so you can carry your med kit.

285
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,220
If I don't win this round, I will be so upset.

286
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,320
- Alright, so we're done with that

287
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,210
now we just have to add the

288
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,520
line around it and then I'm done.

289
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,780
- Yeah, that's the easiest part.

290
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,830
- Really, it seems like the hardest part.

291
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,650
- You get to comment down below who won this round.

292
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,010
I think my banana handle, woo!

293
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,120
Clocks the competition.

294
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,007
We're eating these at the end of the video

295
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:23,792
and right now we are on to the next round.

296
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:25,764
(yells)

297
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:26,810
- Battle bus! - What're you doing bro?

298
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,436
Yes, it's battle bus.

299
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,166
- Okay, well guys we're making the battle bus,

300
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,571
and we get to make our very own

301
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,640
and you get to decide, who makes the crazier battle bus.

302
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,473
So right now

303
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:35,710
- It's flyin', you know like a battle bus.

304
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,543
- Let's go

305
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,456
- It's like a pillow dude, I just wanna just take a nap.

306
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:40,280
- So I've got my wheels right here,

307
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,090
and this is how you attach the wheels to the bus.

308
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,947
Wrong, no, no I need to take the paper off here so.

309
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:46,130
- There he goes man, there he goes.

310
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,680
Just usin' his mouth, it's so effective.

311
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,121
- Ooh, yeah, look at them wheels though.

312
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:53,720
- The wheels on my bus go round and round.

313
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,279
- They look kind of like, stuck on.

314
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,112
- Some of you may have noticed that

315
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:57,780
this wheel here is not touching the ground.

316
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,000
And if you didn't notice that - That's why there's that side

317
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,360
There we go, ooh we got some Twinkies!

318
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,217
This smells like a banana.

319
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:05,773
You know what my bus needs? - What?

320
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:07,955
- No.

321
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:10,450
- That is why my battle bus is the greatest of all times, so

322
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,470
Actually worked, alright cool.

323
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,705
Now we got some bing dings, or bing bings.

324
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:14,538
- Those are bing bings bro.

325
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:16,360
- I lowkey wanna actually eat one of these.

326
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:18,660
It looks like worm, cheers?

327
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,793
- Alright, here we go.

328
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,313
- [Both] Three, two, one.

329
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:24,012
- Wait wait, first, three second like challenge.

330
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:25,080
We wanna see if you guys can

331
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,510
like this video in three seconds.

332
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,343
Are you ready?

333
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:30,070
- [Both] Three, two, one, done.

334
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,760
- So now let's see how these bing bings taste.

335
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,700
Bing bing bing bing bing

336
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,250
- They smell like strawberries.

337
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,587
That's not what I expected.

338
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:42,816
I'm not gonna take another bite.

339
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,250
- The bing bing is a no no.

340
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,168
These are the headlights. - Nice!

341
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:47,180
One of my headlights is kinda wonky,

342
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,930
it's like pointing in the same direction as the other one.

343
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,810
Now it's time to add some windows to my battle bus

344
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,890
because I want the people inside to be like,

345
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,050
woo, is that a banana?

346
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,572
You know what I mean?

347
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:55,460
And then we go, oh!

348
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,640
- Alright, here we go.

349
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,700
- I think that's a waste of time.

350
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,200
So I understand you try to make the whole like

351
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,945
hot air balloon thing, but bro,

352
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:02,666
Say goodbye to my banana, you never

353
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,126
wanna waste a piece of your banana.

354
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:05,227
This banana is actually gonna

355
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:07,271
be the bumper of my battle bus.

356
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:08,992
That way, if you ever come late to the battle bus,

357
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:09,991
you try to get on you're like,

358
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:11,837
you just slip off the banana peel.

359
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,775
Then we're gonna go, oh. - Oh bro look at this.

360
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,886
No, Devan. - I added a plane dude.

361
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,316
Look at this, it's a banana handle

362
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:20,030
on a battle bus, it's unprecedented.

363
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,400
Bam, there you have it, the battle buses are completed.

364
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,740
I must say, I think the banana

365
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,846
handle takes home the victory.

366
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:26,679
So you guys gonna comment down below,

367
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,020
let us know who won this round.

368
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,120
We'll be easting these at the end,

369
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,070
and right now we are onto the next one.

370
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,690
Now is the moment you've all been waiting for.

371
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,167
It's time to eat and feast on these DIY

372
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,280
edible Fortnite candies, working it off

373
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,200
right now with the harvesting tool.

374
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,010
Mine is the flamingo, I'm gonna try

375
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,640
to get some of the hat, some of the Twinkie,

376
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,600
and a little banana. - Bro are you ready for this?

377
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,003
- [Both] Three, two, one.

378
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:51,410
(crunching)

379
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,533
- Oh yeah bro. - Whoa.

380
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:57,260
Oh, the different textures bro

381
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,400
- Next up, we've got the battle bus.

382
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,958
- Or whatever that is.

383
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:01,959
- This is my battle bus.

384
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:02,792
This is the front of my battle bus,

385
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:04,516
I'm gonna try to take a bite of it right now,

386
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,950
see if I can just eat my battle bus's face off.

387
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,193
Three, two, one.

388
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,855
- Oh! - That's awesome.

389
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,707
- I got a piece of (mumbles)

390
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:15,297
The banana. - Oh yeah.

391
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:16,330
- It was that good?

392
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,530
It seems like a weird combo.

393
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,350
- Boom, spike trap, it's time to get trap spiked.

394
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,380
- Oh no, alright.

395
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,540
- So we'll be eating this spike trap,

396
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,880
then we'll go for the med kit and then

397
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,310
we'll finish it all off with some delicious chug jug.

398
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,387
So here's the issue with this trap.

399
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:29,450
You see, you go for the lick on all the candy

400
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,207
and then you get spiked in the face.

401
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:33,262
(mumbling)

402
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:34,384
- Actually that was pretty good dude.

403
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:35,500
- I got it!

404
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,501
- I'm gonna try to combine 'em together.

405
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:37,334
I'm gonna take a bit of this.

406
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,833
- Oh, whoa, holy cow, whoa this is super good bro.

407
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:47,020
- That hurt.

408
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,456
- This is amazing!

409
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:49,440
I gotta admit, I don't think the banana handle

410
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,870
was the best option for my kit

411
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,570
'cause it all fell off and turned soggy.

412
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,950
That's disgusting!

413
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,110
So now that's how you do it Devan,

414
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,990
take your hand like this - Okay.

415
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,587
And then you gotta just scoop in.

416
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:00,720
- Ew. - And then ta-da!

417
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,370
- Yep, and then you say goodbye to it.

418
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,220
- Alright cheers. - Three, two, one.

419
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,742
Uh, whoa. - Dude.

420
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:09,751
Whoa.

421
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:10,751
- There's like layers of the cake

422
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:11,697
- They're strawberry.

423
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:15,943
- The best med kit ever, I hope you (mumbling)

424
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,846
it is time for the candy pinata llama.

425
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,548
Now we were gonna show you how to make this

426
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:22,272
but unfortunately, it just took forever.

427
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:23,271
- It was so boring.

428
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:24,460
- Basically like a whole bunch of fondant,

429
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,910
some cut up sour strips, and Hershey's chocolate

430
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,520
and this thing looks amazing, so right now,

431
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,243
it's time to take a bite of this time.

432
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,219
Oh my gosh it looks so cool.

433
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:37,864
Just gonna go for it, here we go, three, two, one.

434
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:39,281
- Oh, is it good?

435
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,288
- Yeah it's a little bit sour though.

436
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,461
- Oh, where should I go?

437
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:44,782
I'm just gonna go. - On the neck? Oh my God

438
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,932
(yelling)

439
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:48,429
- Now it's time to drink the chug jugs and guys,

440
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,030
comment down below, what are some other

441
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,536
Fortnite items you want us to turn into DIY edible food?

442
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:54,290
- And remember Collins, we only

443
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,787
have 15 seconds to drink this, you ready?

444
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:59,370
- 15 seconds, alright let's go!

445
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,960
- Dude, how can anybody drink this in 15 seconds bro?

446
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,793
- There is no way.

447
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:06,040
Oh my gosh, if you wanna see another video

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,300
