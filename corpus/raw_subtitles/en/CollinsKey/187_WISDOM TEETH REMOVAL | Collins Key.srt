00:00:00,108 --> 00:00:02,569
- Hi guys, it's Collins Key.

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,442
Welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:05,442 --> 00:00:08,275
I just got my wisdom teeth removed

4
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:12,801
and it's feeling really weird right now

5
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:16,021
but I love you guys, enjoy this week's video.

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:19,232
Give it a thumbs up for encouragement.

7
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:21,294
Oh my god, I love Ratchet.

8
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:23,377
(whines)

9
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:27,092
I love my viewers, you guys mean the world to me.

10
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:28,842
- Swing around, yeah.

11
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:36,128
All right, go ahead and sit down.

12
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:41,212
- (sighs) Feels really nice.

13
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:43,182
- All right.

14
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,805
- The Jurassic Park ride.

15
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:47,426
Haha, bird, go away.

16
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:49,154
- No, that's a lizard. (laughs)

17
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:50,737
- Oh. Hello lizard.

18
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:54,626
- He's probably gonna feel loopy for the rest of the day.

19
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:56,678
- Whoa, this is weird.

20
00:00:56,678 --> 00:00:58,117
- [Cameraman] How do you feel?

21
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:01,700
- Uh, everything, it makes a lot more sense

22
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,056
but not really.

23
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:05,331
I wanna work out right now,

24
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,554
but they said I wasn't allowed to.

25
00:01:07,554 --> 00:01:09,918
I want to lift this whole car up.

26
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:10,975
- [Cameraman] Lift it up?

27
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:13,110
- Yes, with my muscles.

28
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,122
- [Mom] What kind of muscles?

29
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:16,110
- All of them.

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,083
The majority of them, at least.

31
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,377
Whoa, you can't do that to me, mom.

32
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:22,212
I'd be very sensitive right now.

33
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,295
(growls)

34
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:31,276
- [Man] Are you singing a song?

35
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:34,859
- No, I'm exercising my upper neck muscles.

36
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,639
(mumbles)

37
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:41,522
- [Mom] No, put it on your face.

38
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:45,065
- Oh, oh, okay. (sighs)

39
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:46,641
- [Mom] Keep the swelling down.

40
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:50,379
- Oh, why didn't you tell me earlier?

41
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:53,057
Why was she walking like that?

42
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:56,577
She was just walking in the middle of the sidewalk.

43
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:59,204
- [Mom] Perfect, no, no, not so much.

44
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:01,318
Collin, stand up, sit up.

45
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:02,164
(laughs)

46
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,522
Collin, sit up.

47
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:06,666
(laughs and snorts)

48
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,381
Sit up. - I can't.

49
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:11,027
- I know, but you gotta stay focused.

50
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:12,439
- Whoa.

51
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,939
They put me like on this table

52
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,497
and I was on the table and they were like

53
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:20,747
"hey" and I was like "hey!"

54
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,178
and then they like had this needle

55
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:29,349
and they took the needle and they put it in my arm.

56
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,226
And I was like (screams)

57
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:34,203
and I was like chill, I was relaxed.

58
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:36,923
I think I'm gonna start drooling.

59
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,590
Cause I literally can't swallow.

60
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:43,789
I can't swallow anything.

61
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:46,149
Why?

62
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:47,310
- [Mom] We're gonna get you a Jamba Juice

63
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,464
but you can't use a straw.

64
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:51,226
- Yeah, I love Jamba Juice!

65
00:02:51,226 --> 00:02:53,226
(sighs)

66
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:58,377
(incoherent noises)

67
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:04,494
- [Man] What's your favorite video game?

68
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:05,537
What about Battlefront?

69
00:03:05,537 --> 00:03:07,537
(yells)

70
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:10,254
Yeah?

71
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,464
(yells)

72
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:16,452
- Can you figure out how to get in that chair?

73
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:17,648
Okay, good.

74
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:18,960
- I made it!

75
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,887
- Move your legs over.

76
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:22,637
Oops, nope nope nope.

77
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:26,129
(laughs)

78
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,175
You gotta sit up a little bit.

79
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,747
This is the hardest part, this is hard.

80
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:33,899
Okay, see if you can, there you go.

81
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:35,374
- I did it!

82
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:36,861
- [Man] Are you excited for Jamba Juice?

83
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:37,794
- Uh-Huh!

84
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:38,627
Feed me.

85
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,184
(coughs)

86
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:45,939
- You can close your mouth to swallow.

87
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,089
- I really can't feel this part of my face.

88
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:50,485
- I know, is it numb all the way up to here?

89
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:51,836
- No, no, no, yeah.

90
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:53,591
Don't touch me, don't touch me mom.

91
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,424
Amateur.

92
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:56,674
Why do you guys support me?

93
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,232
You guys are freaking awesome!

94
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:01,431
- More jello cups?

95
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:03,390
- I get to eat jello?

96
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,836
- Yeah, or I can get you sorbet later.

97
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:07,943
- What?

98
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:08,776
- Yeah.

99
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:10,435
- Oh my god, that's awesome!

100
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:11,854
- Yeah, I know.

101
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,104
- I'm so happy.

102
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,503
(slurping and giggling)

103
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:31,772
Shh, I'm stealing her tissues.

104
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:37,119
I didn't touch your tissues, mom.

105
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,119
jello! Yeah!

106
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:44,008
- That's good, that's good, okay, glad you're excited.

107
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:44,841
(laughs)

108
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:47,091
Okay, slow down, slow down.

109
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:53,514
Wait, stay there!

110
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:55,638
Where are you going?

111
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:58,013
Oh, you're gonna go get the, you can.

112
00:04:58,013 --> 00:04:59,658
You can feed yourself.

113
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:01,343
- One small bite for man,

114
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:05,302
one giant bite for mankind. (slurps)

115
00:05:05,302 --> 00:05:06,326
(laughs)

116
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:08,409
(chokes)

117
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:11,405
(yells)

118
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:12,757
- You can have your jello cup back.

119
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:13,853
- Yeah!

120
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:15,428

Until then. (yells)

And now I'm gonna get up, and keep filming.

130

Okay, let's go.
