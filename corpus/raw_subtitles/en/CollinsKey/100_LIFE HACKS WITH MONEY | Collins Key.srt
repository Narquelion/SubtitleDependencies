00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:01,662
- What's up guys it's Collins Key and for today's video

2
00:00:01,662 --> 00:00:03,794
I'm actually gonna be showing and teaching you

3
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:06,629
an easy life hack with a dollar bill.

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:07,953
So all you have to do is grab a dollar bill

5
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:09,311
and follow along, just take your bill,

6
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:11,857
you're just gonna wanna fold it up just like this

7
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:13,086
and I guess the easiest way to describe it,

8
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:14,720
you're just gonna fold it into a little tiny packet.

9
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,446
And now all you have to do with this packet

10
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:19,643
is just take it and twist it,

11
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:21,837
and that activates the money hack.

12
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:24,019
So check this out, now when you unfold this bill,

13
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:26,069
it's gonna blow your mind.

14
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:27,258
Actually I figured this out a little while ago,

15
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:29,973
it's my favorite thing to do, it freaks people out.

16
00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:30,806
Watch.

17
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:33,377
(snapping)

18
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:34,210
Done.

19
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:37,967
Looks kinda crazy right,

20
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:41,134
now let's make it even crazier, watch.

21
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:43,583
(snapping)

22
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,403
It's all it takes.

23
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:47,368
Just like that, I want you to look at this,

24
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:49,831
there's no tape, there's no glue or anything on this bill.

25
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,394
So if this video blew your mind,

26
00:00:51,394 --> 00:00:53,069
make sure you share it with all of your friends

27
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:54,012
and give this video

28
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,625

29
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,458
