1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:04,041
(driving electronic music)

2
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:09,273
- Have you ever stuffed your face with so much ice cream

3
00:00:09,273 --> 00:00:10,882
that it gave you a brain freeze?

4
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:12,732
Well today, we're turning just everyday foods

5
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:15,375
into the ultimate brain freeze with liquid nitrogen.

6
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:16,786
And I asked you guys on Instagram,

7
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:19,527
"What are some crazy foods you would love to see me freeze"

8
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:21,303
"and then smash with a hammer?"

9
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:22,856
So, right now, let's do it.

10
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,151
We're kicking it off with some Peeps, y'all!

11
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:26,243
(crickets chirping)

12
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:27,393
Let's just forget I ever did that.

13
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:29,336
And how this works, there are three steps to it.

14
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:31,687
Step one, we're gonna place a normal Peep down

15
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:32,753
and then smash it.

16
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:34,529
Step two, we're gonna take another Peep,

17
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:36,431
deep freeze it, and then step three,

18
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:39,200
place it down and then smash the deep freezed Peep.

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,485
Let's peep this out.

20
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:41,509
(laughing) I can't do that.

21
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,711
That's like some random food channels line.

22
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:45,219
No one's gonna get that reference, but Devin w...

23
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,671
Let's, let's go.

24
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,573
It's time to choose the sacrificial Peep.

25
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:51,624
I choose, this one right...

26
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:54,727
Here we go, step one, smash the normal Peep.

27
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:56,462
(hammer bang)

28
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,029
Turn it like a Peep pancake.

29
00:00:58,029 --> 00:01:00,934
(upbeat music)

30
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:02,668
Let's see what happens when we deep freeze it.

31
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:04,110
Alright so I'm using this dipper right here

32
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,354
to get the liquid nitrogen,

33
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:08,081
and we're gonna dump it on the Peep to deep freeze it.

34
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:09,690
So this is going to take some accuracy,

35
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,257
see if I can get it.

36
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:13,840
(upbeat music)

37
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,130
It's like sizzling off the...

38
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,290
It's cracking!

39
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,564
Alright here we go, round two.

40
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:21,424
This stuff is hitting the table, this stuff is crazy,

41
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:23,044
this stuff is super dangerous by the way,

42
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:24,486
so if you ever do this, make sure

43
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:27,297
you do it with parental supervision.

44
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:28,864
(chuckles)

45
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:29,697
This looks crazy,

46
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:30,755
oh I want to like touch it.

47
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:32,166
It's s... you can hear it cracking,

48
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,357
it is solid right now!

49
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:35,217
This is crazy, I'm gonna do one more round.

50
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:38,274
I feel so bad man, this Peep, rest in peace bro.

51
00:01:38,274 --> 00:01:40,107
No, rest in peep, hah.

52
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:43,713
But before we smash the frozen one, I've got a challenge.

53
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:45,637
I want to see if you can subscribe to this channel,

54
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:47,654
and turn on the channel post notifications

55
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:49,232
in five seconds, here we go.

56
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:52,065
Five, four, three, two, one, done.

57
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:55,472
If you can do that, comment down below "Keyper Squad".

58
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:56,774
Right now, we're smashing it.

59
00:01:56,774 --> 00:02:00,691
Three, two, one, (hammer bang)

60
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:04,538
That was crazy, that was so cool!

61
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:06,408
I am lit, that was so sick!

62
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:08,425
Alright, next one here we go.

63
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:11,592
(gentle upbeat music)

64
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,025
Shoutout to everyone who suggested

65
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:16,105
one of my favorite foods, sushi.

66
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:17,714
So, we're gonna be freezing this stuff,

67
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:19,083
we're also gonna be smashing regular,

68
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,326
and then of course,

69
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,036
going to be eating the stuff (laughs)

70
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:23,168
Let's go.

71
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:25,041
This one hits home, (hammer bang)

72
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:25,874
(ghasps)

73
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:28,457
(upbeat music)

74
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:31,968
Out of all the ones I did not expect

75
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:35,364
to blow up all over me, it was my friend sushi!

76
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,558
So this piece here looks like the most colorful one,

77
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,677
so we're gonna do this one.

78
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:40,630
This feels like you're at an expensive restaurant,

79
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,623
and like you know when you see them

80
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:42,950
doing crazy things with the food,

81
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,194
like using blow torches and stuff.

82
00:02:44,194 --> 00:02:45,719
This feels like something you would see

83
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,586
in an expensive restaurant.

84
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:48,739
They're like "Oh you want your sushi a little bit colder?"

85
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,108
And then's like (hisses)

86
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:52,775
(playful music)

87
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:59,125
Huh, it's making me sneeze.

88
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,072
(sneezes) (air horn)

89
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:00,905
So here's what's gonna happen,

90
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,239
I'm actually, I'm gonna tilt this back...

91
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,523
Oh my gosh, it's like half frozen.

92
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:06,446
The bottom is rock solid frozen,

93
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:08,898
but the top, the top is not cooperating.

94
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,099
Come on sushi, you supposed to be my best friend.

95
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,830
(funk music)

96
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,663
Aw, spicy!

97
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,267
The sushi is proving to be a lot more difficult

98
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:18,446
than I initially anticipated.

99
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:19,923
So right now, we're actually going to take

100
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:22,867
the whole thing, and submerge it in the liquid nitrogen.

101
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,632
No more of this foo-foo little drizzling.

102
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:26,062
You know things are getting extreme,

103
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:27,781
when the camo glasses come out.

104
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:29,415
Whoa, the whole world is very yellow at the moment.

105
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:31,756
Alright, we're gonna dump this whole thing.

106
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:34,013
Here we go, (laughs menacingly)

107
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,010
yes, it's not heavy at all, okay.

108
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,839
Alright here we go, this is super dangerous.

109
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:40,256
(funk music)

110
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:44,775
Oh my gosh.

111
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:45,608
Alright here we go.

112
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:46,459
I would use chopsticks, but you know what,

113
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,911
now is not the time for tradition.

114
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,053
It's not coming off, it's frozen.

115
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:51,911
We're going with this piece!

116
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:53,295
(funk music)

117
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:54,128
It's in there guys.

118
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:55,134
We're making a delicacy right now,

119
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,688
the sushi is in there, in the liquid nitrogen.

120
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:59,341
It's a frozen block!

121
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:00,889
It's literally a frozen block!

122
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,644
Alright guys, time to smash it.

123
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:06,350
Three, two, one (hammer bang)

124
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,100
(tropical music)

125
00:04:10,326 --> 00:04:11,243
That one...

126
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:14,849
Ah, that scratched my eye on the way out.

127
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:16,205
Who ever knew the safety glasses

128
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,310
would be the most dangerous part

129
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,688
of that whole operation right there (laughs)

130
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:20,793
Let's do the next one.

131
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,632
I've been instructed I'm not allowed to touch the donuts,

132
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:24,146
because they're afraid I'm gonna eat it.

133
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:26,149
I doe-nut know why, (buzzer)

134
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:26,982
nope that's bad.

135
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:29,484
Alright right now, it's time to smash a donut, let's do it.

136
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:31,481
This one might be kind of graphic,

137
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,645
you may wanna look away.

138
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,673
(hammer bangs)

139
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,512
(hammer bangs)

140
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,738
(hammer bangs)

141
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,539
Okay, I thought this one was gonna blow up and go crazy,

142
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:42,979
but it just literally just like flattened.

143
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:44,177
Let's see what happens with a frozen one.

144
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:45,450
Alright we've got the tongs right now,

145
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,171
the donut is going into the liquid nitrogen.

146
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:49,193
(sizzling)

147
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:51,478
Oh my gosh, it's floating!

148
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:52,908
This thing is like floating on it man.

149
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:56,019
I gotta submerge it, submerge, go submarine mode (chuckles)

150
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,078
It's a submarine donut!

151
00:04:57,078 --> 00:05:01,722
Here we go, three, two, one (hammer bangs)

152
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:04,499
(upbeat dramatic music)

153
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:05,846
The hammer's like smoking!

154
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:07,602
Aw I love this stuff man.

155
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:08,865
That sounded like glass breaking,

156
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:10,341
like for a second I was like oh my gosh,

157
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:12,515
I'm about to get hit with like a shard of glass donut.

158
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:14,410
It makes no sense, I'm hyped, this is crazy!

159
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,862
(upbeat dramatic music)

160
00:05:16,862 --> 00:05:17,800
Let's go to the next one.

161
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,094
Next up we are freezing and smashing Oreos.

162
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:22,844
(cheerful music)

163
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:29,020
- [Woman Off Screen] Hey, we need that for the video!

164
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,937
- Here we go, (dramatic music)

165
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,880
I literally just thought a piece of this flew off,

166
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,348
into the liquid nitrogen container.

167
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:41,066
Luckily it's closed, we're all good.

168
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,193
Otherwise it could have erupted, I don't know.

169
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:45,450
So let's now freeze it, and see what happens.

170
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,014
We're using the different technique again for this Oreo.

171
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,431
(funk music)

172
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,809
Like this stuff just sizzles,

173
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,444
which is the craziest thing about it.

174
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:56,707
Let's smash this Oreo!

175
00:05:56,707 --> 00:06:00,589
Three, two, one (hammer bang) (bullet rebounding)

176
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:01,422
Oh, what!

177
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:04,685
Look at this, it didn't even break!

178
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:07,045
What, I am smashing this again fam!

179
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,633
What is going on!

180
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:11,772
(dramatic music)

181
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,596
Attempt number two, let's do this.

182
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:16,100
(hammer bangs) (bullet rebounding)

183
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,484
(laughs)

184
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:20,707
(dramatic music)

185
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:22,540
Not a pickle in a bag.

186
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:24,735
But it'll do.

187
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:27,568
You have to eat a pickle in a bag.

188
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,011
Alright here we go.

189
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:34,831
Oh no, it's already getting juicy (groans)

190
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:39,364
I hate the small of pickles (groans)

191
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:40,757
I smell like pickles y'all.

192
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:42,466
I don't even want to do this.

193
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:44,036
It feels like a messy challenge all over again.

194
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:48,203
It's like pickle, just, just nastiness! (gibberish)

195
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:51,596
- [Woman Off Screen] Eww, it's like jelly!

196
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:52,497
- Oh, it's in my eyeball!

197
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:54,726
Oh that burns, that burns a lot!

198
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:57,059
Here we go, three, two, one.

199
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:03,225
Oh no, I can't believe it didn't do anything.

200
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:04,534
I guess we'll have to freeze it.

201
00:07:04,534 --> 00:07:06,327
No I can't, I can't do that.

202
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,909
We gotta go for it. (hammer bangs)

203
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:09,986
(groans)

204
00:07:09,986 --> 00:07:12,736
(dramatic music)

205
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,308
I got pickle all over me!

206
00:07:15,308 --> 00:07:16,413
Alright let's freeze it.

207
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:19,943
It looks like just like bird poo just (squirts with mouth)

208
00:07:19,943 --> 00:07:23,184
(chuckles) Now this, is what you call a juicy pickle.

209
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,349
Here we go, oh I need my... (chuckles)

210
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:26,955
Almost put that in without my glove.

211
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:28,544
That woulda been very bad!

212
00:07:28,544 --> 00:07:30,624
Okay, the juciest of all pickles.

213
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,222
Yo, this is so wild!

214
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:34,219
There's almost like a, I don't know how to describe it,

215
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:36,968
there's like a layer of mist over the top of it.

216
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,565
But you can't see it, but the moment the pickle

217
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:40,042
gets close to it, look at this.

218
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,027
It like envelopes the pickle.

219
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:41,860
You see that, look.

220
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,562
It's like a layer over the top of it.

221
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,281
I'm sure there's like scientific reason for it,

222
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,114
but that's wild.

223
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:49,293
Alright here we go, we're gonna plop the pickle in.

224
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:50,336
I can't see the pickle man.

225
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,740
You know what, there's just not enough

226
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,096
liquid nitrogen in there,

227
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:56,746
we've gotta fill it up a little more.

228
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:57,712
Yeah.

229
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:59,923
Pickles been in there for quite a little while,

230
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:03,276
we've got the hammer right now, and let's pull it out.

231
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:05,616
It's actually cracked!

232
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,149
Look at this.

233
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,173
Can you see, like it's got a crack

234
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,567
right along it right there.

235
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:11,644
This is gonna be explosive.

236
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:15,811
Here we go, three, two, one (smash) (shattering)

237
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:19,632
(dramatic music)

238
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:23,654
That one sounded like glass shattering.

239
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:26,404
(dramatic music)

240
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:30,322
This one is the most popular item you guys suggested,

241
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:31,572
it's a piece...

242
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,421
a piece, of pizza.

243
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:38,886
Sorry, no more uh, cheesy jokes. (percussive sting)

244
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,636
Get it, 'cause it's a cheese p...

245
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,152
I'm not looking forward to this one.

246
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:44,985
This is gonna go everywhere.

247
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:48,025
Three two one (hammer bangs)

248
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:51,322
that was it? (hammer bangs) (hammer bangs)

249
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,905
(upbeat music)

250
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:58,901
Hey guys, it looks like a topographical map of Utah,

251
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:01,344
Haha jokes, dad jokes.

252
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:03,294
For those of you who are pizza lovers,

253
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,520
this might be hard to watch.

254
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,103
(upbeat music)

255
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,390
So that's just like just a part of it,

256
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,942
and you can already tell the difference.

257
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,084
Like it's rock solid.

258
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:16,801
Wait, we're gonna go with the whole piece of pizza in there.

259
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,211
Ooh man, it's sizzling.

260
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,474
The moment it touches it,

261
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,796
the whole consistency of it is completely changes.

262
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,598
This no longer feels like a piece of pizza,

263
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:25,836
it feels like a slab of rock.

264
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:27,317
(grinding)

265
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,527
Listen to that sound, crazy!

266
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,790
Alright, time to smash it.

267
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,137
Here we go.

268
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,301
(hammer bangs) (hammer bangs)

269
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:36,051
(tropical music)

270
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:40,545
Okay before I go for this last one,

271
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:41,725
it is just shattered.

272
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:42,563
Come here, look at this.

273
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:44,323
Like the cheese actually shattered on it.

274
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:46,032
Like I can kinda pick it up a little bit.

275
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:47,515
It looks crazy!

276
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:49,496
Like the whole thing is just kinda broken apart.

277
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:51,688
I'm gonna give it one final smash right now.

278
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:52,951
There's a big one, here we go.

279
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:56,868
Three, two, don't want to break the plate, one.

280
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:00,676
(hammer smashes) (chuckles)

281
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:01,734
Yeah, that was cool.

282
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:05,151
(upbeat strumming music)

283
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:09,388
Have you ever seen those commercials

284
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:11,227
where they try to make eating a burger

285
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:13,344
look like the hottest thing on the entire planet?

286
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,620
Well right now, we're not gonna do that.

287
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,255
This is gonna be the exact opposite of that.

288
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:20,106
Like after this, no one is gonna wanna eat this burger.

289
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:21,611
So, (hammer bangs)

290
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,361
(dramatic music)

291
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,115
This here, has got icicles like all the way around it now.

292
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:30,620
And this side you can kinda like scoop it off,

293
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,276
it looks like snow almost.

294
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:35,598
So right now, the camo glasses are going back on.

295
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:36,778
We're about to fill it up again,

296
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:38,051
and this burger's going down.

297
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,239
Here we go, the moment of truth.

298
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,704
About to pop the burger into the liquid nitrogen.

299
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:44,821
Oh man, it's going everywhere.

300
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:45,654
Okay

301
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:46,809
So the burger's in, I gotta keep it together,

302
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:48,453
so I gotta push it down quickly.

303
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:49,428
What's happening, I can't see it,

304
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:50,766
my glasses are like impeding my vision,

305
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,066
and I'm like everything's so yellow!

306
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,738
I can't tell where the burger's at anymore.

307
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:54,571
It's having a crazy reaction,

308
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,060
this one by far the craziest.

309
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,370
Hopefully, the burger will freeze.

310
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,438
This one's the most difficult though,

311
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,834
because there's so many layers to what's going on.

312
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,664
Like the burger just has a ton of different layers,

313
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:03,890
and so I don't know if it's gonna be able to

314
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,803
freeze through every single layer.

315
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:06,825
So I'm gonna keep this one in here

316
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:08,366
longer than I normally would.

317
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,075
Well the cheese is definitely no longer melted,

318
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:10,908
that's for sure.

319
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:11,868
In case you guys ever wanted to know,

320
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:15,583
this is the secret recipe for the Krabby Patty.

321
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,416
Y'all didn't even know,

322
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,643
liquid nitrogen was the key all along.

323
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:19,509
(cracking)

324
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:21,877
(upbeat music)

325
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:23,057
It's literally cracking!

326
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:23,890
Alright, here we go,

327
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,223
three, two, one.

328
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:29,326
(hammer bangs) (laughs)

329
00:11:29,326 --> 00:11:32,076
(dramatic music)

330
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:36,405
It's like a magic trick man!

331
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,238
It's just gone!

332
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,574
Well there's a chunk of it over here.

333
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:39,837
Woo, woo, woo.

334
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:42,364
It's like so cold, it's so hot right now.

335
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:44,816
That makes no sense, but if you touch this,

336
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,153
you can feel it even through these gloves,

337
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:47,704
like it's like a burn on your finger.

338
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:50,287
(upbeat music)

339
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:53,022
Really guys, eggs?

340
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:55,862
You know I don't like messy videos.

341
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:58,101
(screeching)

342
00:11:58,101 --> 00:11:59,851
Nunununo, no, no, no!

343
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:05,453
(chuckles)

344
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:06,855
This is gonna be so bad.

345
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:07,793
I'm doing this for you, here we go.

346
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:11,960
Three, oh no, two, one. (hammer smashes)

347
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:17,740
I'm good, it didn't touch me at all!

348
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,941
Alright cool, next one let's go (lightly chuckles)

349
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:22,524
(upbeat music)

350
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:25,530
Here we go.

351
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:28,570
(laughs)

352
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,372
I gotta say, I'm very grateful that I still

353
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:31,672
have a face at the moment,

354
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:33,428
because that slipped, and you saw that stuff

355
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,178
shoot out everywhere.

356
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:39,260
(slow motion laughing)

357
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,561
And if that were to touch my skin,

358
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:43,171
that would burn my skin, and my skin would instantly die.

359
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,192
All's well that ends well.

360
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:46,236
The coolest thing, is that when it fell in there

361
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:47,787
it actually cracked.

362
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,780
And look at it, it's like the opposite of scrambled eggs.

363
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,886
So guys, we're gonna put a full one in. (groans)

364
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:54,437
So guys, we're gonna put a full one in there now,

365
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:55,700
just so we know what like,

366
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,502
the whole egg will actually look like.

367
00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,852
Alright, so the full egg actually cracked

368
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:01,654
while it was inside.

369
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:03,660
So I don't know what kind of effect that will have.

370
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,970
We're gonna do this one first,

371
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,809
and then next we're gonna do this mutant egg.

372
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:08,527
The craziest thing about this one,

373
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:10,691
is that it cracked, but the shell stayed intact,

374
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:13,227
but only the egg whites actually came out of the egg,

375
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:15,344
but the shell it's still full intact.

376
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:19,639
Here we go, three, two, one. (hammer bangs)

377
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,306
(upbeat music)

378
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,177
Oh my gosh, literally powderized it.

379
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:27,933
We're going for egg number two right now,

380
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,400
here we go guys, the mutant egg.

381
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,369
Three, (chuckles) two, one. (hammer smashes) (crunching)

382
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:36,952
(upbeat music)

383
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:40,917
It's literally just powder.

384
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:42,431
So I don't think I've ever seen eggs

385
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:44,837
prepared in this particular fashion before.

386
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:47,420
(upbeat music)

387
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:50,967
You guys suggested Twinkies,

388
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:53,634
I suggest I do it like Salt Bae.

389
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,537
So let's see what happens.

390
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,051
You guys, I'm not excited about this one.

391
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,540
This, is gonna be juicy.

392
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,849
Here we go.

393
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:06,004
(hammer bangs)

394
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:08,921
(Illuminati music)

395
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:13,362
(digital music)

396
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:15,394
(hammer banging)

397
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:16,788
(hammer banging)

398
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:18,599
(hammer banging)

399
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,512
This experiment has been so full of surprises,

400
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:23,419
like the ones you'd expect to just explode everywhere,

401
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,682
have done nothing, and then the ones

402
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:26,531
that just came out of no where, sushi.

403
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:27,877
Why would the sushi go everywhere,

404
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:30,004
but the Twinkie filling inside of it would not.

405
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:34,326
It's actually stuck to the just ta... it's just.

406
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:35,605
(bangs on table)

407
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:36,580
I don't know what to say.

408
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,054
Everyone say goodbye to the Twinkie.

409
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:44,085
Here we go, making the plunge. (sizzling)

410
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:45,252
Whoa, hold up.

411
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:48,898
My tongs, got stuck to it.

412
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:53,141
Alright I'm gonna have to use a different Twinkie,

413
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:55,073
this thing is just woo, messed up.

414
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:57,766
I'm just gonna have to like, kinda like plop it in.

415
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:58,599
Very safely.

416
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,763
Wanna go far away from it, here we go.

417
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:03,107
Three, two, one, here we go, ooh.

418
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:05,271
The Twinkie's just like, floating along the surface.

419
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,868
Alright, so it's kinda sinking in a little bit,

420
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:10,036
I'm gonna try to like rotate it.

421
00:15:10,036 --> 00:15:12,237
Flip it upside down would be like ideal,

422
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:13,101
oh okay there we go, yep.

423
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:15,181
The first time we did this, nothing happened.

424
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,838
This time, after it's been frozen, here we go.

425
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:19,509
About to smash it, and then eat it.

426
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:20,912
But first, I need your help.

427
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,946

Yes, we're gonna be rocking sumo suits.

431
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,064

About to smash it, and then we're gonna be eating it.

438
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:44,063
Here we go, three, two, one. (hammer banging) (cracking)

439
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:46,890
(laughing)

440
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,237
That was crazy!

441
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:51,404
(slow dramatic music)

442
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:54,912
Alright here we go,

443
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,745
oh there's a chunk right here.

444
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:58,370
Alright here we go, three two one. (crunching)

445
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,486
Aw brain freeze, brain freeze, brain freeze, aw man.
