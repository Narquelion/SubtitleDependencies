00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:01,629
- What's up everyone, it is Collins Key

2
00:00:01,629 --> 00:00:03,527
and welcome to Magic Mondays.

3
00:00:03,527 --> 00:00:04,432
So every week I ask you guys

4
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:06,701
to comment with the name of your favorite Youtuber

5
00:00:06,701 --> 00:00:08,002
and then I'll do magic for them.

6
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:09,192
And as I'm looking through the comments

7
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:12,056
one of the most requested Youtubers is Zoella.

8
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:14,808
So basically I did some cheeky magic for her.

9
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:15,641
Check it out.

10
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,542
- I'm here with Collins who is

11
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:18,727
- Yo, what's up guys?

12
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,835
- A big time magician.

13
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:21,269
- [Collins] So what's your favorite card?

14
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:22,143
- Queen of Hearts.

15
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:22,976
- [Collins] Queen of Hearts?

16
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:23,809
Alright.

17
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:25,120
Actually here, you know what, that's too obvious.

18
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,897
Just touch a card, any card you want.

19
00:00:26,897 --> 00:00:28,779
Just touch one.

20
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,362
That one, are you sure?

21
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:31,195
- Yes.

22
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:35,993
- [Collins] Okay, you got the Sharpie right?

23
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:38,532
Just on the card for us.

24
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:40,381
- [Crowd Member] That card's now worth a million dollars.

25
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,894
- [Girl] Yeah! Let's sell it.

26
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:43,408
(laughs)

27
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:44,882
- Okay perfect, I'm going to keep that card forever.

28
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:45,799
Okay watch.

29
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:49,226
You think it should be dry enough?

30
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:50,276
- [Crowd Member] Is it dry?

31
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:51,940
- [Collins] Yeah feel it, it doesn't come off or anything.

32
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,607
Alright, here we go.

33
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,121
Okay, you're gonna fold it up.

34
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:00,929
Can you open up your mouth for us?

35
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,533
Just bite down on the card.

36
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:03,520
Like that, here we go.

37
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,606
And now, I'll use my own card alright.

38
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,301
Let's see here.

39
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:08,150
Can I see the Sharpie?

40
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,958
I'm going to do my own signature here on the King.

41
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,375
(rock music)

42
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:18,268
On the King, alright, this'll be mine.

43
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:19,484
You've got your card, I've got mine, alright.

44
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:23,002
Just keep it right there, keep it right there.

45
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:23,977
Alright, here we go, watch.

46
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:25,144
Take the King.

47
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:30,954
I'm just going to fold up the King.

48
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:33,838
Alright, you ready?

49
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:36,755
- [Crowd Member] You're so nervous.

50
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:47,188
- Keep your card where it is, check it out.

51
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:49,447
If I open up my King.

52
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:51,697

53
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:55,872
Film it, film it.

- Oh my god, that is amazing.

57
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:02,901

61
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:08,830
- What the hell?

62
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,847
Was I unconscious or something?

63
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:11,987
