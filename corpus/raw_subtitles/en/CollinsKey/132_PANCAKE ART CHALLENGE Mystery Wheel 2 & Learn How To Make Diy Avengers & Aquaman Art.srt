1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,430
- [Both] Three, two, one... ohh.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,800
- [Devan] That looks so good.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,330
- You challenged us to make Lego characters,

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,490
so right now let's go.

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,610
For my pancake, I'm going to make the Flash.

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,800
- And I'm making Spiderman.

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,210
- Start off a little bit differently.

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,720
I'm gonna start off with a square body.

9
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,010
Here we go, we're just gonna give his little leg.

10
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,843
Just like that, look at that,

11
00:00:15,843 --> 00:00:17,520
look at that perfect little leg right there, man.

12
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,810
Alright, next up we gotta give him a neck.

13
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm gonna give him a little bit of a longer neck

14
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,113
just to, you know, make up for

15
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:23,210
the fact that his body is so small.

16
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,910
Alright, and there we oops.

17
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,410
And we'll give him his little arms over here.

18
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,920
Next up, I gotta do his lightening belt,

19
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,380
but for some reason I don't have the color yellow.

20
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,690
Oh right, I left it in the kitchen.

21
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,308
So, let me grab that really quick, here we go.

22
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:33,460
(speed noise)

23
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,920
Alright, got the yellow, perfect.

24
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,210
Ah, no, I need the bigger yellow,

25
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,850
so give me one second, I'll be right back.

26
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,115
We'll place this over here, here we go.

27
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:40,450
(speed noise)

28
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,410
Alright, I got the bigger yellow.

29
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,243
- What are you doing?

30
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,080
- I'm grabbing the other yellow.

31
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,913
- Where did you just go?

32
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:47,160
Dude, are my eyes playing tricks on me, or what?

33
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,330
- So, his belt's all like jaggedy lightening type,

34
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,150
so we're gonna go like this. It looks more like a ruffle.

35
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,410
Now we're gonna fill it in with yellow.

36
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,100
Alright we gotta give him his eyeballs next,

37
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,610
so we got eyeball number one over here,

38
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,260
and now the important part, time to give him his red mask.

39
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,930
Here we go, his red mask kinda goes like this,

40
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,460
circles out around the eyes.

41
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,620
My dude apparently looks like Charlie Brown

42
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,930
mixed with Wall-e, man.

43
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,420
- Whoa, he totally does.

44
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,970
- Yeah, this is not as good as I thought it was going to be,

45
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,348
but, at the same time, it's great.

46
00:01:09,348 --> 00:01:10,460
Alright, we're gonna give him a little mouth.

47
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,831
He's gonna be like, "Yeah, what's up?"

48
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:12,880
He's like (yells).

49
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,833
- He went (yells)

50
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,840
- This is what happens when he's running super fast.

51
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,870
Alright, the most important part,

52
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,280
the lightening bolt on his chest.

53
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,520
Let's do this.

54
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,180
I need a real life example of a lightening bolt,

55
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,490
so time to forge a lightening bolt.

56
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,700
So, let's see, okay.

57
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,960
I think that should be good.

58
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,232
Here we go, let's see, three, two, one.

59
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:31,060
(yelling)

60
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,620
- Did that even help you at all?

61
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,790
- I actually forgot what it looks like,

62
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,620
so I guess I'll just have to just kind of wing it.

63
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,453
- Seriously?

64
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:38,998
(upbeat music)

65
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,210
- Alright, now we gotta fill in his neck,

66
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,340
Gotta give him a nice good...

67
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,450
Oh no, it's Hoot-Dini! - Seriously?

68
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,740
- The owl that randomly goes off

69
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,730
which means we need to spin for our wild card.

70
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,322
Three, two, one. You know what, I just really hope

71
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,520
that it doesn't mess up my lightening bolt

72
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,240
because I gotta really make this guy perfect.

73
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,730
- What, salad tong flip?

74
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,680
- No, I got batter hands.

75
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,580
- Ohh.

76
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,590
- Alright, well we got the batter.

77
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,423
I've got some hands, and time to have some batter hands.

78
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,720
Here we go, batter hand number one.

79
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,890
Let's go get the second in.

80
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,620
First up, we're gonna make the lightening bolt on his chest.

81
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,400
He has a circle first that goes around his chest like that.

82
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,066
There we go. Dude, I'm gonna get artistic and creative here.

83
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,390
I'm just gonna drop,

84
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,407
Ah man, that's not gonna work.

85
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:18,346
And now to finish up, just gotta add the red.

86
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,418
Alright, just gonna finish off the... oh no.

87
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:21,251
- What happened?

88
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:22,780
- The batter's like so slippery, man.

89
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,613
It just slipped right out of my hand.

90
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:25,420
Just gonna do it like, okay.

91
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,347
Nooo! It took off half his lightening bolt.

92
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,220
What if I just use this, just clear

93
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,350
a little path her in the middle.

94
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,692
I'm gonna redo his lightening bolt.

95
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:34,390
(upbeat music)

96
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,570
- Alright, time to go for the...

97
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,931
Wait, I can't use a spatula to flip it.

98
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:38,764
- Ohh. - Man.

99
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:40,650
- You have to use the tongs. What a technique, man.

100
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,640
- Yeah, you can see I embrace the batter hands.

101
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,700
You try to stay away from them.

102
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,533
I'm embracing them.

103
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:45,710
I think they're actually gonna help out artwork.

104
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,040
Alright, now it's time for the flip.

105
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,050
So, luckily for me, I get to use some spatulas.

106
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,022
- I know, so jealous right now.

107
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:52,070
- Oh god, my pants.

108
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,913
- [Both] Three, two, one.

109
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,950
- Oh my gosh, I did it with finesse.

110
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,640
That's pretty cool.

111
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,473
- You ready for this?

112
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:01,490
- Yup, I'm totally ready.

113
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,070
- You have to tong it so lightly.

114
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,580
Three, two...

115
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,980
- Wait, five second subscribe challenge.

116
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,720
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

117
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,570
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

118
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,730
Are you ready, here we go.

119
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,650
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done.

120
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,850
- If you could do that, comment down below

121
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,140
'keyper squad' right now.

122
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,830
- Alright, here we go, ready, set, go.

123
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,780
- Be careful.

124
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,613
(yells)

125
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:24,880
Oh no, but that looks good.

126
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,890
You get to comment down below,

127
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,420
who made a better pancake, and right now,

128
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,660
we're on to the next one.

129
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,060
You challenged us to make Captain America

130
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,610
from Avengers: Endgame, so right now, let's go.

131
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,270
I'm gonna make Captain America's shield first

132
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,555
because it's the most iconic part.

133
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:37,660
- Dude, I'm doing the same. - A perfect circle.

134
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,300
That's, Devan okay, the second

135
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,310
circle was actually pretty solid.

136
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,410
You wanna take a look at it?

137
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,430
Hey, Devan, look at my circle.

138
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,600
- I'm making an oval.

139
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,580
- That's a pretty good circle, right?

140
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,480
- Yeah, that's really good.

141
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,490
- And in the Marvel movies, his shield is indestructible,

142
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,870
so I wonder if the pancake is

143
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,940
going to be indestructible, as well,

144
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,773
so we're gonna turn this up,

145
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,570
and we're gonna roast it, flip it, and test the pancake,

146
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,150
and then we're gonna continue with the rest of the body.

147
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,983
- Wait, what?

148
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:55,920
How does that make sense?

149
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,230
- Maybe I have vibranium pancake batter, Devan.

150
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,130
Never thought of that did ya?

151
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,280
- Nope, very unlikely.

152
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,192
- Alright, here we go.

153
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:02,025
It's a little jiggly.

154
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:03,891
Doesn't look too indestructible right now. (yells)

155
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:04,724
- What?

156
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:05,630
- It's not feeling indestructible.

157
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,730
Three, two, one, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

158
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,160
Let's just flip the (yells)

159
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,570
Okay, together, alright, well maybe

160
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,070
this needs to cook and harden.

161
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:15,600
(upbeat music)

162
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,440
I'm gonna try to repair the shield.

163
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,900
So, I'm gonna add some extra batter in here.

164
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,440
Hopefully, this will seal the different parts together.

165
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,120
Let's see how strong this pancake shield really is.

166
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,380
Here we go, three, two, one.

167
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,213
(metal clank)

168
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:28,650
- Ohh what?

169
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,770
That sounded like it hurt.

170
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,725
- Oh, yeah.

171
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:31,558
(metal clanking)

172
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:33,583
Ow, that's a strong pancake.

173
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,416
(metal clank)

174
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,450
That's a no for me.

175
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,750
- Oh no, the cap came off.

176
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,872
- Oh that's not good.

177
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:42,180
- Ohh, he's gonna have a blob arm.

178
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,420
- He has a loaf of bread for a head.

179
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,029
That's just kind of Captain America's deal.

180
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:45,862
- A baguette.

181
00:04:45,862 --> 00:04:47,610
Dude, I'm not sure how good my shield is looking.

182
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,700
I mean it's not that close to the real one.

183
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,557
What do you think?

184
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,830
- Wait, that's the real Captain America shield?

185
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,350
- Yeah, I mean there's only one.

186
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,690
- No like, that's like the real one?

187
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,850
- Yeah, it's vibranium.

188
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,770
It's indestructible, bro.

189
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,790
- You wanna test it?

190
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,640
- Uh, yeah, sure.

191
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,720
- Alright, here we go, you ready?

192
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,584
- Uh, yeah. - Three, two...

193
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:05,740
- Whoa. - What?

194
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,530
- You're going a little quick, let me just get it.

195
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,440
Okay, alright, go.

196
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,790
- And you're sure that's the real one?

197
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,660
- Uh, yeah.

198
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,283
- Okay, here we go, three, two, one.

199
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:17,533
(blasting and yelling)

200
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:20,265
Whoa.

201
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,098
- Dude.

202
00:05:21,098 --> 00:05:22,467
- That is definitely the real shield.

203
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,920
- Um, yeah it is.

204
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,138
Didn't I tell ya?

205
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:27,160
(whoosh)

206
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,030
- You were supposed to catch it.

207
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,696
It was coming back to you. - Oh, he has new.

208
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,010
- I'm gonna fill in Captain America's star with red.

209
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,480
Next up, I gotta give him the American torso suspenders.

210
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,570
I don't know, we have like the red and white

211
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,690
across the side.

212
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,600
- We're doing that next.

213
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,800
Now it's time to Captain America the mouth of a hero.

214
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,970
- Doesn't that just look like a mouth?

215
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,890
- It looks like this Devan. The mouth of a hero.

216
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,556
- Yup. - Oh no, I just remembered.

217
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:47,340
When I flip my pancake, this is gonna become burnt side up.

218
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,265
- Oh no.

219
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,117
- That's horrible.

220
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,033
And now it's time to fill in his hero mouth.

221
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:52,220
Just gonna put the...

222
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,127
Oh no, Hoot-Dini. - What, really?

223
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:55,660
- Alright we gotta spin for our wild card,

224
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,860
bro, this is not gonna be good.

225
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,200
- [Both] Three, two, one.

226
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,033
- Oh, what happened?

227
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,270
- It just popped right off.

228
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,810
Well, it's part of the mystery wheel.

229
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,160
I don't have to get that one, so hopefully

230
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,060
that was not a bad one, so let's see what this is.

231
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,680
- Super acrylic nails?

232
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,513
- What?

233
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:09,346
- What's the difference between

234
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:11,010
regular acrylic and super acrylic?

235
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,410
- Alright, I got a bag with batter,

236
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,540
so I don't know really what I do with that, but I...

237
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,646
Oh no - What?

238
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:16,810
- That means I can't use these containers.

239
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,772
I can only use the bag.

240
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:18,740
- Oh no.

241
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,693
- I probably like poke holes in it.

242
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:21,040
Alright, well right now let's go,

243
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,290
- So, this is what super acrylic nails meant.

244
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,940
Wow, I know what acrylic nails are,

245
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,450
but these are definitely super.

246
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,410
- Yeah, and I guess I have to use this bag.

247
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,810
So, I'm gonna have like just poke holes in it

248
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,944
and properly dispense it.

249
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:31,777
- How do I...

250
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:32,930
Oh, one already broke off.

251
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,150
How am I gonna pick this up

252
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,691
'cause I can't pick it up like this.

253
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:38,380
Oh man, oh man.

254
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,580
Oh no, I forgot I have to turn on the thing first.

255
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,790
- Oh yeah, here, oh that's gonna be tough.

256
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,623
(yells)

257
00:06:43,623 --> 00:06:45,680
Be careful, they'll be, how are you gonna turn it on?

258
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,820
Devan's going for like an upside down, like okay.

259
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,030
- I think I got it, I think I got it.

260
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,797
It's the side of the thumb. - As you're doing that,

261
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:53,930
- Did it turn on? - time to poke my first hole.

262
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,763
- Oh yeah, it's on, it's hot.

263
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:56,940
It's on, it's on, it's on. Okay, okay.

264
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,773
- I gotta...

265
00:06:57,773 --> 00:06:58,606
- Oh!

266
00:06:58,606 --> 00:06:59,439
- Sorry, I bumped you.

267
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,272
Alright, hole's in.

268
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:01,580
Just gonna squeeze out.

269
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,143
Oh, this is actually pretty cool, man.

270
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:03,976
- Oh no.

271
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:05,500
- I wonder if I can be doing like two holes at once

272
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,660
like dispensing twice as much.

273
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,560
Yes.

274
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,120
- Okay, gotta pick this, gotta get this one, uh huh.

275
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,410
- I'm absolutely crushing it right now.

276
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,250
- Hello, there we go, I think I got it, I think I got it.

277
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,440
Nice and careful, okay, got it here, switch grip.

278
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,574
- Running out of batter quickly.

279
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,677
- Now it's time to fill in the rest of this.

280
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:24,120
- You gotta squeeze harder, man.

281
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,110
- What, how?

282
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,260
It's not that I'm not trying.

283
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,490
This is gonna ruin my pancake.

284
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,640
I don't like that.

285
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,070
Gonna take on the shoe and the arm at the same time.

286
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,000
- Oh come on.

287
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,846
- Oh boy, I messed this up, I messed this up,

288
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:34,889
(yelling) I messed it up.

289
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,460
And just like that, it's over.

290
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,530
- Oh, it's gonna take forever.

291
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,480
Bro, this is like a pincher workout, man.

292
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,313
- Pincher workout?

293
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:43,510
- Just these two fingers pinchin', ahh.

294
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,284
Muscles are starting to feel some fatigue.

295
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:47,180
- Fatigue. I have an idea, why don't you use

296
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,570
these as little like funnel shoots,

297
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,200
and so you pour the pancake batter

298
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,700
in at the top and let it funnel down.

299
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,580
- See, that sounds like something you would do,

300
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,862
and it wouldn't be effective.

301
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:55,695
- What?

302
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:57,070
Alright, here we go, I'm just gonna dispense down here.

303
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,510
- Oh, I gotta support with my other nail, oh.

304
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,340
Dude, it's like one of those cement trucks.

305
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,810
No way, it is actually working.

306
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,760
- Yeah, I kept...

307
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,740
- (shouting) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, carefully.

308
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,810
- Okay, I'm gonna stop now.

309
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,957
- Oh, you made this so much more difficult.

310
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,666
Now I don't know what to do with this nail, bro.

311
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,502
You compromised it.

312
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:14,383
- What do you mean compromised it? It looks great.

313
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:16,400
It's red on the outside, blue on the inside, that's unique.

314
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,313
- Never again. - Well, look at the top.

315
00:08:18,313 --> 00:08:19,290
- Look at, my finger!

316
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,980
- I'm sorry about that. I just wanna help out that...

317
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,490
- Whoa, whoa, whoa no, nope.

318
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,620
Alright, here we go.

319
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,550
Palm technique, and now I have to move onto the pancake.

320
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,940
Wow, that actually works.

321
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,280
- Yeah, that was actually pretty good.

322
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,850
- [Devan] Look at this, it's speedy Devan.

323
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,683
- Speedy Devan.

324
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:32,810
He's looking kinda blobby right now,

325
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,360
not too muscly I must say.

326
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,193
- [Devan] And done.

327
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:36,026
- I didn't even think about this,

328
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:37,840
but how are you gonna flip with those acrylic nails.

329
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,380
- Oh, what?

330
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,790
Alright, it's on and roasting.

331
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,610
- Maybe use your nails to flip it.

332
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,443
- No way, dude.

333
00:08:43,443 --> 00:08:44,860
I'm gonna break off all my nails.

334
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,940
- Alright, here we go, time to flip my Captain America.

335
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,773
- Oh, go for it.

336
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:52,070
- [Both] Three, two, one... oh.

337
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,940
- [Devan] That is one burnt pancake.

338
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,540
- Yeah, but I mean like it still is recognizable.

339
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,880
- Let me get that bit for ya.

340
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,810
Let me just get that bit there, just gotta scoop it up.

341
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,920
- There we go, okay, perfect. - I got it, there we go.

342
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,200
- I must admit, the shield looks

343
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,830
way better from the other angle.

344
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,580
- Just the palm grip, oh, yup.

345
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,460
Just the palm and a little bit of pinky.

346
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,700
Here we go, coming underneath.

347
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,480
I feel like an eagle flying in for the scoop, you know.

348
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,880
This is actually doing pretty well.

349
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,713
Alright, the flip.

350
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:14,690
Three, two, one...

351
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,520
- Oh, if you wanna win a 15 minute

352
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
video call with Devan and I,

353
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,520
text the word "art" to 81800 right now.

354
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,930
So, pause the video, text the word art to 81800,

355
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,550
and you'll automatically be entered in to win,

356
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,940
and right now, let's see how this looks.

357
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,609
- Alright, ready, set, go.

358
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,986
- [Collins] Oh, that looks so good.

359
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,650
- [Devan] And I lost a pinky in the process.

360
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,340
- How did you make that with the nails, bro.

361
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,173
Oh my gosh.

362
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,530
Alright, you give the comment down below

363
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,910
who won this round, right now, we're onto the next one.

364
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,510
You challenged us to make a dragon from

365
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,729
How to Train Your Dragon, so right now, let's go.

366
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,430
- Alright, I'm starting with the eye, how 'bout you Collins?

367
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,440
- I'm gonna start with the wings.

368
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,273
- Alright.

369
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:46,640
- So, we got wing number one, and then

370
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,230
we got the other side of the wing.

371
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,500
Bam, and there is the base of my dragon.

372
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,580
That's actually pretty good.

373
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,430
Like that was pretty solid.

374
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,930
- Dude, I feel like you've done that head like three times.

375
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,577
- I always run out of room at the top.

376
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:57,410
Oh, that's gonna be supper cool.

377
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,870
He's gonna have like awesome little wings.

378
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,640
- I don't have enough room for the top of his horn,

379
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,990
so it's just gonna be a little stump.

380
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,750
- There is actually precise art to adding the

381
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,570
right amount of pancake batter like that.

382
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,580
- Bam, wing number one complete.

383
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,431
- Nicely done.

384
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:11,710
(upbeat music)

385
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,070
- Now it's time to add some upgrades to my dragon's wings,

386
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,030
so we're just gonna add this...

387
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,360
Oh no, Hoot-Dini.

388
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,645
- Oh, I was on the scales and everything.

389
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:19,010
- Oh, dude, and you're like pretty early on,

390
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,274
so this could really mess you up right now.

391
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:21,107
- I know.

392
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:23,330
- [Both] Three, two, one.

393
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,100
- Have we ever gotten something good yet?

394
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,150
- I don't think we have.

395
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,930
- Alright, well let's hope this one changes that pattern,

396
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,871
so let's see what I got.

397
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:30,670
- (yells) No, dude, I got duct tape.

398
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,190
- Well, I got can't bend elbows.

399
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,447
- Bro, I have like dinosaur dragon arms right now.

400
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:37,650
- And I have like Frankenstein arms, dude.

401
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,920
- Well, it'll be very interesting to see how

402
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,420
this pancake turns out, and right now,

403
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,691
I need to continue with the designs.

404
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:42,524
- I don't know.

405
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:43,357
- So, the first step, I'm gonna pick up this one over here.

406
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:44,550
- Gonna grab this.

407
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,250
- I got it, and then you gotta kinda go

408
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,040
forward like this, extend the fingers.

409
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,570
- I can't relax any arm.

410
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,610
How is yours going?

411
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,000
- I put the eye in the wrong place, hold up.

412
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,280
- I keep on just dripping everywhere.

413
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,680
- Devan, can I borrow your sleeve?

414
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,513
- My what?

415
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:56,800
- I need to use your sleeve to wipe up some batter.

416
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,633
- What?

417
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,440
You can't use my sleeve, that's my merch, bro.

418
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,273
- Oh, alright.

419
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:02,430
(upbeat music)

420
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,750
Alright, we got some paper towel here.

421
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,930
How does yours still look so good

422
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,490
when you can't even bend your elbows?

423
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,595
- To be honest, I don't know.

424
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:08,901
- [Collins] Alright, here we go, we just gotta dab it up.

425
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,170
- Alright, time to add some scales.

426
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,100
They're going well.

427
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,110
- For a second I thought you meant like scale

428
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,430
like you're gonna try to weigh 'em.

429
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,263
- The what?

430
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:17,510
Okay, I think I'm done, but now I have to sneeze, oh no.

431
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,900
- Dude, you better cover your mouth, man.

432
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,550
If you don't cover your mouth, there's gonna be a big issue.

433
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,383
- I don't know how.

434
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:22,216
- What do you mean you don't know how?

435
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:23,330
- I might need to use your shoulder.

436
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,400
- You can't, dat won't happen.

437
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,910
- Well luckily I don't have to sneeze anymore,

438
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,160
so your shoulder has been spared.

439
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,993
You're welcome.

440
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:29,950
- Let me return the favor.

441
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,300
- Oh, thank you, okay.

442
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,133
- Hug me brother!

443
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,370
- Oh, okay, alright, here we go.

444
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,291
It's more like a crocodile hug.

445
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,617
What is, what are you doing with your hand?

446
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:37,750
- Trying to hug something.

447
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,690
- Well, I think I need to turn on the hot plate, sorry.

448
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry, did I bump you?

449
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,410
- You did, but I don't complain.

450
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,630
- Okay, hot plate on.

451
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,150
Time to shake up the bottle.

452
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,620
I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job.

453
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,790
Gotta prepare me red.

454
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,623
- Me red.

455
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:52,940
- This is some risky business.

456
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,115
- Ah, so close.

457
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:54,948
- Oh, dear.

458
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:55,980
- Oh, I got it. - Oh, dear.

459
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,970
- [Collins] There we go, a little tongue in the middle

460
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,857
of his mouth, that's perfect.

461
00:11:57,857 --> 00:12:01,380
- Oh, this take max concentration and a lot of arm strength.

462
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,260
- [Collins] For this row of scales,

463
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,550
they're gonna be a little bit unconventional.

464
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,990
- Okay, I'm done with the blue.

465
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,810
Time to go for the eye.

466
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,643
- Perfect.

467
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,476
- Alright, nice.

468
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:09,960
- You know what, I'm kinda at a loss for what to do next,

469
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,340
so I need some real like dragon inspiration right now.

470
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,242
So, I'm gonna call my pet dragon, Doug.

471
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:15,526
(whistles)

472
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,466
(dragon flying)

473
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:18,248
Here he comes, here he comes.

474
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:19,540
Oh, that was so cool.

475
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,561
- Collins, Collins, Collins, Doug, look at Doug.

476
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,144
- Oh my gosh, Doug!

477
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,333
- Well, I guess we'll continue to roast some pancakes.

478
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,170
Pancake batter work.

479
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,003
Why don't you work?

480
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:32,480
- Alright, here we go, I'm gonna turn it on now.

481
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,460
Okay, so this is now where I have to be very careful

482
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,880
because I cannot get close to the griddle.

483
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,713
This is super important.

484
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,610
First steps first, I gotta add some more details.

485
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,200
So, this leg over here is gonna be full of detail.

486
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,714
Alright, now we'll give him some waffle wings.

487
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:43,220
Pew, waffle wing.

488
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,720
- [Devan] Dude, I think I've gotten the hang of this, man.

489
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,553
- Waffle wing.

490
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:46,880
- I'm gonna do double straight arms.

491
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,713
- Wow.

492
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:49,007
- Look at that.

493
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:49,980
Maybe I should not.

494
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,380
- Alright, now I'm just gonna grab the green again

495
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,970
because I need it for...

496
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,880
Oh, I little bit of misfire, here we go.

497
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,040
So, let's get the green on.

498
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,170
It's very difficult to be precise

499
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,003
when your hands are stuck like this.

500
00:12:58,003 --> 00:13:00,030
Little bit there on the tip of the wing, alright perfect.

501
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,863
- Ohh.

502
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,740
- As you can see, without duct tape, with duct tape.

503
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,498
It makes a huge difference.

504
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:07,800
(upbeat music)

505
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,190
Imagine how all this detail's gonna look.

506
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,023
It's gonna be fantastic. - I'm done!

507
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:10,930
- Wait you're done?

508
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,060
- Yup, I get to rest my arms now.

509
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,800
- Alright, I gotta try to get the white,

510
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,470
so, I'm gonna use this little spatula to pick it up.

511
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,588
- Nice, it's a spatula not a grabber, Collins, ohh.

512
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:19,421
- It didn't work.

513
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:20,440
- You know what, I'll give you my white.

514
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,306
- Oh, thank you, that's very kind.

515
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:22,230
- There you go.

516
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,310
Oh, okay.

517
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,130
Careful, dude, careful, I got it.

518
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,430
Here's the white. - I don't need the white.

519
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,263
- You don't need the white now?

520
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:28,096
- I need the yellow.

521
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:28,929
- Really, I just got you the white.

522
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:30,380
- Devan, I'm an artist, and I need a yellow.

523
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,690
- Fine, here you go.

524
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,580
Here is your yellow.

525
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,330
- Thank you, alright here we go, same process.

526
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,780
Yup, uh-huh, nice.

527
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,090
Here we go, long shot.

528
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,540
- Dude, it's on max heat.

529
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,364
It's like cooking it right away.

530
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:43,340
- Alright, I got it, I'll turn it off.

531
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,723
Careful, be careful, and that's it.

532
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:46,900
I complete my dragon.

533
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,020
Alright, now I'll just let it cook.

534
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,510
Well, I think it's actually almost already cooked.

535
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,600
- Yeah, that's what happens when you're on max heat, bro.

536
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,280
- Devan, can you please hand me that spatula over there.

537
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,524
- Yes, I got you brother.

538
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:56,090
- Thank you, just put it in my hands, thank you.

539
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:56,923
- You're welcome.

540
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:57,790
Do you need another spatula?

541
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,170
- Nope, one's, uh oh, I already prematurely flipped it.

542
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,140
- Ohh, I feel like the flip for you

543
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,170
is gonna be really difficult.

544
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,626
- Here we go, three, two, one.

545
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:06,857
- (yells) Yes, I got it.

546
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:08,520
- That's a pretty great dragon.

547
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,650
- I am a master flipper bro.

548
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,040
- Didn't know until today, but, yup,

549
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,260
you definitely passed the exams.

550
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,150
I needed that spatula.

551
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,590
- Oh, sorry, it fell off the table.

552
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,280
I would get it for you, but again, small hands.

553
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,269
- Time to grab my spatulas.

554
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:20,102
- You got this, Devan.

555
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:21,060
- Try to get some of it off.

556
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,450
- It doesn't look cooked all the way through.

557
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,140
- Some of it is, but some of it isn't.

558
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,820
- I can only offer moral support

559
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,280
because my arms don't reach that far.

560
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,980
I can wave over here and give you little golf claps.

561
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,850
You got this Devan, you got this, bro.

562
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,501
- Thank you, I actually really appreciate that.

563
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:35,167
- Hoorah. - [Devan] You ready for this?

564
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,750
- I don't want to say this, Devan, but I don't quite

565
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,630
have confidence you'll be able to do this successfully.

566
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,463
- Really?

567
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:40,296
- I just need to put it out there.

568
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,653
- Alright, well I have confidence in me, so should you.

569
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:44,520
- I do now.

570
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,560
- Ready, set...

571
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,410
- That looks so good.

572
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,680
- Go, no!

573
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,020
- Wait is is stuck?

574
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,713
Get your, it's so bad, oh no. I can't even look, oh man.

575
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:55,130
- There we go, I fixed it, yay.

576
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,570
There it is.

577
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,660
(clapping)

578
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,080
- Ayy, alright.

579
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,030
- You get to comment down below and let us know who made

580
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,300
the best pancake, right now, it's on to the next one.

581
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,550
You challenged us to make Mera from the new Aquaman movie,

582
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,820
so right now, let's go.

583
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,410
I'm starting off by making the crown,

584
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,287
so we have like one peak here. - Hey, same.

585
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:11,380
Are you copying me?

586
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,267
I'm gonna hide my work.

587
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:13,100
- [Collins] Here, we got a peak like this.

588
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,460
- [Devan] That's a large crown.

589
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,293
- Now I'm gonna do the head.

590
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:16,520
Looks kinda like a cowboy right now.

591
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,910
Alright, we'll turn this on,

592
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,770
and then we'll give her some ears.

593
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,470
Next up, we got the eyebrows, and she's got great eyebrows.

594
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,770
Devan, those look pretty great, right?

595
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,950
- Yeah, those are actually really nice.

596
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,290
- Yeah, those are phenomenal eyebrows.

597
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,130
We'll give her two eyeballs.

598
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,910
We'll give her one right there, one over here.

599
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,290
Now, we gotta give her a beautiful smile, look at that.

600
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,580
Look, she's so happy.

601
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,400
Alright, we'll give her a little tongue right here.

602
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,240
Oh, a light gray inside the mouth.

603
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,010
You know, give like depth, and shadows right?

604
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,040
- Shadows and all that great art things.

605
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,620
- The inside of the mouth isn't gray though.

606
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,453
- What should it be?

607
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:43,286
- It would be a darker red.

608
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:45,160
- Fortunately, I have a darker red right here.

609
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,290
So, I guess she's gonna have gray molars.

610
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,370
Alright, then we give her a darker red in her mouth.

611
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,056
Oh, wow, Devan you're really good at this.

612
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:52,390
(thunder)

613
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,343
- Whoa.

614
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:56,000
(electric buzzing)

615
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,070
Whoa, you okay?

616
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,130
- Yeah, well you know what they say, right?

617
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,910
Luckily, lightening doesn't strike twice.

618
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,743
- Yeah.

619
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:01,880
Whoa.

620
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,970
The shortest storm ever.

621
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,760
- Now it is time to fill in the golden crown,

622
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,220
so, oh, I have an idea.

623
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,840
Devan, I'm gonna get an advantage on you right now.

624
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,593
I'm going to create an emerald gem in the middle of it.

625
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,760
Well, I just kinda told you what

626
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,593
my advantage would be but there you go.

627
00:16:11,593 --> 00:16:12,970
- You know what I'm gonna do?

628
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,730
I'm gonna add an emerald gem in the middle of it, yes.

629
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,790
- I literally just had that idea.

630
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,623
- Oh, really?

631
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:18,456
- I think the thing about the gem,

632
00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:22,150
it's very unusual looking, and a ruby in the center.

633
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,480
Alright, now time for the gold crown to be made.

634
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,921
So, we're gonna add the yellow in.

635
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:27,960
I'm just gonna add in the eyeballs.

636
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,590
Mine's coming along really well right now.

637
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,440
Now for the ears, I see Devan has those small line details,

638
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,030
so I'm gonna try to emulate the same thing.

639
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,863
For the difference, I don't really

640
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,130
know what lines the ear needs.

641
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,980
- Just look at my ears for reference.

642
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,430
Yeah, that is there.

643
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,210
- I saw that, and I'm now and artist.

644
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,530
The thing is she's got red ears

645
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,090
because she recently got embarrassed.

646
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,620
Like something happened, and she got embarrassed,

647
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,600
and so her ears turned red.

648
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,580
And now, the final step, time for the hair.

649
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,720
So, we're gonna fill this in first.

650
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,539
It's time to start roasting my pancake.

651
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:56,580
(laughs) It looks so good.

652
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,413
Proud of me.

653
00:16:57,413 --> 00:16:58,300
Time to flip my pancake,

654
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,570
and this is gonna be so challenging.

655
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,990
Like this is one of the largest pancakes I've ever made.

656
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,140
- Dude, how are you gonna do this?

657
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,233
- [Both] Three, two, one, oh.

658
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,110
- [Collins] A perfect flip.

659
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,880
- Dude, nice job. - This is pretty phenomenal.

660
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,713
Thank you, man, alright.

661
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:11,220
- Whoa, that was a weak high five, bro.

662
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
- Oh, sorry.

663
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,580
- Alright, it's time to flip mine.

664
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,765
Three, two, one...

665
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:15,760
- We're doing three second like challenge.

666
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,150
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.

667
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,100
You ready, here we go.

668
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,870
- [Both] Three, two, one, done.

669
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,327
- Ready, set, go.

670
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:25,141
- [Both] What?

671
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:26,580
- I only had a couple hairs fall off.

672
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,330
- [Collins] And only a couple hairs fell off.

673
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,380
- You get to comment down below who made a better Mera.

674
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,950
Right now, we're on to the next one.

675
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,120
You challenged us to make Simba from the Lion King.

676
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,370
I'm gonna start in a very different way.

677
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,790
I'm gonna begin with his ear.

678
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,040
Alright, so the two ears are done.

679
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,050
The thing about his ears is he has

680
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,950
this kinda like lining on the inside, oh.

681
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,930
You've heard of the circle of life.

682
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,120
This is the circle of Simba's ears.

683
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,734
This one over here we'll start with a super curly ear here.

684
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,187
Wait, are you making Simba or Yoda right now.

685
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:50,450
- No, I'm making Simba, bro. - That looks like Yoda to me.

686
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,500
That's Yoda's ear.

687
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,016
Just gotta add in the color.

688
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:55,599
(upbeat music)

689
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,900
And now, the most important part.

690
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,724
Time to make his full head, oh, face, face?

691
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:00,910
There's his face.

692
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,570
Alright, just gonna fill in his hair.

693
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,473
Oh no, Hoot-Dini. That means we gotta spin the

694
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:06,910
mystery wheel for our wild card.

695
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,772
You ready? - Yup.

696
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:10,330
- Here we go, three, two, one. - I'm hoping I get red.

697
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,520
I don't know why, I just want red.

698
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,020
Oh, I was so close to red.

699
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,650
- Oh no, what does yours say?

700
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,040
- What, upside down pancake.

701
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,157
- I have to use grabber hands to make the rest.

702
00:18:17,157 --> 00:18:18,654
Like I can't use my hands.

703
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:20,149
- Nooo, what?

704
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:21,250
- Alright, got my little grabber hands.

705
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,650
- I can't believe it's turned upside down.

706
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,020
This mouth might look really wack.

707
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,330
- At least you have like regular hands.

708
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,490
I have to use these little grabber things.

709
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,720
- They look like little duck bills.

710
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,380
You know I've actually done exercises like this in art, so.

711
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,780
Yours is almost more interfering

712
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,920
with me than it is with you.

713
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,820
- I gotta scoot over here for one second.

714
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,708
- Really, bro?

715
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,325
- Maybe I just need to get the bigger one, here we go.

716
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,160
Oopsie.

717
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,530
Alright, here we go, gonna bring it over here like this.

718
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,720
Okay, there we go, lift.

719
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,553
- Grab.

720
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:43,750
- It's so unnecessarily long.

721
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,826
I gotta like scoot my chair back a little bit. (yells)

722
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,930
(upbeat music)

723
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,190
See it shaking, bro, it's just like.

724
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,420
- I see it, I can definitely see.

725
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,897
- Ah, support from the bottom, regrip.

726
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:56,010
- Whoa.

727
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,930
- I'm gonna put down one of these.

728
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,120
I'm only gonna use one at a time.

729
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,160
Pick it up, squeeze, there we go.

730
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,120
Wait, how are you so good even upside down, man.

731
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,400
Like I can't even figure this out regular way.

732
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,610
- These are actually exercises I've done before.

733
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,443
- What kind of workout has you

734
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:07,640
doing pancake art upside down?

735
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,000
- No, art exercise, Collins.

736
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,440
- This is so slow.

737
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,590
I don't like it.

738
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,910
I need to get some different claws.

739
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,130
Alright, I got some new grabby hands,

740
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,810
and these might actually be even worse.

741
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,780
There is like no way I can finish my pancake

742
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,530
'cause these grabby hands are all so bad.

743
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,540
I gotta control myself.

744
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,059
Unfortunately, I gotta go back to the big grabby hands.

745
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:26,210
Alright, here we go, lift, ah, c'mon!

746
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,688
Now I just gotta pick up the gray.

747
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:28,620
(dripping)

748
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,453
No!

749
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:30,286
- Oh.

750
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:31,370
- Oh, there we go, see if I push...

751
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,203
Oh, I broke it.

752
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:33,300
Gather a little bit up right here,

753
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,500
and then build the circle of the eye.

754
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,140
Alright, last thing I gotta do is just fill it all in.

755
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,640
I actually have quite a sophisticated plan.

756
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,530
We're gonna use a grabber hand thing, grab and grip.

757
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,980
Now I'm gonna lift it up like this and then spin.

758
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,300
Oh, I have a solution.

759
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,720
Gonna take this one here, and use this one

760
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,350
to just hold it in place, and then use this one

761
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,710
to push down and dispense the red, oh man.

762
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,480
- You just messed up his eye.

763
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,790
- [Collins] Yeah, it's ruining kind of a

764
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,260
lots of different parts of it right now.

765
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,930
- Dude, mine is so close to being done.

766
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,157
Please do not mess it up.

767
00:19:58,157 --> 00:20:00,740
(upbeat music)

768
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:05,740
- Alright, we're gonna push it up over here.

769
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,430
There we go, look at those long shots.

770
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,092
Alright, gotta get out of the way.

771
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:10,240
You have to get out of the way, excuse me.

772
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,163
- Get on your side. - Let me just finish it.

773
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:13,450
- I will tickle you if you don't move.

774
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,440
- Okay, I'm moving.

775
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,580
Let's turn it up and let's roast it now.

776
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,800
- Bro, it's so messy.

777
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,560
It looks like a stampede came through.

778
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,393
- Wait, do you feel that?

779
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:21,510
- Whoa, whoa, what is going on?

780
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,935
- Devan, look out, look out.

781
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:25,940
(animals stomping)

782
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,730
That was close.

783
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,563
- Uh.

784
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,780
- You're going the wrong way.

785
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,040
Oh no, I just remembered, bro,

786
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,153
I'm gonna have to flip my pancake with the grab hands.

787
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:37,560
- Oh, that's gonna be so bad.

788
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,682
- Nooo.

789
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:40,300
Now, it's time to flip with my claw hand.

790
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,240
We reach into the side.

791
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,210
- What if you use the claw to hold a spatula, Collins?

792
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,351
- Alright, we got the spatula.

793
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:46,353
- [Both] Oh. - Alright, we got the spatula.

794
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:47,620
- Oh, nice, alright go for it.

795
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,680
- Three, two, one.

796
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,910
- Oh.

797
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,510
- There we go, unconventional flip,

798
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,890
but now it is on the table.

799
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,110
- Dude, it looks like a sunset.

800
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,110
Alright, it's ready to flip.

801
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,950
- [Collins] This looks so good, oh my gosh.

802
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,478
- Ready, set, go.

803
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:03,760
- [Both] No, no, no!

804
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,647
- [Collins] Rescue it Devan.

805
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:05,480
- Got it.

806
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,860
- [Collins] That looks so good.

807
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,900
You get to comment down below who won this round,

808
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,530
and right now, we're onto the next one.

809
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,460
- And just for the fun of it,

810
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,743
I actually made some extra pancakes like Godzilla here.

811
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:15,270
- [Collins] That looks so good.

812
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,540
- I also made Shazam.

813
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,993
- Dude, he looks all buff and everything.

814
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:18,826
- I know right.

815
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:20,510
And I made Cuddle Team Leader from Fortnite.

816
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,410
- And so did I.

817
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,400
This is my version of Cuddle Team Leader from Fortnite.

818
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,233
- Looking good, man,

819
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,830
- Exactly, the structure is intact.

820
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,740
See I can hold it by the ears, and it stays up perfect.

821
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,073
Well, the thing is I'm a little bit hungry,

822
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:32,490
so let me just grab something first, here we go.

823
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,910
- What, no, how do you...

824
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,597
- Oh, I am sorry, oh no.

825
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:36,567
- My pancake.

826
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:37,650
- I'm so sorry, man.

827
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,710
I just had to get little food.

828
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,543
- Take your almonds.

829
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:40,376
- I'm sorry bro.

830
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:41,910
I trained him really well so check this out.

831
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,743
Doug.

832
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:43,576
- Hey, Doug.

833
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:44,409
- Sit.

834
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:45,440
(crashing)

835
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,320
Pretty cool. - Sit.

836
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,990
- Hey, Doug, wave.

837
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,090
- Hey.

838
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,182
- Doug, speak.

839
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:52,076
(roars)

840
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:52,909
- Okay.

841
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:54,320
- Sorry, takes a little bit of getting used to.

842
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,343
- I think you might have cooked my pancake.

843
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:57,910
Are you sure you can handle that dragon?

844
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,250
Maybe you should just stick to this one, let go of Doug.

845
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,737
Just handle this dragon.
