1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,495
- What's up, it's Collins Key,

2
00:00:01,495 --> 00:00:03,228
and for today's video I have a goal.

3
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:04,838
I want to make this the cringiest intro

4
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,443
I have ever done to a video.

5
00:00:07,443 --> 00:00:09,137
So, let's try this.

6
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:09,970
Hey.

7
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:14,256
I need Devon to help me out with this!

8
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:15,089
(snaps fingers)

9
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:15,922
Hey.

10
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:17,400
- Hey.

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,687
- If you guys cringed then you are probably

12
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:20,220
gonna play along with us in this game,

13
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,033
because we are doing the Try Not to Cringe challenge.

14
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,480
Devan and I are thinking of doing

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,261
a Try Not to Laugh challenge with water in our mouth,

16
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:27,948
in an upcoming video, so if you guys want us to do that,

17
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:29,237
let us know by liking this video,

18
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,226
and if this video gets enough thumbs up

19
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:33,378
then we will do that video where we literally spit water

20
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:35,319
all over each other.

21
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:36,681
You should make sure to follow Devan on all

22
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:38,624

23
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:39,753

24
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:41,825
- My Snapchat link is right there.

25
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:42,987
- Yeah, and I'm on Snapchat.

26
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:43,975
- Is right there.

27
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:44,808
- Yeah.

28
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:45,641
So go get us on Snapchat cos we're all doing

29
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:46,474
like a whole bunch of behind the scenes,

30
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:48,495
and like extra bloopers that didn't make it into the video,

31
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:49,904
go onto Snapchat.

32
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:52,217
So go ahead and start now, also I'm doing a huge giveaway

33
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:54,408

00:00:57,248 --> 00:01:00,093
- Commenting what your favorite video of Collins' is.

37
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,093
- And last but not least.

38
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:02,289
- Subscribe to this channel.

39
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:03,933
- Hey, you did that, bro, congrats,

40
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:04,766
that was so cringey, bro.

41
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:05,599
- It wasn't that--

42
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,432
- What do you do to cringe.

43
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:07,265
Is is just like,

44
00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:08,098
is that a cringe?

45
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:08,931
I don't know.

46
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:09,764
- Yes.

47
00:01:09,764 --> 00:01:10,597
- I definitely thought about it.

48
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:11,430
- Like that.

49
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,273
- It's more of a feeling, cringe is more of a feeling

50
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,260
that you get.

51
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,824
Alright, well if this is already a cringey enough intro

52
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,207
we're gonna get right into an even cringier videos.

53
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:18,569
Let's do it.

54
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:19,514
♫ Got me--

55
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:20,749
- Ooh!

56
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:21,658
You know what?

57
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:24,254
Maybe I too could be ninja.

58
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:27,337
♫ I want to be ninja

59
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,798
♫ I want to be ninja

60
00:01:31,798 --> 00:01:34,224
♫ I want to chop chop

61
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:36,904
(singing drowned out by laughing)

62
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:40,230
♫ I want to be ninja

63
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,063
- Guys!

64
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:41,896
You know what?

65
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:43,892
I might do it, I might be a ninja soon!

66
00:01:43,892 --> 00:01:46,809
♫ I wanna be ninja

67
00:01:47,764 --> 00:01:50,408
♫ I wanna be ninja

68
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:51,849
- I'm literally crying I'm so uncomfortable right now.

69
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:52,682
- Man.

70
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:54,402
- Why on earth!?

71
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:55,887
- At first I thought that was a voiceover,

72
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:57,824
but she's actually singing the words.

73
00:01:57,824 --> 00:01:59,882
- Like my face is red, I'm crying right now.

74
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:00,956
- Oh my gosh!

75
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:02,358
- I want to chop!

76
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:04,653
- Low-key, there's one girl that was loving it,

77
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:06,920
she's like this is so great!

78
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,645
- That was bad.

79
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,436
We're off to a great start.

80
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:11,269
- Hi, it's Josh here.

81
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:12,102
- Cameron here.

82
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:13,080
- What's up, Cameron, Josh?

83
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,021
- We're gonna be doing the banana and Sprite challenge.

84
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:17,080
So the banana Sprite challenge is to eat two bananas

85
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,482
and then drink a liter of Sprite

86
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:19,966
- Look at those tosses though. - as fast as you can.

87
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:21,299
- He's a master.

88
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:23,755
I wish I could toss like that.

89
00:02:23,755 --> 00:02:24,704
- Both of 'em man.

90
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:25,537
- Oh!

91
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:28,645
- Is he throwing up?

92
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:29,478
- Agh!

93
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:31,145
- That's a throw-up.

94
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:33,814
- That's absolutely ridiculous.

95
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:36,366
- Oh my god oh my god!

96
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,199
- Why?!

97
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,343
Why?

98
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:42,756
- I literally had to avert my eyes.

99
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:44,317
- It just kept on going.

100
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:45,555
- Yeah.

101
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:47,078
That was a lot of contents,

102
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:48,892
he had a lot of stuff in his stomach man,

103
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:49,960
that's all I can say.

104
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,693
- Wow, did he have like 10 Sprites or something?

105
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:52,526
Geez.

106
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:53,359
- I don't know.

107
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,527
I hope that none of you guys are sympathetic thrower-uppers,

108
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:57,713
cos that video would have triggered you.

109
00:02:57,713 --> 00:02:58,698
For sure.

110
00:02:58,698 --> 00:02:59,850
I'm like hugging myself right now.

111
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,788
- Your whole body just is like.

112
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:03,640
- Full body cringe.

113
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,582
Okay, next clip.

114
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:05,582
Let's do it.

115
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:08,776
Oh, but those moves though.

116
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:11,655
Oh my god, I thought that that fell on his leg.

117
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:12,932
That would be me while I'm trying to dance

118
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:14,896
in the kitchen, I'm not even joking.

119
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,084
- Yeah, that wasn't too cringey,

120
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:17,237
it was just kinda.

121
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:19,136
- Yeah, it was just like a fail video.

122
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:21,733
- My wife Kelly is a freaky eater.

123
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:22,640
- A freaky eater?

124
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,787
Is that like--

125
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,065
- [Narrator] 33 year old Kelly eats nothing

126
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:28,857
but cheesy potatoes, morning, noon, and night.

127
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:30,748
- I love cheesy potatoes.

128
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:31,862
- No we cannot.

129
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:34,288
- Gooey and just, yum yum yummy.

130
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:36,470
Each and every day, Kelly eats a minimum

131
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,190
of eight potatoes and four cups of cheese,

132
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,201
amounting to a whopping 8000 calories,

133
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,451
and 176 grams of fat a day.

134
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,615
- [Husband] Well I want you to try this

135
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:48,838
because it's a green vegetable.

136
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,238
- God this is gonna be good.

137
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:52,371
- Tried to cook her a little something extra,

138
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:53,788
she just refuses.

139
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:55,756
- Aww.

140
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,756
- [Husband] Just try a little taste?

141
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:03,145
(laughing)

142
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:07,611
- [Both] Oh man.

143
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:08,767
- I was about to say they need to put some cheese

144
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:11,568
on that vegetable, like maybe some cheese and potatoes.

145
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:14,121
- Yeah, just to disguise it or something.

146
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:14,954
- Wow.

147
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:15,787
- Wow.

148
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:18,234
- Right, well, I think, I low-key wanna try it now,

149
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:19,144
cos if she loves it that much,

150
00:04:19,144 --> 00:04:20,789
it must be really delicious.

151
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:22,352
- All being thrown down by Jake Dub,

152
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:23,917
as he's now gonna go by.

153
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:24,750
- What a name.

154
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,583
- He's definitely been running well.

155
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,743
Two straight tournaments off to a great start

156
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:27,576
in this one.

157
00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:28,516
Thanks so much dude, I appreciate it.

158
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:29,829
Feel like a gangster handshake now,

159
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,479
show me how it's done in Compton.

160
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,627
What was that?

161
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:33,739
Alright, cool, alright.

162
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,907
Let's just, we're gonna put our heads down in shame

163
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:39,012
and walk away from that one.

164
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,775
- Bro like, the worst part is I've done that.

165
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:43,916
- I think every guy has had an awkward handshake.

166
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:44,863
- Cos there's so many!

167
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:47,000
You've got like just the normal handshake.

168
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,900
You've got the, this one.

169
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,733
- Like a bro.

170
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:51,072
You go in for a hug, too, so it could be like

171
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,841
you're going in for a bro and then your hands

172
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:53,674
get like caught.

173
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:54,507
- And it's awkward.

174
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:55,340
- Hey.

175
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,793
- And then you got this, where you get extra fancy,

176
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:57,626
like this.

177
00:04:57,626 --> 00:04:58,459
- Yeah, like that.

178
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,292
- And then some people have like special releases,

179
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,497
where they go like this, and it's like bom,

180
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:02,483
and they blow it up.

181
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:03,316
- You gotta blow up.

182
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:04,453
- Or the time when I seem like this

183
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:06,054
where they go, bom, and then they go back to this,

184
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:08,194
all I'm saying is there's a lot.

185
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:09,270
- Endless variation.

186
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,103
- There's endless variations.

187
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:11,697
So, I think that was pretty bad though.

188
00:05:11,697 --> 00:05:12,887
- But that was really funny.

189
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:14,702
- [Narrator] Hilary Clinton attacked Donald Trump's record

190
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,517
as a businessman and casino owner,

191
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,362
during a speech in Atlantic City, New Jersey today.

192
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,227
- Donald Trump.

193
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:21,477
- Donald Trump!

194
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,010
There we are.

195
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,956
I don't know what's going on.

196
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:26,641
- I definitely know his political views, that's for sure.

197
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:29,807
- And he went live, on accident, I'm guessing?

198
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:30,697
- Donald Trump.

199
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,010
- I don't usually bathe,

200
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,650
but when I do,

201
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,132
I use Pepsi.

202
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:35,965
Whoo!

203
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,157
- Have you guys seen what Pepsi does to your teeth?

204
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:42,341
What's it doing to your whole body at this point?

205
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,861
- Ah, gotta love it.

206
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,095
- Gotta love it?

207
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,519
- I keep the bathtub lined with Pepsi,

208
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,151
just because you gotta still wait here,

209
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:51,386
and leaks out a little.

210
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:53,237
- No, I think it's just for aesthetic.

211
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:55,420
This guy's not a Coke guy.

212
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,150
- Oh my gosh.

213
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,642
- I knew it, I knew he was gonna do it.

214
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:02,405
- That would burn your eyes so bad.

215
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:04,051
(mumble) is the dirtiest part.

216
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:05,202
Ooh, that angle though.

217
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:06,279
That angle though!

218
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,555
How'd they get the camera at that angle

219
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:08,388
is the real question?

220
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:09,221
- He's holding it.

221
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:10,440
He had it in his hand.

222
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,096
- I thought another guy crawled in the tub, was like--

223
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:13,865
- That was my first thought, yeah.

224
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:16,247
(fast techno music)

225
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:17,643
I wish I had those skills, bro.

226
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,476
- Yeah?

227
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:21,434
Was that it?

228
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:22,572
- No, he's back.

229
00:06:22,572 --> 00:06:24,462
- Is he gonna do two at once?

230
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:25,295
No, oh!

231
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,671
What kind of--

232
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:29,023
can't do two at once.

233
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,215
- His legs just gave out.

234
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,898
- [Collin] Oh there's slow motion.

235
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:33,049
- [Both] Oh.

236
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,308
- You know that's bad when you do the head like, bounce off.

237
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,468
- Yeah.

238
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:37,301
- Yeah.

239
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:38,134
- Alright, let's move on.

240
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:39,768
- [Narrator] Peter Boyle is a tough, ill-mannered cop

241
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:42,435
who has run down a lot of dudes.

242
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:46,069
But, that's not the end of his story.

243
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:46,902
No, no.

244
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:49,131
He's reincarnated.

245
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:49,964
- Ah!

246
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:51,350
- Surprise!

247
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,764
- [Narrator] As a streetwise bulldog in Poochinski.

248
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,080
- Oh, no.

249
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,440
- Is this a real thing?

250
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,273
- [Narrator] The talking dog teams up

251
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:00,152
with his astonished former partner--

252
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,582
- Yeah, I'd be astonished if a dog was my reincar,

253
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:04,104
oh no!

254
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,247
- It's a guy doing that, that's not a dog.

255
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,265
(dialog drowned out by laughing)

256
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:09,666
- Nice life.

257
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,295
- That dog is on some next level stuff right now.

258
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:13,695
- I'm a cop!

259
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:14,695
- Okay, I...

260
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,201
Do not want that to happen to me,

261
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,352
that is all I'm gonna say.

262
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:20,220
- I kinda wanna see that pilot episode right there.

263
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,053
- Poochinksi.

264
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:22,405
- Poochinski.

265
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:23,721
- Let's turn over to the water center here.

266
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,778
Cos Churchie with Sanchez sounds like a broken record

267
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,060
this morning, but honestly,

268
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,173
I can log in with a broken record,

269
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:29,492
this is like the best song ever.

270
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:30,859
- Play that song.

271
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:32,260
- You got it, daddy.

272
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,093
- Put that loud.

273
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:34,120
- You got it, daddy.

274
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,061
I like calling you daddy.

275
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:38,289
- Well thank you.

276
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:39,814
- [Both] Hmm.

277
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:40,647
- Okay.

278
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:43,765
- Save that for off-camera, I guess.

279
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:44,830
- Yeah.

280
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,663
- That's not really--

281
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,882
- Not everyone needs to know that.

282
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:47,856
- Yeah, it's not pertinent to the weather.

283
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:48,720
- No.

284
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,803
- Okay, yeah.

285
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:51,566
- Oh no.

286
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,133
- You're kidding me.

287
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,451
No.

288
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:01,284
- No.

289
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:02,117
- No.

290
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:02,950
- No!

291
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,283
That's like a...

292
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:10,787
No.

293
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,472
- Oh, no, no no no no no, no no no.

294
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:13,379
No!

295
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:14,212
No!

296
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:16,360
Oh my gosh!

297
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:19,651
- Oh my gosh!

298
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,238
- Yeah, I'm scarred for life.

299
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:23,474
