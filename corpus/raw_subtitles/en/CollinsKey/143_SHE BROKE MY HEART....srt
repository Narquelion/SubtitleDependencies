1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:03,306
(upbeat rock music)

2
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,492
- I was up all night thinking about it

3
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:20,347
and I've been so fixated on who I want to be

4
00:00:20,347 --> 00:00:21,264
and where I want to be,

5
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:22,503
I haven't thought about who I am.

6
00:00:22,503 --> 00:00:23,609
It's like you and Carlie have been saying,

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,230
I need to just go out there and figure it out--

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,063
- Okay, where are we?

9
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:26,896
Where are we going?

10
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:28,263
Okay, because the car's a half mile back

11
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:30,027
and we gotta bounce if we're gonna make my sister's show.

12
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:31,333
- Dude, chill, we'll make it, okay?

13
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,601
But it's like, it's like a magic trick,

14
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:33,666
a magic trick, 'cause with a magic trick,

15
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,746
it's about the moments you know?

16
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:35,701
It's not about the card tricks.

17
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,663
The card tricks don't mean anything,

18
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,074
it's the moment, the experiences, you know?

19
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:40,041
And it's like what you've been saying, this girl,

20
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,558
she's everything that's been missing in my life.

21
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:42,988
- We gotta go, alright?

22
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:44,588
- The fence says that there's an art show

23
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,182
in downtown this,

24
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:47,289
yeah, yeah, this is the right place, right place.

25
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:48,598
- Collins, just get the video message

26
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:49,431
so we can get outta here.

27
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:50,264
- No she's gotta be in here.

28
00:00:50,264 --> 00:00:51,505
- Collins!

29
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:53,260
You promised, okay?

30
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,331
So we have to go.

31
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:55,272
You have to be there.

32
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:56,375
- No, what I have to do

33
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,803
is stop listening to what everyone says I have to do

34
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:59,004
all the time.

35
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:00,271
This is so important to me Jacob.

36
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:01,886
And I think, I think that I'm in love with this girl.

37
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:02,719
You don't even know what love is!

38
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,704
You haven't even kissed anyone yet.

39
00:01:04,704 --> 00:01:06,338
I didn't, I didn't mean it like that, okay?

40
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:07,171
Just, five minutes, okay?

41
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:09,338
Please, just five minutes.

42
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:12,384
- [Jacob] Okay.

43
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:13,443
Whatever.

44
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:17,610
(soft, dramatic music) (soft chatter)

45
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:20,258
- [Girl] I'm here.

46
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:22,285
Do you see me?

47
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,969
- Sorry, have you seen this girl?

48
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,410
- [Waitress] Uh, yeah, yeah, I have.

49
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,315
- Where?

50
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:30,751
- Uh, just back that way.

51
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,514
- Thank you.

52
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:36,681
(soft, dramatic music) (soft chatter)

53
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:45,167
(dramatic music)

54
00:02:03,704 --> 00:02:04,537
- Collins?

55
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:08,375
What a phenomenal surprise!

56
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,921
So good to see you.

57
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,956
For those of you've had your head

58
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:12,820
in the sand the last few years,

59
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,498
this is the amazing Collins Key.

60
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:19,439
Collins, listen, we are so excited about the shoot tomorrow.

61
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,225
And now that I've got ya here

62
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,517
I just have a couple of ideas for tomorrow.

63
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:24,894
- And I would love to hear those, I just,

64
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,021
give me one quick second 'cause the person

65
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,183
who invited me here, they're right over there,

66
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:28,099
I just have to go say thank you.

67
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,297
I'll be right back, thank you.

68
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:30,450
- Sure.

69
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,700
(soft, dramatic music)

70
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:40,317
Have you seen this girl?

71
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,394
- Back there.

72
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:48,944
(movie reel clicking) (dramatic music)
