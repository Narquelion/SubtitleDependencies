1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,950
- You challenged us to put hot sauce on bananas!

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,216
- Yeah! - I don't like hot sauce,

3
00:00:04,216 --> 00:00:05,408
we're about to roast our taste buds.

4
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:07,339
Here we go we got the hot sauce, uh-oh!

5
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,172
Ahh!

6
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:09,287
- No it's not, you do it from

7
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:10,318
the bottom, - Ahh!

8
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:11,151
- Look at this,

9
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:13,126
it's all nice and open. (Collins grunts)

10
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:15,134
(laughing) (coughing)

11
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:15,978
You good bro?

12
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:17,374
- No, you go from the bottom, you're like this.

13
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,891
We'll throw at the same time.

14
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:21,056
(laughs)

15
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:23,102
I can't open it, bro I need you to open the banana.

16
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:24,559
- You just chucked the banana - Yeah you go like like this,

17
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,950
on the floor. - you go, ow!

18
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,783
- Dude I already.

19
00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:28,366
ah, it's in my eye!

20
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:33,282
- That went everywhere. (laughs)

21
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:34,115
Oops! - Why!

22
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:35,515
- Bananas aren't meant to be in the eye!

23
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:36,652
- Okay, sorry, so now back to what

24
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:37,485
we're actually supposed to be doing,

25
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:38,318
which is eat our bananas.

26
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:39,354
- Oh so now you know how to open it?

27
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:40,435
- This one's not a good one. - No, you,

28
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:41,268
- Yeet!

29
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:42,101
- Really?

30
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:42,934
On the table?

31
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:44,039
I'm going for the hot sauce.

32
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,511
- Ew, it's all like broken and brown.

33
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:47,497
I'm not excited about this because, aw!

34
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:48,330
So much!

35
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,701
So much! - Ugh, it dripped on my hand!

36
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,116
- So, stop, no, no, no!

37
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:52,196
Aw man my hot sauce is dripping.

38
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:53,846
Here we go, the first one, ready?

39
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,679
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

40
00:00:58,278 --> 00:01:00,611
(screaming)

41
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,301
Oh, it hit, it hit!

42
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,329
Oh god!

43
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:07,806
(screaming) Oh, oh no, oh no!

44
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:09,095
Oh, god!

45
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:12,409
(Collins yells loudly)

46
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:13,912
- Whew, that was intense!

47
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:16,287
So this right here is the bowl of doom.

48
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:17,120
So at the end of this video

49
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,253
we're gonna be eating - No!

50
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:19,671
- the weirdest food combination

51
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:20,504
of all time. - Why!

52
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:23,179
- Because every single weird food goes in this bowl.

53
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:25,271
And at the end of it, we've gotta eat that whole thing.

54
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:27,424
It is gonna be gross, and spicy!

55
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:29,008
- All right, next round, let's go.

56
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:30,590
Next up we got fruity pebbles!

57
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,578
(cheering)

58
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:32,411
And hot sauce!

59
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:33,456
I can't believe I just did that.

60
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:34,289
Yeet!

61
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:36,642
Uh, Devan, would you mind retrieving that yeet

62
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:37,669
as I open up this stuff. - No.

63
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:39,169
I will not, no. - I am the oldest sibling,

64
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:40,002
so I am the only one - Nope.

65
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:40,835
- responsible enough - Nope.

66
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:41,668
- to have a knife.

67
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,808
- I do not agree with that statement.

68
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:44,444
Just by the way that you're doing it right now.

69
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:45,277
- See, nothing went wrong! - I feel unsafe.

70
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:47,225
- Dude, smell that!

71
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:48,641
- Oh, yeah, okay. - That smells pretty gross.

72
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,804
Okay Devan, will you please go get the box

73
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:50,663
of Fruity Pebbles? - No.

74
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:51,496
- Please?

75
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:52,785
- I'm smiling right now, but no.

76
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:54,622
- Oh, whip back, okay!

77
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:57,201
- How did that happen?

78
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,034
Really?

79
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:58,929
- That's so small.

80
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:01,475
(laughing)

81
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:02,308
Aw man that hurt.

82
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:04,844
- That's my favorite Collins moment ever.

83
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:06,568
Okay, while you're doing that I'm gonna open up

84
00:02:06,568 --> 00:02:08,690
these buns here.

85
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,085
No, you don't have to crush it up!

86
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:11,918
- Yes you do!

87
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:13,793
- They're called pebbles for a reason, it's not sand.

88
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:14,626
Okay fine!

89
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:15,676
Dude they're literally all connected!

90
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:16,509
- I know,

91
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,342
that's how hotdogs come. - That's crazy!

92
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:18,251
Woo-hoo!

93
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:19,140
(glass shatters)

94
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,440
- That almost hit me in the face.

95
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,538
- This is how you have to put the hotdog in the bun,

96
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:22,371
you ready?

97
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,204
(hotdog slams on table)

98
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:24,954
(laughing)

99
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:26,123
Oh, it broke my bun!

100
00:02:26,123 --> 00:02:27,273
Yeet! - No!

101
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,556
I'm just gonna take one.

102
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:30,193
So at least we have one to try.

103
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,147
- This is the part of the video where

104
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:33,485
it's hotdog trick shots.

105
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,151
Oh! - Oh!

106
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,209
- First try!

107
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:37,436
Haha, that was awesome!

108
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:39,515
- That was actually the first, not like all the other tries

109
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:40,556
that were first tries.

110
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:42,455
This was actually a first try.

111
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:43,288
- Exposed!

112
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,379
- All right, you ready? - Yep.

113
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,954
- I'm gonna ketchup you.

114
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:47,787
- Uh, that's a weird sound.

115
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:49,565
Okay, that's enough, that's, ah, no, stop stop stop!

116
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:52,308
Dude, dude, dude, dude dude dude, stop stop stop!

117
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:53,141
Devan Devan Devan!

118
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:55,044
- This is for all the yeeting that you did.

119
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:55,877
That's a lot of ketchup.

120
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:56,710
- I know.

121
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,543
So it sticks.

122
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:58,376
You ready?

123
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,528
- Are you sh, no!

124
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:00,769
- Perfect!

125
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,721
- I don't want to have to clean it up.

126
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:04,579
- Well I could just use the remainder for my hotdog.

127
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:05,412
- Yep, there you go.

128
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:06,245
- You know what I'm gonna do?

129
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:07,078
- No, I don't.

130
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:08,853
- I'm gonna do a layer of it, below the actual,

131
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:09,686
- Oh, that's neat!

132
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:10,519
- Ready?

133
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:11,352
- Yep.

134
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:12,817
(grunting)

135
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,180
The hotdog trick shot challenge is not for everyone.

136
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,135
- I have 50% less Fruity Pebbles.

137
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:19,580
Now I'm gonna do some ketchup one mine, so it sticks.

138
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,080
And I'll do just about as much as I did on yours.

139
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,963
- Okay. - Perfect.

140
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:24,254
- What? (sinister laughing)

141
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:26,157
I mean who am I to be telling Devan not to make a mess?

142
00:03:26,157 --> 00:03:27,730
- It's my one time, I just felt like it.

143
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,792
- The roles have been reversed.

144
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,435
- Who honestly thought about this?

145
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,780
Like, who thought to combine Fruity Pebbles

146
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,613
with a hotdog?

147
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:34,963
Did they go through a trial process?

148
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:37,877
Did they like, dump a ton of other cereals on it?

149
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:39,938
And be like, "Oh, fruity Pebbles was the best,"

150
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:41,215
- All right, here we go! - Ready, cheers!

151
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,269
- No, don't touch mine!

152
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,206
- I did, I already did, it's too late.

153
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:45,221
- Three! - I didn't wanna do that.

154
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,360
Yours was on the floor. - Two!

155
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,012
Yeah I forgot about that! - Yeah, I know.

156
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:48,845
One! - One!

157
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,178
(crunching)

158
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:56,528
(coughing)

159
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,781
Oh. - Oh, man.

160
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,896
- Oh, no! - Oh god.

161
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:00,729
- Mm-mm.

162
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:01,562
(grunting)

163
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:02,898
- That, (moaning)

164
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:04,943
So disgusting, so we're gonna add a little bit to the bowl

165
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:06,572
right now, a little bit of ketchup.

166
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:08,935
(screeching) - Who's idea was that!

167
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:09,808
- Chunk of hotdog.

168
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:11,352
- Oh, I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

169
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,185
- Yeah that was bad.

170
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,306
But the Fruity Pebbles just made it horrible!

171
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:16,139
I'm getting sick.

172
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:16,972
All right we gotta go to the next round.

173
00:04:16,972 --> 00:04:17,805
- That was the worst I've ever had.

174
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:18,638
- Next round, let's go.

175
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:20,517
I'm getting some crazy flashbacks right now,

176
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:21,781
but we've got Cheetos! - Oh, yes.

177
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:23,130
- And we're mixing it with chocolate pudding.

178
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,213
- Yes we are.

179
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:26,549
(cheering)

180
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:27,382
- That was close. Successful!

181
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:28,920
- Alright let me see it.

182
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,570
- Oh, it went on the drape!

183
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,653
Dude, it literally went on the drape!

184
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:34,486
- Oh, I'm in trouble.

185
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:35,319
- Well that's yours.

186
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,816
- But dude, I mean, on the bright side,

187
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:38,361
look, it like, landed in the bowl.

188
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,215
Alright now we got the Cheetos.

189
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:41,252
Oh, that was easy, okay cool.

190
00:04:41,252 --> 00:04:42,500
- You got me nervous there for a second.

191
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,878
- Ah, smells good, smells spicy.

192
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:45,780
- Alright. - Okay, cool,

193
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,852
oh I have chocolate, i'm getting chocolate

194
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,391
over everything, man. - Oh, no.

195
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:52,149
- So we're gonna pop one Cheeto out.

196
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,193
- Took me a long time to get one.

197
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,009
It's like a little hand, do you see that?

198
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,035
- It's like, "what's up, dude,"

199
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:57,414
(yelling)

200
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:59,650
Alright, here we go, I'm doing my scoop.

201
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,483
Oh!

202
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,316
- Three!

203
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:02,983
Two, one. - Two, one.

204
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:06,237
Bro.

205
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:07,070
- Dude!

206
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,382
- I think I'm just eating the pudding right now, but,

207
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:09,260
mmm! - Mmm!

208
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,093
- Mmm!

209
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,036
I don't even taste the Cheeto.

210
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:12,667
(kisses) - Mmm!

211
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,664
That was incredible! - Bro!

212
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,481
So good! - I think that might be my

213
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,989
favorite weird food combination we've ever tried.

214
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:20,097
Mwah, so good!

215
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:21,607
So we're gonna add now some Cheetos in here,

216
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:22,757
and some pudding.

217
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:23,590
- A ton of pudding!

218
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,423
All of the pudding!

219
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:25,539
- Oh yeah.

220
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,464
Next round!

221
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:27,397
- [Devan] Let's go.

222
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:28,855
- Next up we've got:

223
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:29,763
- Yep, it's

224
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:30,596
spaghetti tacos! - Spaghetti tacos!

225
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,528
You guys suggested it!

226
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:33,571
- Wait did they suggest spaghetti tacos?

227
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:34,500
Or spagacos?

228
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,554
- Uh, I don't know.

229
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:38,673
And uh, we're gonna, yeet, some uh, some tacos.

230
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:39,506
- All right.

231
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,616
- Ugh, so the yeet didn't even go anywhere.

232
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:41,449
The distance was not there, man.

233
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,309
- You've gotta work on your form.

234
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,571
- Can you imagine going to a really fancy restaurant

235
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:45,532
and they're like, "Oh, sir, what would you like?"

236
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:46,536
Like, "I want spagacos!"

237
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:47,729
- That's a little aggressive, I think.

238
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:49,412
(laughing)

239
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:51,612
(wrapper hits the ground) (laughing)

240
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:52,544
- So we're gonna put this in here.

241
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:54,204
- Yeah, this is kind of difficult, actually.

242
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:55,377
- Yeah it's actually pretty difficult.

243
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:57,008
- Oh no, I cracked my taco.

244
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:57,841
- Did you crack your taco?

245
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:58,674
- Yeah I cracked it.

246
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:00,230
Alright, oh, nope. - Yeah that fell apart.

247
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,244
We got some Prego spaghetti sauce.

248
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:03,322
Get lost in the sauce.

249
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,472
I messed it up a little bit.

250
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:05,760
- [Devan] Wow that was really bad.

251
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,859
- Oh, it's gonna be super messy,

252
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:08,990
and yet please do not screenshot and then post on Instagram.

253
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,168
Because you guys do that all the time,

254
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:11,317
and this is not one of those moments where

255
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,150
I want this everywhere.

256
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,225
- Bro, it's dripping everywhere.

257
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:14,058
- Okay. - You better just go now.

258
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:15,066
- Here we go, three,

259
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,809
Two, one. - Two, one.

260
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,142
(crunching)

261
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,341
All right!

262
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,174
- Mm-hm!

263
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:26,007
That was awesome!

264
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:27,075
- I mean there was really nothing that different

265
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:28,841
other than the taco shell. - Mm-hm!

266
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:30,194
Alright now it's time to add it to the bowl.

267
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:31,843
We're gonna make the biggest taco of all time.

268
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:33,551
Just kinda like, get all the taco shells.

269
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:34,881
- This is so unnecessary.

270
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,661
- [Collins] And then we get like, ugh!

271
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:37,968
- [Devan] Our teeth are gonna get hurt!

272
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:38,801
- [Collins] Then we go, ugh!

273
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:39,634
- Our gums are gonna get,

274
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,078
(yelling)

275
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:41,911
Why!

276
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:43,285
- Okay, great!

277
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:44,335
That was actually really good.

278
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:45,567
I'm a big fan of this one. - Yeah.

279
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:46,895
- So right now, we're on to the next one.

280
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:48,760
We are doing a cookie sandwich,

281
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,223
but instead of ice cream in the middle,

282
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,023
we are putting cheese!

283
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:53,543
Why!

284
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:54,376
Why!

285
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:55,921
So I guess we each take cookies.

286
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:56,774
- Two of them, to be exact.

287
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:57,887
- Actually, I'm gonna do more 'cause I'm gonna do a

288
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:00,020
multi-layered masterpiece right now.

289
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,285
- Go for it. - Okay, so this is what

290
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:02,268
we're gonna do, we got our cheese.

291
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:03,101
(Collins inhales deeply)

292
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:04,642
Yep, smells like cheese!

293
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:05,877
- That's how you know if it's cheese?

294
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:06,710
You smell it?

295
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,192
- Absolutely. - You can't look at this

296
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:09,366
and be like, "Oh, that's cheese,"

297
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:10,199
- No, bro.

298
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,740
It could be like, a sliced carrot.

299
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,081
- What? (Collins mimicking slicer)

300
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:13,914
(laughing)

301
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:14,791
- Put the cookie on top, boom!

302
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,552
So this is normally where you would leave it like this,

303
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:17,655
unless you do like a lot of, oh!

304
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,333
I'm just gonna do a lot of stacks of cheese!

305
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,166
- Okay.

306
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:20,999
- So instead of doing

307
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:21,991
a lot of cookies, - Wait wait wait wait wait!

308
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:23,105
- I'm just doing many, - No no no no no!

309
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:24,234
- What? - Hold on, you should do it

310
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:25,103
like this, you should do it like this.

311
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:26,119
There you go. - Oh.

312
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:26,952
- [Devan] Yeah yeah there you go.

313
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:27,785
- See, Devan's an artist.

314
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:29,451
And he knows these things. - This'll look awesome.

315
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:32,534
(cheery piano music)

316
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,790
- And now for the finishing touch!

317
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,734
I have done so much. - Wow.

318
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:39,116
- So guys, this right here is massive.

319
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:41,176
- [Devan] It's like all cheese and a little bit of cookie.

320
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:43,879
- Holy cow bro, look at that, this thing is crazy!

321
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,684
So, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to.

322
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:46,517
- [Devan] I don't know.

323
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:47,583
- Dude, let's put them in the microwave

324
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,005
and like, melt the cheese!

325
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,221
- Are you sure, that's gonna be a lot of melted cheese.

326
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,054
- Let's do it.

327
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:52,887
- Let's do it.

328
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:54,106
- [Collins] All right, here we go, oh!

329
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,472
That almost slid all over the place.

330
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:57,364
I got it, there we go, okay.

331
00:07:57,364 --> 00:08:00,447
(cheery piano music)

332
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:02,893
- [Devan] Alright let's check it out!

333
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:04,177
- Oh! - Oh, my!

334
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:05,731
- [Collins] What happened to yours!

335
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:06,564
- [Devan] I don't know.

336
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:07,503
- [Collins] Why does mine look better than yours?

337
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:08,336
Okay, here we go.

338
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:09,169
- [Devan] Is it hot?

339
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:10,002
It's not hot.

340
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:11,877
- [Collins] Ah, watch out, yeah, yeah, it's a little hot.

341
00:08:11,877 --> 00:08:12,710
(chuckling)

342
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,659
- Yo, yours looks a little runny, if you know what I mean.

343
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:16,977
- I'm not excited to eat this.

344
00:08:16,977 --> 00:08:18,563
- Can I even pick mine up anymore?

345
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:19,962
I think I might have to have a rescue mission

346
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:21,604
and like, break the stack in half.

347
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:22,920
Otherwise there's no way I'm gonna be able

348
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,862
to get that bottom half, okay.

349
00:08:23,862 --> 00:08:25,358
Whoa!

350
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:26,623
- [Devan] That's a lot of cheese.

351
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,139
- That's a lot of cheese.

352
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,845
Jeez it's cheese.

353
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:31,086
- Look at this, I can't even pick it up.

354
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:32,625
It's just mush. - That's pretty crazy.

355
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,775
- Maybe I should just eat this with a fork.

356
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:34,931
- No Devan, come on bro.

357
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,077
- I went against everything you told me and I got a fork.

358
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:38,153
So, yeah.

359
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,848
- This thing here is gonna be, first of all,

360
00:08:39,848 --> 00:08:40,927
very interesting to try and eat,

361
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:44,394
and second of all, really interesting on how it tastes.

362
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:45,227
Are you ready?

363
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:46,060
- Nope, not yet.

364
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,641
Just making, you know, it bite size.

365
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:48,659
- Alright here we go, three,

366
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,563
Two, one, - Two, one,

367
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,318

- Alright here we go, three,

00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,008
Two, one. - Two, one.

378
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:13,440
Mmm.

379
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,273
- Bro.

380
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:15,946
- What the heck?

381
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:16,779
- Bro.

382
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:17,640
Microwaving, mmm.

383
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,500
- That started off good, - What?

384
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,423
- Ugh! - Too much cheese?

385
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:22,256
- Too much cheese.

386
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:23,089
- I wonder.

387
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,072
Mine was so good.

388
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:25,532
- We don't have, unfortunately, any more cheese.

389
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:26,449
So we're gonna have to like, - Yep.

390
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:27,282
- scoop what's on here

391
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:28,184
into the bowl. - Aw really?

392
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:29,259
You couldn't have just done mine?

393
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:30,651
- [Collins] Ugh!

394
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:32,636
- That does look, - It's all greasy, okay.

395
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:33,958
- We need more cookies than that.

396
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,450
- More cookies, dude we're not gonna have any more room!

397
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,000
- I know, that's the point.

398
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,833
- All right.

399
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,854
For this weird food combination

400
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:41,031
we're doing cereal and avocados.

401
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:41,864
- Wow, okay.

402
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:42,839
- (laughs) oops.

403
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,459
Okay so now we're gonna open it up.

404
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,292
- No.

405
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,042
(sad piano music)

406
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:48,875
Not today.

407
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,958
(crying)

408
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,933
Not a good idea.

409
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,290
Dude, there's already avocado on the rim of this!

410
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,957
How did that happen?

411
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,693
- Cereal and avocados.

412
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:02,511
- Oh. - Oh.

413
00:10:02,511 --> 00:10:04,094
Alright, your bowl.

414
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:06,462
- Alright now as all of you guys know,

415
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:08,621
there's a massive pit inside the avocado.

416
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:10,402
And so the way you gotta open it is use a spoon,

417
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,408
go like that, there we go, boom.

418
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:12,714
'Cause then now you just go like this.

419
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:14,883
You just kinda, there we go.

420
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:16,783
- I don't think I've seen anybody do this.

421
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,075
- Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh!

422
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:19,908
There we go!

423
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:20,887
- No I don't want you - You just squeeze.

424
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,191
- to do mine, I don't want you to do mine, why!

425
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:24,024
Ugh!

426
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:24,956
- There we go, perfect!

427
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:25,999
But now it's kinda-- - Are you now gonna eat it

428
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:26,878
with your hand or something?

429
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:29,234
- No, dude, you're not gonna be uncivilized.

430
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,237
Okay all jokes aside, this smells disgusting right now.

431
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:32,070
- Milk for you.

432
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,803
- Dude, I can't, my hands have zero grip.

433
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:34,765
Alright, there we go, boom!

434
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:35,885
My hands are so gross!

435
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,718
I don't like this.

436
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:37,551
I should've never done that.

437
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:40,310
Get some Cinnamon Toast Crunch and, avocado?

438
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,963
- I'm hoping the Cinnamon Toast Crunch, like, really

439
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:44,004
overpowers, that's the word

440
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:45,452
I was looking for. - I need more.

441
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:46,452
Okay, here we go. - Get more crunch.

442
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:47,285
- Three,

443
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:49,026
two, one! - Two, one!

444
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:51,359
(crunching)

445
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:53,727
- I can't do it.

446
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,330
(laughing)

447
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,541
- Like it's not terrible.

448
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,374
(chokes)

449
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:58,207
(groaning)

450
00:10:58,207 --> 00:10:59,101
Oh, that was gross.

451
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:00,843
Whoever suggested this, why?

452
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:01,676
- Why?

453
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:02,869
- We are doing mayonnaise - Who likes this?

454
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:03,702
- and jello.

455
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:04,765
Like, who eats this!

456
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:05,598
- Ugh.

457
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,431
Oh.

458
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:07,264
Ew.

459
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:08,877
Oh, it's so gross.

460
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:09,960
Just do this much.

461
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,793
Alright, we're good.

462
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:12,476
- So I gotta, oh!

463
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:14,606
(grunting) Oh my gosh, ugh!

464
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:16,665
- We need a lot of jello to

465
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:17,799
counteract this. - Yeah we need a lot of jello

466
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,632
to counteract this.

467
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:19,465
- [Devan] So jiggly.

468
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:20,606
- So jiggly.

469
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:23,307
(cheering and laughing)

470
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,417
It's so jiggly you gotta go.

471
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,250
(laughing)

472
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,683
We're very easily entertained as you guys can tell.

473
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:27,516
- Seriously.

474
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:28,349
What are you doing?

475
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:29,182
- I'm pre-mixing my jello!

476
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:30,015
- It's not gonna mix.

477
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:33,415
(jello shaking in container)

478
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:35,277
- [Narrator] One eternity later.

479
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,110
- I got all day.

480
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,823
- I don't, though, that's the problem.

481
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,948
- Pop it open, not too much.

482
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:42,539
(laughing)

483
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:46,524
Man, these jellos are, you gotta like, ahhh!

484
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:47,761
- Dude, this might actually taste delicious!

485
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:49,050
'Cause like, with all this jello mixed in here,

486
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,454
it almost looks like a candy cane, bro.

487
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:52,287
- I don't know.

488
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:53,451
The smells are not convincing me.

489
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:55,035
Oh, this looks gross!

490
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:55,868
♪ Whip it through ♪ - No, no no,

491
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:56,701
♪ the sauce, boy ♪ - no no no no!

492
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:57,625
You're splashing it

493
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,458
everywhere! - Oh.

494
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,505
- Now it's all over you.

495
00:11:59,505 --> 00:12:00,739
- [Collins] Good luck getting your spoon out.

496
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:01,911
- Nope, I'm not doing that.

497
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:03,316
- Come on! - I'm gonna get a new one.

498
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:04,658
- You gotta get,

499
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:05,890
So I found a new place for my chin to rest.

500
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,819
- Yes. - On your elbow.

501
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:07,752
- It's really nice.

502
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:09,731
It's getting really fatiguing, though, so--

503
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:10,697
Do you agree?

504
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:11,530
Yeah.

505
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,363
- My spoon full?

506
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:14,341
We'll have another spoon part of it, there we go.

507
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,405
I got two spoonfuls in one.

508
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:17,517
Whereas Devan's spoon is just a massive one.

509
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,772
- I'm telling you, this smells really bad.

510
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,146
- Holy cow! - I'm not even gonna go

511
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:22,460
that close to it because I can already

512
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,549
smell it. - Alright, you ready?

513
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:24,382
- Yeah I'm ready. - Three,

514
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:25,686
two, one, - two, one,

515
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:27,817
- Wait wait wait, first, three second like challenge

516
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:28,650
right now! - Oh snap!

517
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,397
- Can you like this video in three seconds, here we go!

518
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:33,161
Three, two, one, done! - Three, two, one, done!

519
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,192
- Let's try this, here we go!

520
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,359
Three two one!

521
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:37,700
Oh!

522
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,533
- Mmm!

523
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:41,409
Mm-mm. (Collins yelling)

524
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:42,785
- Oh my gosh bro! - Uh!

525
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,550
- For a second I was like, I just got hit with the jello,

526
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,659
I'm like, "yo this is pretty bomb,"

527
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:46,492
and then-- - No--

528
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:47,939
- Oh my gosh. - No, nope, I can't.

529
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:48,772
- This!

530
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,593
- [Devan] That's all we need of that.

531
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:51,696
- No no no, one more. - No no no no no no!

532
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:52,529
- We gotta go one more bro!

533
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:53,362
- No, please!

534
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:54,529
- For you guys, one more. - Please no!

535
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:56,056
- Here we go. - No!

536
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:57,419
- Oh man, so gross.

537
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,055
Alright guys, we're getting close to eating this entire bowl

538
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:01,522
of disgustingness, but right now,

539
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:03,080
we're on to the next round.

540
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,030
Oh. - Ugh.

541
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,034
- Again! - Nice!

542
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:07,339
- Hoho, that was like a 3D action there.

543
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:08,531
I bet someone was watching they were like, "ah,"

544
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,292
We're doing frosting with pickles.

545
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,125
- What?

546
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,382
- Ah! - Let me smell.

547
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:14,882
Yeah that's great.

548
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:18,444
- Ugh, singes your nose hairs.

549
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:19,277
- Wha, oh, haha.

550
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:20,862
- The water made this thing look massive,

551
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:21,791
I pulled it out I'm like, "What?"

552
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,904
Never thought I'd eat this.

553
00:13:22,904 --> 00:13:23,892
- Alright, my turn!

554
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:25,523
- Quite the scoop there, dude.

555
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:28,356
Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

556
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:31,831
(crunching)

557
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:32,698
- That was actually delicious.

558
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:33,531
- What?

559
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:35,038
- I just love frosting, like, frosting on anything I think

560
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:36,370
would just taste fantastic.

561
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,203
- You're going for another?

562
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:38,833
- It's for the bowl, Devan.

563
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,238
You think I'm really gonna volunteer

564
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:41,071
myself out to eat another one?

565
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,256
- Well, yeah, you said it was delicious!

566
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,800
And I don't know who thinks this is delicious.

567
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,633
Because it's not. - Yeah, it actually was

568
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:45,768
pretty fantastic. - No it's not.

569
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:49,051
By themselves, separately, yes, but together, no.

570
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:50,325
- Alright I'm gonna see how much frosting

571
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:51,158
I can get on this one.

572
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:52,091
Gargantuan.

573
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:52,945
- Wow that's a lot.

574
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:54,636
- Alright there we go!

575
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:55,664
And we're coming down the finale guys!

576
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:58,743
Very soon, we're gonna be eating this bowl right...

577
00:13:58,743 --> 00:13:59,872
(laughing)

578
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,382
Are you kidding me, Devan?

579
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,050
- I'm turning into you, I am actually turning into you.

580
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,883
- Yep, that's not good.

581
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:05,716
- It's on my shoulder.

582
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:07,141
- Oh!

583
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:07,974
- I don't, yeah,

584
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:09,961
- Alright so guys, onto the next round, let's go.

585
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:11,461
And right now, oh!

586
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,419
That was not good!

587
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:15,252
It's the finale.

588
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:16,085
- It's the finale.

589
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:18,421
- We're making the craziest sandwich of all time.

590
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:21,260
We got bread, we got bologna, we got tomatoes.

591
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,236
We got jelly, we got popcorn, we got peanut butter.

592
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:26,657
We got this stuff, I don't really know what this is.

593
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,581
Thick cut bologna.

594
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:29,414
Thick!

595
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:30,359
Here we go! - Alright!

596
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,712
So we first grab the bread, - Yep.

597
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:33,349
(glass shattering)

598
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:34,632
Perfect. - Nice.

599
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:35,465
You know what?

600
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:36,608
You're gonna go for the peanut butter version.

601
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:37,567
I'm gonna go for the jelly version.

602
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,107
- Oh man I love peanut butter, look at that.

603
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:39,960
Look at that, look at that.

604
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,864
Look at, dude, look it, just, Devan, look at, look at,

605
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:42,697
- Oh, wow, yeah.

606
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:44,535
- Alright, alright, grab out some peanut butter.

607
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,059
- And I'm gonna grab out some jelly.

608
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,185
- [Collins] Oh man this does not spread well.

609
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:49,018
- [Devan] No it doesn't.

610
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,131
- [Collins] I think I also grabbed way too much.

611
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:52,893
- I want a lot of jelly on mine 'cause I love jelly.

612
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:53,743
- You love jelly?

613
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:54,601
- I love jelly.

614
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:57,018
Oh, no, dripped a little bit.

615
00:14:58,751 --> 00:14:59,584
- I'm done!

616
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:00,542
You can't go better than that!

617
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:01,483
- That was amazing!

618
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,352
- Yeah it was pretty crazy.

619
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:03,844
Like I've never done that before.

620
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:05,356
How crazy would it be if I took the tomatoes and dropped

621
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:06,540
them and they sliced themselves midair?

622
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,933
- I don't think you should try it.

623
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:08,902
- Yeah dude, no, okay.

624
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:09,735
- I feel like there's gonna be some

625
00:15:09,735 --> 00:15:10,568
collateral damage with that.

626
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:14,130
- Alright so then we got some pepperoni.

627
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,244
I'm not really excited to have to eat

628
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:17,353
this disgusting bowl. - Nor am I.

629
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:18,903
Bologna.

630
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:21,886
- [Collins] Ooh, oh that's nice, oh yeah.

631
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:22,819
- Save some for me.

632
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:23,877
- [Collins] Dude I'm gonna go with the side that has

633
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:24,710
the sticker on it.

634
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,543
- And you're gonna eat that?

635
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:26,376
- 'Cause why not?

636
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:27,209
It's a weird food combination. - 'Cause it's bad?

637
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,751
- Should I just put the whole tomato on mine?

638
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:31,831
- Do that, yes!

639
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,164
Now I got some popcorn dude.

640
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:36,562
I love popcorn!

641
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,544
- I don't want to use a knife so I'm actually gonna

642
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:40,254
break it in half instead of cut it.

643
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:43,931
- Popcorn's fantastic, man, oh my god.

644
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:44,764
- I don't think I've ever done this.

645
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:46,804
Okay, there we go, that looks good.

646
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:47,656
(Collins mumbling)

647
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,929
Your eyes are so wide right now.

648
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:50,061
- Oh my god I love popcorn.

649
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:51,302
- Well save some for me!

650
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:52,164
Ska-doosh!

651
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:52,997
Nice.

652
00:15:52,997 --> 00:15:57,813
- Alright, now it's time to put the popcorn on mine!

653
00:15:57,813 --> 00:15:58,646
Perfect!

654
00:15:58,646 --> 00:15:59,942
- For a man who loves popcorn so much,

655
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:01,591
I'm really surprised there's only one kernel.

656
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:02,688
Alright, my sandwich is done!

657
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:03,521
- Hm?

658
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:04,354
- You're procrastinating.

659
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:05,487
- What? - Huh?

660
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:06,620
(crunching and mumbling)

661
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,236
- What, I'm just gonna go both at the same time.

662
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:09,352
Three, two, one,

663
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:10,264
- Oh, my bologna makes it

664
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:11,335
slippery! - Ah, no, it fell!

665
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:12,411
- My bread cannot contain this.

666
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:13,746
Alright guys, so this is gonna be the weirdest

667
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:15,958
sandwich combination we've ever tried.

668
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,384
And now, after this, we're gonna be eating

669
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:21,421
the weirdest food combination of all time.

670
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:22,873
And this is one here was actually suggested by

671
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:24,325
the Instagram Keyper of the week.

672
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,023
So shout-out to you, and if you want a shout-out as the

673
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:26,856
Instagram Keyper of the week,

674
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:28,135
check the description down below.

675
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:29,466
I don't wanna eat that sticker but I gotta do it!

676
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:32,299
Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

677
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:36,222
(choking)

678
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:37,175
- Oh man!

679
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:38,533
Oh man! (groaning)

680
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:39,431
I can't, I can't.

681
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,298
(groans)

682
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:41,589
- Ooh!

683
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:42,690
That was bad!

684
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,007
- Ohh, man!

685
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:44,930
- Bro, that was terrible!

686
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,973
(Collins exclaiming in disgust)

687
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:47,348
- [Devan] Ugh, I don't know if I'm ready.

688
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,739
- This is the weirdest food combination yet.

689
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:50,627
We've already done two of those,

690
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:51,528
and I thought those were bad?

691
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:53,367
This is worse, bro!

692
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:55,765
- I literally can't describe how bad this smells to you.

693
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,862
- Grab yourself your fork, Devan.

694
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:57,861
- This is what we're using?

695
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:58,694
Alright. - Yeah.

696
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:01,421
So we're just gonna kinda mix it up, gotta mix it, okay.

697
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,681
Dude I forgot about the mayonnaise and jello!

698
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:04,547
- Oh no!

699
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:05,380
- The cookie's just like,

700
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,463
♪ I believe I can fly ♪

701
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:08,672
- [Devan] The pasta's like, "woo-hoo,"

702
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:10,072
♪ I believe I can ♪

703
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,030
- [Devan] Ooh.

704
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,528
- A big chunk of cheese! - Oh, man!

705
00:17:13,528 --> 00:17:14,872
- [Collins] This just looks like a pasta, too, man!

706
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:15,705
- [Devan] I know!

707
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:17,220
- What's so hard, is this a, oh, it's a cookie.

708
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,967
I was like, "is there a cardboard in this thing,"

709
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:20,602
- Ohh! - Ohh, my gosh!

710
00:17:20,602 --> 00:17:21,435
Dude, I,

711
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:22,372
- The smell doesn't get better.

712
00:17:22,372 --> 00:17:23,249
(inhaling)

713
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:24,082
- Fresh air.

714
00:17:24,082 --> 00:17:24,915
I got a piece of the hotdog!

715
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:27,991
Okay, so I just say we grab a big ole' spoonful right now,

716
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:29,741
or sporkful, forkful?

717
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,508
There's just all this grossness.

718
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:34,049
