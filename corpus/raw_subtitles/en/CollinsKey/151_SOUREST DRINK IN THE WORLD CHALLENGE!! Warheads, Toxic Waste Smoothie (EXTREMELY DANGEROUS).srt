1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- What's up, guys?

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,436
It's Collins Key and for today's video

3
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:05,584
I'm gonna be completely destroying my taste buds,

4
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:07,101
and to do this, I need a friend to enjoy me.

5
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:09,291
So everyone, please welcome Brent Rivera.

6
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,124
- What is up, everyone?

7
00:00:10,124 --> 00:00:11,302
Hope you guys are having an amazing day today.

8
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,457
Thank you so much for having me.

9
00:00:13,457 --> 00:00:14,983
I'm sorry, that just comes with it.

10
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:15,841
- That was impressive.

11
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:16,674
Yeah, Brent.

12
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:19,040
- We are gonna be creating the most sour drink

13
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,054
in the entire world.

14
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,760
We have a whole bunch of sour candy right here.

15
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,422
We have Toxic Waste, lemon juice, we got some sodas,

16
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:28,010
we have malic acid.

17
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,795
This stuff is death to your mouth.

18
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:31,416
This is what they put in sour candy,

19
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,607
like this is the main ingredient and its like concentrated

20
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,134
in this container right here.

21
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:37,582
So basically, we're gonna be trying each one of these

22
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:40,979
individually first and then dumping it all inside of here

23
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,735
and then we both have to drink the most sour drink

24
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:44,771
in the entire world.

25
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,818
Hopefully, we don't die.

26
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:47,370
Give this video a thumbs up for the fact that

27
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,560
we probably won't be able to taste anything for

28
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,980
I would say, a month after this video.

29
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,544
Now we also did a video over on Brent's channel.

30
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:54,354
We did social media in real life

31
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,898
and it was absolutely hilarious

32
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:58,011
so make sure you guys go check that out after this video.

33
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,648

- Five seconds.

42
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,733

43
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:14,566

to the channel in five seconds.

47
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:26,050
And right now, without any further ado, yeah let's do it.

48
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,151
First thing we're trying is a soda so here we go.

49
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:31,068
(electronic music)

50
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:35,644
- Oh, that's sour.

51
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:36,477
That's sour.

52
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:37,310
- That's pretty sour.

53
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,752
Alright, well um, this is the first ingredient

54
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:41,090
so I'm gonna dump mine in first.

55
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,098
Here we go.

56
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:43,597
(suspenseful music)

57
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:44,484
Alright, so you know what, Brent?

58
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:45,619
I think we give the people what they want

59
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:47,909
and we'll kick it off right off the bat

60
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,189
with some Toxic Waste because as you guys know

61
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,094
I've done this in one other video.

62
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:53,890
Literally, this thing killed me.

63
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,723
Toxic Waste, three, two, one, go.

64
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:58,890
(screams)

65
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,532
- The trick is, if you get three blue raspberries, one lime,

66
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:04,841
it's not gonna be as sour.

67
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:05,674
- Really?

68
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:06,507
- No, I'm kidding.

69
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:07,619
- Oh, I was like I did not know this.

70
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:08,452
I messed this up.

71
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:09,285
Alright, here we go.

72
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:10,118
Oh, mine has a hair on it.

73
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:11,327
Let me get that off, yuck.

74
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:12,160
Alright, here we go, you ready?

75
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,993
Three. - All at once?

76
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:16,076
What do we do with it? - Two, one, go.

77
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:18,618
I'm good.

78
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:19,683
(deeply inhales)

79
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:21,766
(grunts)

80
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,251
(screams)

81
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,410
- I can already feel my taste buds 50% gone.

82
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,732
(screams)

83
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,589
My taste buds are legitimately gone at the moment.

84
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:47,751
(screams)

85
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,582
I had a little bit on my lips, and I just licked my lips.

86
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:51,481
Brought it all back.

87
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,539
- Okay, to add all the Toxic Waste to it now so

88
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,002
I'm gonna drop a few in.

89
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:56,210
- How many should I drop in, two?

90
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,302
- Two works, yeah. - One, two.

91
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,403
My tongue is numb.

92
00:02:58,403 --> 00:02:59,244
Think that might be a good thing

93
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:01,035
'cause then our tongue is numb for the rest.

94
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:02,043
(suspenseful music)

95
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:03,759
Next, this looks good.

96
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,592
What is this?

97
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:05,425
- Yeah, that actually looks delicious.

98
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:06,306
It's more Toxic Waste, wait.

99
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:07,456
- No, wait, wait, wait, hold up then.

100
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:09,463
No more Toxic Waste, uh-uh.

101
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:11,039
I think the Dots Sours look good.

102
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,548
- Alright, let's give it a shot.

103
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:14,446
- Hopefully this is better than that Toxic Waste.

104
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:16,535
I expected it because the name is Toxic Waste

105
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:18,247
but that was more than I expected.

106
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:19,080
- Here are the Dots.

107
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,314
So, I say we gotta do a handful as well

108
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,432
'cause like this is an extreme challenge, bro.

109
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:23,265
- Okay.

110
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:24,431
- Alright, you probably can't see but there's like

111
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,918
a whole bunch of like powder stuff on here.

112
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:28,038
That is the malic acid stuff, okay?

113
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,876
And we're about to take that straight at the end of this

114
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,709
so here we go.

115
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,058
You ready, three, two, one, go.

116
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:34,891
Mm.

117
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:37,363
My mouth's so full of them, I can't even talk.

118
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:39,113
- Okay, well, I mean.

119
00:03:40,283 --> 00:03:44,154
- We can have a lot of these, these are nothing.

120
00:03:44,154 --> 00:03:47,046
Next these are Warheads Extreme Sour candy.

121
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:47,879
(moans)

122
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,519
Oh, this does not look good. - Wait are they like

123
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,560
What are they, gum, is it gum?

124
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,643
- I don't think they're gum.

125
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:52,476
- Okay.

126
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:54,893
- Ready, three, two, one, go.

127
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:58,300
(grunts)

128
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,133
Oh my god.

129
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:04,086
(screams)

130
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:05,049
- My tongue.

131
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:07,216
(screams)

132
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:10,663
- Can't even walk right.

133
00:04:10,663 --> 00:04:12,488
- Oh, I have so much saliva in my mouth right now

134
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:13,713
it's not even funny.

135
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:14,717
My tongue.

136
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:16,268
My tongue - My tongue, it's like

137
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:18,101
I would say 80% gone now.

138
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,421
So we're gonna add just a few of these.

139
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,254
- Oh no.

140
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,013
- Well that's all of them.

141
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,461
(suspenseful music)

142
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:25,171
- PEZ SourZ.

143
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:26,504
- I didn't even know this was a thing.

144
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:28,401
The worst part about this challenge is knowing that

145
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,477
in a little bit, we're gonna have to drink this.

146
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:33,078
Think about our individual reactions so far

147
00:04:33,078 --> 00:04:36,453
to each one of these individually but all together.

148
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:37,416
Will we survive it?

149
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,419
- No, no, no, we won't.

150
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,992
- I'm just gonna take quite a few at once.

151
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:41,825
- Okay, me too.

152
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:43,646
- I don't, these might not be that bad though, we'll see.

153
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:44,479
Ready?

154
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,312
- Yeah.

155
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:51,655
- These are actually really good.

156
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:53,730
- I expected that, that's why I picked it, mm.

157
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,563
- Mm.

158
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:55,896
- They're good.

159
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,289
- That's what we just had.

160
00:04:58,289 --> 00:04:59,122
Thank you, PEZ.

161
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:00,609
Alright, let's dispense these in.

162
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:02,941
(suspenseful music)

163
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:04,156
This is straight lemon juice.

164
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:05,047
- Oh no. - It's called

165
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:05,982
Italian lemon juice.

166
00:05:05,982 --> 00:05:08,098
- I've experienced very bad situations with this.

167
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:11,110
I actually dared a friend to chug a whole thing

168
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,790
and ten seconds later he threw it all up.

169
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,278
- I say we'll go with the bubble gum instead.

170
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:17,435
Alright, here we go.

171
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,685
Three, two, one, go for it.

172
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:21,975
Oh my god.

173
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:28,189
(screams)

174
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,189
- Not again.

175
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:33,343
(screams)

176
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:34,343
- Oh my god.

177
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:38,951
- My god, my god.

178
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,878
- I can feel it hurt, it's still hurting (mumbles)

179
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:46,045
(screams)

180
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:50,544
(crying)

181
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,552
- [SpongeBob Narrator] Twenty minutes later.

182
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:56,067
- Dude.

183
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:56,900
- What?

184
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,825
- My voice dropped like a whole octave.

185
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,868
- When I was buying these, the lady was like

186
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:03,511
be very careful not to do more than one

187
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:05,820
because her boyfriend did one of them, and lost his

188
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,239
like legitimately lost his taste,

189
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,067
and we just did four of 'em.

190
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:10,900
- Wow we are freaking

191
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,483
- Is my tongue messed up?

192
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:13,441
- Yes.

193
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:14,371
Oh my god, it's all red.

194
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:15,277
(laughs).

195
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:16,300
What color is my tongue?

196
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,450
(laughs)

197
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,017
- It looks like a bird.

198
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:20,850
- So it looks like a peacock?

199
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,683
- [Collins] Yeah.

200
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:22,751
- Yes, that's what I wanted.

201
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:23,665
- Alright, here we go.

202
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:24,892
We're going for it because we love you guys.

203
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:27,459
There's one, that's all that's left right there.

204
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,459
- Sour Farts candy?

205
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,667
Wait, what?

206
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:30,832
- Did you fart the farts?

207
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:32,132
- It better not taste like farts.

208
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:32,975
I swear I'm gonna puke.

209
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,181
You have to go first on this one

210
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:36,780
'cause I'm not eating a piece of fart.

211
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,745
What is that smell?

212
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,356
Is that fart smell?

213
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,215
- It, oh my, okay.

214
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:42,978
It literally smells like a fart.

215
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:43,991
Let's give it a shot.

216
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:45,744
(screams)

217
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:46,884
- What, what?

218
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:49,064
- I can't tell if it's because my taste buds are gone.

219
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:50,200
(laughs)

220
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,976
- What it is, it's not that sour.

221
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,078
Because like at first, it was like (groans)

222
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:57,566
and now it's like (groans).

223
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,616
Alright so you get the honors of adding the fart candy

224
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:00,886
to the mix.

225
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,551
- Alrighty, here we go.

226
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:05,787
(suspenseful music)

227
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:06,667
(fart)

228
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,894
- I just wanna get it out of the way.

229
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,503
I wanna go with the smog balls.

230
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:10,336
- Okay.

231
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:11,205
- By Toxic Waste.

232
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:12,892
- Anything by Toxic Waste is not good.

233
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:13,885
- The difference with this one though is like

234
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:15,831
the outside looks smooth like a jelly bean

235
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:17,867
so I don't know how sour this is actually gonna be.

236
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:18,784
Here we go.

237
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,617
These taste good.

238
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:28,584
Shout out to you, Toxic Waste, for not killing me.

239
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:30,604
- Not as sour chewy center.

240
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:32,097
- We're gonna add these 'cause these are delicious.

241
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:32,930
(suspenseful music)

242
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,763
- I vote these.

243
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:36,026
- Yeah, 'cause after what Toxic Waste just didn't to.

244
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:36,859
I'm excited for these.

245
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:38,536
The green one looks pretty gnarly so we'll go with that one.

246
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:39,369
- Okay.

247
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:40,629
- Alright, here we go, three, two, one, break it in half.

248
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:41,705
- Oh it's kinda, oh there it is.

249
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:42,715
- Okay, here we go, you ready?

250
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:43,548
- Yeah.

251
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,451
- Oh my.

252
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:53,409
It really is shockingly sour.

253
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,492
(laughs)

254
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,752
- Oh god.

255
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:00,258
- My mouth is literally on fire right now.

256
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:01,737
- My tongue needs a massage.

257
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:03,638
Oh gosh, I am not looking forward to this,

258
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:04,832
this smoothie. - I am not.

259
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,076
- [Brent] At all.

260
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:07,298
(suspenseful music)

261
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:09,111
- There's one more Cry Baby?

262
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:10,333
- Oh no.

263
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,882
- I literally died.

264
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:15,287
So guys, I though that Toxic Waste was the most sour candy

265
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,844
I've ever experienced.

266
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:19,111
These Cry Babies are on another level.

267
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:20,490
These are actual tear drops.

268
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,348
I might cry.

269
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:23,015
Three, two, one, go.

270
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:26,950
I'm good. - Oh.

271
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:32,981
- I'm fine.

272
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,494
- It's fine, right?

273
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:35,327
- Oh yeah.

274
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,614
- I think my tongue is bleeding now.

275
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:38,991
I can taste the blood over the candy now.

276
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:41,074
(groans)

277
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:45,506
Should we add 'em?

278
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:46,645
- Uh-huh.

279
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:48,182
I am sweating bullets right now, man.

280
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:51,727
This is just extremely painful, alright.

281
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:52,595
Here we go. (suspenseful music)

282
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:55,402
- Extreme sour candy, savor the sweet.

283
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,407
- There's two packets open.

284
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:57,240
So we'll just go with these.

285
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,073
- Contains soy.

286
00:08:58,073 --> 00:09:00,446
- Contains soy. (laughs)

287
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:01,279
Cheers.

288
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:04,080
Wow.

289
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,413
Wow, wow, wow, wow, ooh wow.

290
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:12,279
Wow, oh my (screams)

291
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:22,210
- [SpongeBob Narrator] A few moments later.

292
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,383
- I need a second.

293
00:09:23,383 --> 00:09:24,732
- That was really bad.

294
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,725
- That was horrible.

295
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:30,264
Worst part now is I can feel little cracks in my tongue,

296
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:32,123
and like every time a sour candy goes in,

297
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:33,896
it just like seeps into those little cracks.

298
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:34,919
Okay, here we go.

299
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,127
Gotta man up, gotta add 'em in.

300
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:37,286
Here we go.

301
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,783
(suspenseful music)

302
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:40,420
We're saving the malic acid for the last one,

303
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,244
but right now, I say let's do a squirt of lemon juice.

304
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:44,077
- Okay.

305
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:45,647
I have a feeling that - This is gonna murder us.

306
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:46,735
- Oh, I know, it's gonna really.

307
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:47,765
- So I'll take a squirt first.

308
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:48,682
Here we go.

309
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:58,313
It actually taste delicious, after all the nasty stuff.

310
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:00,689
I'm not even kidding, that was amazing.

311
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:03,531
I need a little bit more.

312
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:06,663
I'm not even joking, this taste incredible right now.

313
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:07,496
- Same.

314
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:08,793
- I will add this liberally, bro.

315
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:09,626
(laughs)

316
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,751
This was, oh my gosh.

317
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:13,364
(suspenseful music)

318
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:17,408
- Supercharged chewy candy, Cry Baby Extra Sours,

319
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,046
and then we have the malic acid which is just

320
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:20,110
the hardcore stuff.

321
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,687
We're saving that for last, but right now.

322
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,020
Three, two, one.

323
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:26,772
I'm good.

324
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:30,321
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

325
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:35,904
(groans)

326
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,939
- It's just actual pain.

327
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:41,445
It always is.

328
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:42,816
The worst part about this is my teeth.

329
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:45,144
I know I'm gonna have a cavity after this, dude.

330
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,651
Like there's just no avoiding a cavity.

331
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:48,045
Alright, here we go.

332
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:49,202
- Uh.

333
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:50,256
- Here we go.

334
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:51,434
Oh, there's more.

335
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:53,343
Now that moment you've all been waiting for.

336
00:10:53,343 --> 00:10:55,237
Time for us to eat the malic acid

337
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,475
and please give this video a thumbs up

338
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:00,288
for the fact that our mouths are already dead.

339
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:03,327
And this is gonna be like the finishing shot right here.

340
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,125
Basically, I've heard that people take malic acid

341
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,549
for health reasons and what they will do,

342
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:09,720
it'll take like a half of tablespoon,

343
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,124
put it in a whole thing of water, and then drink it.

344
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:17,234
We're about to go full tablespoon, with no water so

345
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:18,347
- Oh no.

346
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:19,679
- Rest in peace, us.

347
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,164
- Looks like sugar, like it looks like

348
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:22,395
mm this will be delicious.

349
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:23,468
Alright, here we go.

350
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:24,487
Are you ready for this, bro?

351
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:26,569
Three, two, one, go.

352
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,736
(screams)

353
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:34,862
- Oh my god, I can't do it, I can't do it.

354
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:37,214
(screams)

355
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:39,180
My mouth came out firing.

356
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,102
(screams)

357
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:40,935
This is not

358
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:43,102
(screams)

359
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,968
- Hands down, the most sour thing I've

360
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:56,718
My mouth is numb, my mouth is literally numb.

361
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:01,417
(screams)

362
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,192
Oh my god, okay hold up.

363
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:07,192
That was hands down, the worst experience I have ever had

364
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:08,620
making a YouTube video.

365
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,044
And now we have to add this stuff to this drink.

366
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:12,211
I'm not hyped.

367
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:15,216
- Just a little bit.

368
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,651
Oh, okay that's good.

369
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:17,624
- That's good (suspenseful music)

370
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:19,057
Okay, so these are two of Brent's friends

371
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:21,106
and they did not believe us that this stuff

372
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:24,156
will destroy your life and so they wanted to give it a try

373
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:26,262
right now so we're like okay.

374
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:27,929
Three, two, one, go.

375
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:33,775
- No, no, don't spit it out, don't spit it out.

376
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:34,914
- Don't spit it out, don't spit it out.

377
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:36,159
- And now they know.

378
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,088
- Now they believe us.

379
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:37,921
- Now they know.

380
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:38,754
- Dude, look it, he's literally

381
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:39,587
- Oh my god.

382
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:40,420
- Oh my god, bro.

383
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,589
- Swallowed it, I swallowed it.

384
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:42,849
- You swallowed it? - Are you serious?

385
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:44,159
- Why would you swallow it? - What?

386
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,440
- [Collins] Are you okay, bro?

387
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,273
- Mhm.

388
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:47,106
(laughs)

389
00:12:47,106 --> 00:12:50,329
- Now we have officially constructed the most sour drink

390
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,658
in the entire world, about to blend this thing up,

391
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:57,132
and then drink it so let's do this.

392
00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:59,520
(groans)

393
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,353
- [Brent] That looks

394
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:01,436
- Oh my gosh.

395
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:04,516
Alright, well now the moment you've all been waiting for.

396
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:08,356
Time to drink these most sour drink in the entire world,

397
00:13:08,356 --> 00:13:10,401

398
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:11,935

401
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,156
Make sure you guys subscribe to this channel.

402
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,712
That'd really mean a lot, especially after

403
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:18,798
everything we've been through.

404
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,749
So right now, it's time to drink the most sour drink

405
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:22,809
in the entire world.

406
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,726
Three, two, one, cheers, go for it.

407
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:34,015
I drank it and in my stomach I feel it.

408
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,454
It's killing me.

409
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:37,456
I can get another drink, I can do this though, man.

410
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:39,623

411
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:51,880

412
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,047

413
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:57,430
- Here we go.

414
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:07,230
I can't do anymore, I'm in (screams).

415
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,144
