1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,799
(audience applause)

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:06,415
- Now, earlier today on Twitter I asked all my

3
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:08,547
fans what is like your favorite magic tricks I've

4
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:10,086
done during the season?

5
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:12,179
Now, the two most popular was the first one,

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,698
where I took the bill and made it appear

7
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:14,893
inside of a bag of popcorn,

8
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:16,801
and the second most popular was the book

9
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,444
trick I did in Vegas.

10
00:00:18,444 --> 00:00:20,069
So, tonight I thought it's my final show,

11
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:22,471
how bout I combine the two acts and try something new.

12
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,021
But of course to do this I need two very sexy assistants.

13
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:28,027
(audience screaming)

14
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,891
So, I thought...

15
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:32,830
Now I did have two very sexy ladies in mind,

16
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,687
Kathie Lee and Hoda.

17
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:35,995

- Uh huh, I got my eye on you.

38
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:11,299
- This is gonna be tricky. Okay. (giggles)

39
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,203
- No littering in New York.

40
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:15,216

41
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:16,301

- Hoda writes books like that.

86
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:11,359
- Quit it.

87
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:12,192

88
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:13,025
Okay, um.

89
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:16,750

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,509
- Alright, so I've got some just random bills here.

91
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,857

92
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:21,382
like difference serial numbers, right?

93
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:23,428

100
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:32,599
and your job, just whenever you want, say the word stop.

101
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,596

- Okay. This will be the bill. Take it.

105
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:40,236
Now, I want to show you, if you went one bill earlier

106
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:43,218
you would have got a completely different serial number.

107
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:45,282
One bill later a completely different serial number,

108
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:47,108
but you happened to get that one.

109
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:48,953
Alright, can you just show it to the camera really quick?

110
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:49,786
- Which one?

111
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:50,995
- Right over there.

112
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:53,046
Get a shot of that.

113
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:54,383
Oh great, and let me see the bill really quick.

114
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,412
I need to memorize it. Got it.

115
00:02:56,412 --> 00:02:57,412
Okay, great.

116
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:00,115
I'm gonna try and do some visualization now, so you guys,

117
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:01,941
I need to concentrate for this, alright? (giggles)

118
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:02,774
- Okay. - Okay.

119
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:03,607
- Here we go.

120
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:04,440
I'm just gonna close my eyes,

121
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,539
I'm gonna visualize taking the book,

122
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:07,625
tearing out page 60...

123
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,104
No no, sorry. 96 right, 96?

124
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:10,405

125
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:11,740
- Okay, turn that page 96,

126
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,122
writing the word sucking on it...

127
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:15,486
- [Hoda] Oh. (audience laughing)

128
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,319
- Turning it around, I'm gonna write down the serial

129
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,412
number on the back, and then insert it inside the

130
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:21,534
envelope that Kathie Lee is sitting on.

131
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,367
- No way. - Uh uh.

132
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,099
- Okay. I think I should have done this.

133
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,440
- Here. Can you please take the book,

134
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,072
and open up to page 96.

135
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:29,772
- This may take a minute. (audience laughing)

136
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:33,262
- You should have gotten younger models. (laughing)

137
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:34,494
- [Collins] (laughing)

138
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:36,164
(audience laughing and applauding)

139
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:37,908
- Oh my god. - Oh my.

140
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:38,741
- [Hoda] 96.

141
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,685
- Your one page has actually been torn

142
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:42,579
out of the book like that.

143
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,208
Alright, now Kathie, you've been sittin on top of that

144
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,041

145
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,192
Is that right?

146
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,705
- The entire time. And I have not done anything to it.

147
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,152
- Okay. Can you, uh... (audience laughing)

148
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:53,184
And I, I want to confirm, you never at any point felt my

149
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:55,186
hands go near you or the envelope.

150
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:56,269
- Oh honey, I would have felt that.

151
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,845
(audience laughing)

152
00:03:57,845 --> 00:03:58,936
- Well, you know what they say...

153
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:01,089
- And I would have been arrested. What are you 17?

154
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:02,356
- Well, you know what, yeah.

155
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:03,344
(everyone laughing)

156
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,663
- [Collins] It's a little bit illegal.

157
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:06,096
Um, well you know what they say,

158
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:07,031
magicians do have fast hands.

159
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:09,061
So, here. Can you please stand up for us?

160
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,129
- I've got a lot of stuff going on here Collins.

161
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:11,177

162
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:12,370
Okay, just take...

165
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,033
Alright, so here, we're just gonna take the envelope,

166
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:15,880

We'll try this. This is, um...

168
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:17,657
Let's see this.

169
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,693

170
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,796
- [Collins] Magic.

171
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:22,117
- [Kathie Lee] Are you watching closely?

172
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:23,076
- [Hoda] I am. I'm watching closely.

173
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:23,909
- Okay. Just like that.

174
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:24,911
Could you please open the envelope?

175
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,405
See, is there anything inside of it?

176
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,688
Just open it up.

177
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:29,521
Okay. You go it?

178
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:30,696
Yeah, is there anything inside?

179
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:32,345
- Oh my god.

180
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:33,983
- Is it your missing page?

181
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:34,816
- Oh my god.

182
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,649
