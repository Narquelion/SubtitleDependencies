1
00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:02,123
- Okay, that's it, Collins Keys,

2
00:00:02,123 --> 00:00:05,443
I'm roasting you and you are horrible.

3
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:08,212
And look atcha, you look like Donald Trump.

4
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:10,662
- (laughing) What?

5
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:12,210
- What's up it's Collins Key

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,555
and yes I know I don't normally upload

7
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,928
on a Sunday, but something happened

8
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:16,739
that I really need to address.

9
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,036
And I can't, it's been like weighing on me.

10
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:21,473
I can't just have this out there, I got roasted.

11
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:23,202
And no I didn't get roasted by Rice Gum.

12
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:24,558
I don't get roasted by Drameller.

13
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,875
No, it's the worst roast possible,

14
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,803
I got roasted by you guys.

15
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:31,907
Now granted, I did ask you guys to roast me.

16
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,689
There's three different rounds to this roast.

17
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:35,713
Round number one takes place on Instagram.

18
00:00:35,713 --> 00:00:37,416
Why I released this photo right here,

19
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,725
don't even ask why I released this photo.

20
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:40,463
And in the comments, you guys went in.

21
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:42,679
You guys were savages, you roasted me so hard.

22
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,837
Round number two takes place on Twitter.

23
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,417
I released this photo and fun fact,

24
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:49,871
I made that face on national TV on Cartoon Network.

25
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,046
My voice just cracked, that's how

26
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:52,230
embarrassed I was, it was terrible.

27
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,974
And round three is a dis track round on SnapChat

28
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:56,674
where I asked you guys on SnapChat

29
00:00:56,674 --> 00:00:58,844
to roast me with your very own original dis tracks.

30
00:00:58,844 --> 00:01:00,660
So that's round number three, we're gonna be going in.

31
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,954
I'm gonna need like ice, I'm gonna need aloe,

32
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:04,989
I'm gonna need water, I'm gonna need lotion,

33
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,354
I'm gonna need sunscreen, I'm gonna need everything.

34
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:08,298
Because I'm gonna be so burned

35
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,189
and roasted by the end of this video.

36
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:11,616

37
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,224

00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:16,948

Without any further adieu, right now,

60
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:55,621
let's jump in and yeah, get roasted.

61
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,831
Alright, round one is Instagram

62
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:58,358
and this is the photo that I posted.

63
00:01:58,358 --> 00:01:59,911
And I dressed up like this for

64
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,350
Harry Potter's book release because if you guys

65
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,213
have read the books, you know that wizards

66
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:04,201
when they try to dress as muggles, they're

67
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:05,446
not able to do it and they always

68
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:08,442
end up looking really crazy so that's what happened to me.

69
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:10,169
I'm so nervous, let's go to the Instagram comments.

70
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,546
Everything in that outfit is actual okay.

71
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:13,935
But what he forgot to wear is a bra.

72
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,890
I mean if you wear a pink top, you need to wear a bra.

73
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,794
Hey, you don't know I mighta been wearing,

74
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:21,190
what are they called training bras, I don't know.

75
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,703
I think if you added some bling around your neck

76
00:02:22,703 --> 00:02:26,870
and a big black shirt, you'll look exactly like Eminem.

77
00:02:28,768 --> 00:02:31,155
(laughing) That's not even, that's not even a roast on me,

78
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:33,435
that's a roast on Eminem, oh my gosh.

79
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:34,810
When you realize that you look so fabulous,

80
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,805
the modeling agency fired you (laughing) what.

81
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,451
When half of you wants to go swimming,

82
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,001
but the other half doesn't.

83
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:42,841
This picture reminds me of your first

84
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:47,104
musically, a complete disaster (laughing).

85
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:48,509
Yo, I thought my first musical was cool.

86
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:53,370
Those shorts are higher than Wiz Khalifa (laughing).

87
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,663
When a girl says she likes nerds, this isn't what she meant.

88
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:58,659
No one likes you, stop acting like you're perfect.

89
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:00,767
I hate you so much, look at yourself, you look

90
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:03,512
like a dork or an idiotic person.

91
00:03:03,512 --> 00:03:06,594
Go die somewhere otherwise you'll end up like Jacob S.

92
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:08,517
Like that stupid kid for asking something

93
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:11,767
stupid like your life, die Collins die.

94
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:18,844
I was expecting a roast, not like a death threat okay.

95
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:22,821
Your hairline looks like a bald eagle.

96
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:24,994
Why don't you slip into something a little

97
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:27,069
bit more comfortable like a coma.

98
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,417
Are you supposed to be Kylie Jenner with that pose?

99
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,834
Come on man, grow some balls.

100
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:35,890
America's got no fashion skills.

101
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:39,419
America's got no fashion skills, that was the show

102
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,073
I was on guys for those of you who are wondering.

103
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:43,602
Shine bright beautiful as you always are Collins,

104
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:45,632
no matter how you look or what you wear.

105
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:46,992
What a sense of style and then person

106
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:49,691
below was like, y'all suck at roasting.

107
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:54,147
Dude this is a game of where's Waldo with your muscles.

108
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:57,198
I was like 12 okay, I didn't have like any muscles.

109
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:59,590
Give one dollar a month to help this poor person

110
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,055
into buying two pairs of shoes that are the same.

111
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:05,851
Or donate a blue croc, this will help a lot.

112
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:09,182
I showed my dad this picture and he said that's a cute girl.

113
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,302
You look like where's Waldo so stop

114
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:12,719
acting like him and get lost.

115
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,876
Round two is Twitter and this is the photo

116
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:20,391
you guys are roasting me on, so you guys

117
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:21,927
thought the last round was intense.

118
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,482
This one, this one's gonna be

119
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:25,209
even worse, so yeah, let's get to it.

120
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:26,135
When you're trying to be cute because

121
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:30,710
you're failing badly with them caterpillar eyebrows.

122
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,389
(laughing) Oh my god do they look like caterpillars?

123
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:37,002
When diarrhea attacks, part one (laughing).

124
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:40,042
What is part two of diarrhea attacking?

125
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,216
It says your bottom lip looks like

126
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:43,114
it's trying to eat you top lip.

127
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:44,073
Alright this one is when Bob the Builder

128
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:47,176
tried drugs for the first time.

129
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,299
Oh my gosh, you look like a goose

130
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:50,469
who's ears are about to pop out

131
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:54,636
of your head (laughing), oh my this photo (laughing).

132
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:58,729
Shrek called and he wants his face back.

133
00:04:58,729 --> 00:04:59,991
You remind me of a creepy doll I once had

134
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:04,074
after my little cousin melted its face off, what?

135
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,383
Even Bob the Builder can't fix that face.

136
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:10,676
Oh my gosh, I see no difference.

137
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:13,009
That's cold, that's so cold.

138
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:15,684
Round three is SnapChat dis tracks.

139
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:16,708
This is obviously the one that

140
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,464
I'm the most nervous for cause I have

141
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:21,907
no idea what you guys are gonna say, so yeah, let's do it.

142
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:24,048
- Your hair actually looks like the tsunami

143
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:26,402
that hit Alaska ten years ago that killed

144
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:29,569
over 200,000 people, like please stop.

145
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:33,226
- Oh my gosh, (laughing) wow.

146
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:36,188
- You are just a lameo, a lameo bleep.

147
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:38,749
I'm sorry you are a lame bleep.

148
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:42,329
- Oh, gotta bleep all that out, holy cow.

149
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:44,069
- I think it's stupid man.

150
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,483
- The hair looks stupid okay.

151
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:48,064
- (Talking like a baby).

152
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:50,667
- (Laughing)

153
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,774
- [Contestant] Bigger than your lobes.

154
00:05:52,774 --> 00:05:54,845
Nose so big, big grape jelly is it

155
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:57,363
Collins Key or the Fruit Loop bird?

156
00:05:57,363 --> 00:06:01,530
- (Laughing) That was super like sneak dis right there.

157
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,784
Like you weren't even in the video.

158
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:08,423
- You're hair looks like a mushroom.

159
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:11,086
Your head looks like a mushroom.

160
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:13,836
- You look like a piece of shrimp

161
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:18,162
that sat on my table all day.

162
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:20,082
- (Laughing) what?

163
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:22,996
- Tell me why Collins Key look like Donald Trump's son?

164
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:27,163
- (Laughing) What, I'm waiting for a roast.

165
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,612
Out of all of them, that one hurt the most.

166
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:38,855
- Yo Collin, you gotta hit the weight room bud.

167
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:41,109
- Those traps are not gonna get

168
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,794

169
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:44,793
- Not gonna happen.

170
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:45,913
- (Laughing) Those traps are not gonna

171
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:48,035
get you to a million selfies, what are traps by the way?

172
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:49,385
Alright, I'm gonna stop right there.

173
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:51,271
That is definitely enough roasting for the day.

174
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:52,662
