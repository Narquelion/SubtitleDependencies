1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,747
- You challenged us to turn our house into a real

2
00:00:01,747 --> 00:00:02,672
life Candyland and were kicking it off with

3
00:00:02,672 --> 00:00:04,628
makin a candy garden. We've got a whole bunch of

4
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:07,003
melted down Gummy Bears in here that we're going

5
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:07,903
to be coating, here this one is you ready?

6
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:09,715
- You ready? Here we go

7
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:10,738
- [Both] 3,2,1

8
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:13,655
(glass shattering)

9
00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:18,170
- You blew it bro, are you kidding me?

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,057
- This is a college moment

11
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:21,334
- You got it on my face! It's gonna stain my nose.

12
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:24,124
- I know, we've got to get this off!

13
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,433
- That took forever to clean up and it has

14
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:27,938
literally stained everything.

15
00:00:27,938 --> 00:00:28,967
Got a new uh, a new gummy bear

16
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:29,800
- I do man

17
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,905
- What happened to your old one?

18
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,060
- It kind of popped in the process unfortunately

19
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,198
so now I've got the melted down Gummy bears

20
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:38,973
and I'm gonna fill in this giant Gummy bear.

21
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:41,043
- So now I'm gonna be making some soda soaked watermelon

22
00:00:41,043 --> 00:00:42,391
so basically you take a soda thing like this,

23
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:43,566
open up... no! No!

24
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:44,399
- Whoa, whoa!

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,331
- No! Get in there

26
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,164
- Wow!

27
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:47,208
- Basically the goal here is you want the soda

28
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,019
to soak all through the watermelon, really

29
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:50,507
permeate the juices.

30
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:52,957
- Wait, is this how we make a purple watermelon kong?

31
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:54,008
- Get it deep in there!

32
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:56,038
- Dude, you have to warn me!

33
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,376
- I don't have to warn you, Devan, it's not in

34
00:00:57,376 --> 00:00:58,209
the contract.

35
00:00:58,209 --> 00:00:59,797
- Well then, I don't have to make this really

36
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:00,826
cool Gummy bear tree.

37
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:01,677
- See this is different,

38
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:02,529
you don't make a cool gummy bear tree

39
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,331
you will get flamed in the comments.

40
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,693
So light this man up.

41
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:06,967
- I would not say that.

42
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,104
You might actually light me up in the comments.

43
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:10,612
- All right so don't light him up in the comments.

44
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,502
- All right so Collins I'm gonna need your help

45
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:14,117
to hold this gummy bear.

46
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,718
- Got up into the goop on my hands

47
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:17,570
so I can't quite put my gloves on properly.

48
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,403
Wanna drop it in?

49
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:19,236
- Yeah I'm ready man.

50
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:20,069
- Drop a load.

51
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:20,902
- Here we go.

52
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:21,735
(laughs)

53
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:23,133
- Yup! Yup there we go I'm doing a great job Devan.

54
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,166
Oh! Come on! Come on!

55
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,794
Think thin streams.

56
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:27,627
- I can't see it.

57
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:29,067
- It just drenched me dude.

58
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,573
I'm not doing as good a job.

59
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:31,406
- I think we got it man.

60
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:32,239
- All right.

61
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,254
- I'll help, I'll help.

62
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:36,326
All right well I just have to fill this thing up entirely,

63
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:38,917
and next up I'm making a strawberry but with an apple.

64
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,304
So let me do that and then I'll be right back.

65
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:42,237
- All right next we're gonna empty out the watermelon

66
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:43,180
and turn it sour.

67
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,048
- [Devan] All right I have everything I need

68
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:46,881
to turn these apples into strawberries.

69
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:49,576
I'm coating it in this nice melted chocolate here,

70
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,557
so I can attach these jolly ranchers.

71
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:52,453
- We're gonna use a drill here to

72
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:53,799
chop up the inside of the watermelon.

73
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,828
So here- this thing really scares me man.

74
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:57,853
Okay so here we go...

75
00:01:57,853 --> 00:01:59,936
(laughs)

76
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:02,669
- I feel like a rockstar in a way.

77
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:03,865
(laughs)

78
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:06,604
Wait what? What rockstar does that?

79
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:09,577
Oh! We blasted the ceiling bro look at that.

80
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:10,660
- We? We? We?

81
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:12,438
You and I?

82
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,799
- As a duo. As a dynamic duo.

83
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,380
- All right, so now, I have to attach

84
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,129
these jolly ranchers on the top.

85
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:18,962
- All right here we go,

86
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:19,795
so we're gonna take the chunks out

87
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:20,628
and just drop them in here.

88
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:22,076
Basically hollowing out the watermelon, (grunts)

89
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,376
it's not working.

90
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,209
- Whoa!

91
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,223
- Dude, look! It actually looks pretty cool. (light bang)

92
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,056
There we go!

93
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:28,131
It's going in here, flippin' scooping it out.

94
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,990
Scoop-da-da-doop

95
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,548
doo-doo-poo-poo-pa!

96
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:33,550
I gotta say I love being outside.

97
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,838
I am fully uninhibited to be my greatness. (splash)

98
00:02:35,838 --> 00:02:36,671
- Wow!

99
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:39,112
This literally feels no different than inside to me.

100
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:40,287
- Next up, it's time for me to make

101
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:42,048
the sour insides of the watermelon.

102
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,675
So, I melted down a whole bunch of

103
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:45,338
sour patch watermelon over here.

104
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:47,137
So now, I'm going to drench all the actual watermelon

105
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:48,498
in the sour patch watermelon.

106
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:50,348
- All right, so, I finally have half of it coated.

107
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:52,458
I separated some yellow "Nerds" here, and

108
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,230
these are gonna be the seeds of the strawberry.

109
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,803
- If you could just hold the actual watermelon for me

110
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:57,034
I'm gonna dump this in.

111
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:57,867
- I can.

112
00:02:57,867 --> 00:02:58,948
- So if you wanna grab the actual watermelon, it's

113
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:00,085
right over the-

114
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:00,956
- Yeah, okay. What?

115
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:01,789
- You checking your nails?

116
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,040
- This just in, YouTube star,

117
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,784
Devan Key checks his nails.

118
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,897
So lift up that water- holy cow, this is heavy.

119
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:07,730
- Ugh, this is heavy.

120
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,334
- All right, lot of heavy stuff.

121
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:10,167
- Is it going in?

122
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,000
- Yup! Oh, yup yup yup!

123
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,600
- Is it going in?

124
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,036
- It's splashing a little bit but it's going in.

125
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:14,987
It's very chunky are you supposed- th-th-that's it!

126
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,399
- Is it going in? Is it full?

127
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,232
- Pull back, pull back.

128
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:18,065
- It's full?

129
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:18,898
- Yes it's very full.

130
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:19,731
- Oh wow, that is very full.

131
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:20,564
The last thing you gotta do is

132
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:21,650
add a beautiful mirror glaze

133
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,783
to the exterior of my watermelon.

134
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:24,105
Let me grab that real quick.

135
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:24,938
(splatter)

136
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,771
- Ugh! Whoa whoa!

137
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:26,988
- I'm sorry I didn't mean that.

138
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:28,255
- Its all good.

139
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:29,806
- For the strawberry stem, I'm actually gonna use

140
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:30,684
these fruit roll-ups.

141
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:31,916
- Time to add a mirror glaze

142
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,575
it's gonna look so satisfying.

143
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:34,408
All right here we go,

144
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:36,325
- [Both] 3,2,1... Whoa!

145
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:40,509
- [Collins] Man!

146
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:41,342
- [Devan] Nice!

147
00:03:41,342 --> 00:03:42,175
- [Collins] Dude!

148
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:45,155
- [Devan] It looks so cool coming out of the container too.

149
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:46,989
- [Collins] It looks so beautiful!

150
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:48,180
All right, gloves are coming off.

151
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,013
So this thing now, just has to set here.

152
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:50,913
It's time to head back inside

153
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:51,789
to make the rest of the candy garden.

154
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:52,622
- Lets do it!

155
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:53,939
- We got all the elements for the edible garden.

156
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,939
Bro, that gummy bear, like, what happened?

157
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,113
It's very interesting.

158
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,525
- Bro, it's like 40 pounds.

159
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,259
- All right well here is the big reveal.

160
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:02,882
- [Both] 3,2,1.. TA DA!

161
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:04,612
- [Collins] Look at these, man!

162
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:05,851
These are just a few examples, of all the things

163
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:07,842
we're gonna be adding into the candy garden

164
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:09,107
for the massive candy room

165
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:10,722
and we'll be eating that at the end of the video.

166
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:11,776
For the next part of Candyland

167
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:14,111
it's time for us to make a real life edible candy circus.

168
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:15,560
We got the yeet hammer and a carnival game.

169
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,393
Let's give this a shot.

170
00:04:16,393 --> 00:04:17,439
(bell dings)

171
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,272
- Ah!

172
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:21,316
- And that is why I don't go to circuses man.

173
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:22,513
All right, right now, let's get into it.

174
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,209
To start off, I'm making a jello slushy.

175
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:25,647
Collins what is that? What is that?

176
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:27,184
No, no, no.

177
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,772
- I'm battering you up, Devan. You look great!

178
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:32,326
To be clear, I am making a funnel cake ice cream sandwich

179
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:33,952
so I put the batter here in this squirt gun.

180
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:35,235
- That wasn't clear at all. - That wasn't clear?

181
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:36,068
- No.

182
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,680
- All right. So right now, it is time

183
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,233
to make some funnel cakes for real though

184
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,475
so we're gonna place the safety glasses on.

185
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:43,145
- I got my hot jello here, I got some dry ice in here

186
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:45,036
so now I'm gonna pour that in here the goal is to freeze it

187
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:45,935
and make it look awesome.

188
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:46,768
- [Collins] That does look pretty awesome

189
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:47,796
the way it's just steaming up.

190
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:48,731
- And you're probably thinking

191
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:51,079
how on earth are you gonna make a jello slushy?

192
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,912
- Actually, Devan I was thinking

193
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:54,113
how on earth are you gonna make a jello slushy?

194
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:55,349
- Oh my gosh, I'm glad you asked!

195
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:56,182
- Don't touch me.

196
00:04:56,182 --> 00:04:57,015
(laughs)

197
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:57,848
- Let's keep it cordial.

198
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:58,681
- 6 feet distance.

199
00:04:58,681 --> 00:04:59,514
- 6 feet apart.

200
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:00,764
Not because of the quarantine,

201
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:02,118
there was another incident that happened.

202
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:02,951
- Yeah, it was that.

203
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:03,784
- Devan, get me down.

204
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:04,617
- Yeah.

205
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:05,757
- All right so here we go, I've got

206
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:06,590
a whole bunch of batter here in this

207
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,423
lovely cooking thing.

208
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:08,405
I don't know what the thing's called I don't garden.

209
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:10,066
So here we go, let's just do a little pour.

210
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:10,899
- [Both] Oh!

211
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:12,191
- That's hot!

212
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:13,108
- You're deep frying it.

213
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:14,383
- Yeah we're deep frying it!

214
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:15,216
That's how we make a funnel cake.

215
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:18,883
Just step back a little bit, and then just..

216
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:23,647
Ahhh, that's not good.

217
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:24,996
This is not good!

218
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:26,337
Turn this off real quick.

219
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:27,170
Also wanna mention

220
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,361
do not try this at home!

221
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,313
We are trained professionals.

222
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:31,314
- Well we're not trained. We're professionals.

223
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:32,147
- Yeah!

224
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:33,016
How's your jello slushy coming along?

225
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:33,849
- It's not going great

226
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:34,682
but it's gonna work, you know?

227
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:35,515
It's gonna work.

228
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:36,348
- So I'm actually just gonna pull it out

229
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:37,181
I'm not even gonna flip it

230
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,014
cause that would be a terrible idea.

231
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,421
Then underneath it that thing's resilient, BOOM!

232
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,709
- Wow! That's cool!

233
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,542
- Funnel cake!

234
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,712
- Whoa, look at this dude, it's bubbling up!

235
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:45,234
- [Collins] It's just a couple bubbles man.

236
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:47,010
- It was cool! I mean, come on.

237
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,214
It had no bubbles before, and then it had bubbles.

238
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:50,047
That's cool.

239
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:51,988
(applause)

240
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:54,468
- [Collins] Next up, gonna make some colorful funnel cake.

241
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:55,301
Whoa yeah!

242
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,358
- Whoa yeah!

243
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:58,439
- Okay well there we go we've got color number 1.

244
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,331
We're gonna go two colors simultaneously, BOOM!

245
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:01,934
- [Devan] You've got it too high again bro.

246
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:03,581
- Yeah I got it just a smidge high.

247
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:04,431
- I think that's too much, bro.

248
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,530
I think that is way too much.

249
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,209
- Purple protestants.

250
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,547
- No dude! I think that's too much!

251
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:09,547
- Yeah I guess you're right, here I go.

252
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:10,859
Purple from a distance, BOOM!

253
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:11,692
- Yeah I guess you're right,

254
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:12,525
let me just do it anyway.

255
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:13,988
- All right that's definitely a great band name.

256
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:15,207
Purple... from a distance.

257
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:17,138
- They only sell back row seats.

258
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:18,913
- Fun fact, they're actually back there.

259
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,303
You zoom in, at a distance.

260
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:22,079
Time to get out my second funnel cake

261
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,509
I don't know if you can call this, like, a funnel cake.

262
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,074
It looks more like, just like a patty almost.

263
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:26,516
Oh! Yeah it's crumbling.

264
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,380
- [Devan] That is a little bit weird.

265
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,213
- Gonna move it down over here like this.

266
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:30,412
Let's see it does a little plop, okay,

267
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:31,245
there we go!

268
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:32,212
Funnel crumble.

269
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:33,599
The first part of my ice cream sandwich is done.

270
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,204
So funnel cake. And now it's time to make some

271
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,608
delicious popcorn, that's gonna go around

272
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:37,574
the outside of the ice cream.

273
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:38,929
All right so we've got the funnel cake right here

274
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:39,804
I've got the popcorn which will be kind of like

275
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:40,888
the topper on top of it.

276
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:42,654
I filled up the super soaker

277
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:43,765
with a whole bunch of ice cream.

278
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:45,089
You wanna feel it, to confirm it's cold?

279
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:45,993
- It is cold.

280
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:48,040
- All right so here's the deal

281
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,873
we're gonna add the ice cream on here

282
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:50,285
because that's how they do it

283
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,118
at all circuses and carnivals.

284
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:51,951
So here we go

285
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:52,784
- [Both] 3,2-

286
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:53,617
- Wait 3 second like challenge

287
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:54,450
we want you to like this video

288
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,283
in 3 seconds, you ready?

289
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:56,116
Here we go

290
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,062
- [Both] 3,2,1, done!

291
00:06:58,062 --> 00:06:59,728
3, 2, 1

292
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:00,714
(spits)

293
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:03,990
- Holy cow, it got the squeaks!

294
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,823
- Oh, oh there's something hanging out of it.

295
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:05,986
Oh jeez.

296
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:07,983
- Think if it was chocolate ice cream

297
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:09,504
that would be uh, that would be a little bit bad.

298
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:11,085
- Well I need to pour this cereal

299
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:12,571
into the liquid nitrogen here.

300
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:14,827
The reason this is called dragon's breath

301
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,533
cereal is because when you put it in your mouth-

302
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:17,366
- Whoa!

303
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:18,800
(buzzer)

304
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,374
(laughs)

305
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,977
- Let me try it again, let me try it again.

306
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:22,810
- [Both] 3,2,1

307
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,208
(suspenseful music)

308
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,534
- Oh! There you go!

309
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:27,028
Yeah! There you go!

310
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:28,208
All right well I've got the actual tub

311
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,041
of ice cream here so now its time to add

312
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,400
all the actual ice cream.

313
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,105
Oh man this is a weak little thing.

314
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:34,620
- So this was my topper to my slushy so I'm gonna-

315
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,553
what are you doing?

316
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:36,429
- I'm doing it with my hands.

317
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:37,865
- Well I'm gonna take this here

318
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:38,698
and I'm gonna pour this

319
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:40,541
- Ow! Finger freeze!

320
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,832
- [Devan] Just look at this though.

321
00:07:42,832 --> 00:07:43,885
- My hands so cold!

322
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:45,094
I look at that and it kind of triggers me

323
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:46,189
because my hands are so cold at the same time

324
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:47,022
that that's so cold.

325
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:48,582
- This is definitely colder than your hand, Collins.

326
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:49,415
I can tell you that.

327
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:50,248
(groans)

328
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:51,081
- You wanna feel my hand?

329
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:51,914
- I don't.

330
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,541
It is time to deep fry some twinkies

331
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,374
and some snickers.

332
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,539
- All right so speaking of stuff that's been fried

333
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:56,700
I've got my funnel cakes over here.

334
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,217
I'm gonna pop this on top of the ice cream.

335
00:07:58,217 --> 00:07:59,050
- Dude, that got soggy.

336
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,273
- Yeah it did. - That got a little soggy.

337
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:01,843
- I don't need you to rub it in Devan.

338
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:03,159
So here's the thing, I've also got my popcorn.

339
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,534
- That got soggy.

340
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:05,856
- This cuts me at a very deep level it hurts.

341
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,709
All right so gonna add some popcorn down over here.

342
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,383
All right here we go gonna pick it up like this

343
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:10,216
and then,

344
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:12,767
(chuckles)

345
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:13,601
Those weren't even any words.

346
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,167
So we're gonna take this we're gonna pack it

347
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:16,327
on the outside over here like this

348
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:17,627
and again this is gonna be for my freak shake

349
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:19,201
because Devan's making his own freak shake.

350
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,605
My freak shakes gonna be even freakier than Devan's.

351
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:23,422
- Nah no chance.

352
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:24,440
- Yeah man got the freakiest of the freak shakes

353
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,811
it's gonna be freaky fresh.

354
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:27,312
- Well mine's gonna be freaky!

355
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:28,474
- Mine's gonna be FREAKY!

356
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,625
- Well mine's gonna be FREAKY!

357
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,833
- Mine's gonna be

358
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,666
(screeching)

359
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,499
- Now that I've got my twinkies

360
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:33,539
and my snickers all skewered

361
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,955
I'm gonna dip it into this colored batter here

362
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:36,918
so, BOOM!

363
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:38,177
- And now, I deep fry it!

364
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:39,457
Look at that, man! Look at that!

365
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:40,865
Where'd you go?

366
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:41,698
- I just got a little scared cause like

367
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:42,964
you stuck it in the oil right when I arrived.

368
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:44,969
I've got a large chunk of ice here

369
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:46,644
we're gonna be setting this down.

370
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:48,335
I've also got some dry ice

371
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:50,274
using some shaved ice as the base of my freak shake.

372
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:52,760
So I've gotta shave up some ice now.

373
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,201
Are those the twinkies?

374
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,428
- These are the snickers in the funfetti.

375
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:57,119
- Oh, dude, that's gonna like melt the chocolate.

376
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,510
Oh! that actually sounds lowkey really delicious.

377
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,343
- Uh huh.

378
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:01,490
- [Devan] Turn the ice upside down

379
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,856
it looks like he has hair now.

380
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:04,300
- I think its the dry ice it, like,

381
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,372
froze all the water around it.

382
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:08,449
So now let's get some shaved ice.

383
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:11,694
3,2,1. I've been waiting to use this thing

384
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:13,332
- Oh yeah!

385
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:16,271
- All right here we go, 3, 2, 1 OH!

386
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:18,846
- My feet are cold, it got on my feet.

387
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:21,326
- Well that definitely got us some shaved ice man.

388
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,295
I even looked away, I couldn't look.

389
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:25,128
I was like it's gonna be too crazy.

390
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:26,397
- Look at this bro, it's totally different

391
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:27,230
than what you're doing.

392
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,237
But its very cool stuff.

393
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:29,070
- Is it a glaze?

394
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,903
- Yes, here we go.

395
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,486
- [Both] 3,2,1.. OH!

396
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:35,395
- Awe man!

397
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:36,228
- Yeah!

398
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:37,251
- Maybe go back over it a little bit.

399
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:39,602
You probably shouldn't actually listen to me

400
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:40,552
cause I'm terrible at this kind of stuff but-

401
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,129
- [Devan] Whoa!

402
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:43,924
- [Collins] Whoa! That looks awesome dude that's sweet!

403
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:45,988
- I am very proud of myself, this looks awesome.

404
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:47,988
- I did have a small suggestion that could've helped out

405
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,612
- Good job.

406
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:50,445
- Thank you very much.

407
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:51,278
- All I gotta do is just collect

408
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:52,191
a bunch of the shaved ice I made

409
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,396
with my giant yeet hammer and then

410
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:54,789
that'll be the base of my freak shake.

411
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:56,073
Then I gotta add some flavoring to it.

412
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:58,163
All right time to make the flavor for my shaved ice.

413
00:09:58,163 --> 00:09:59,796
- [Devan] My trusty steed has arrived.

414
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:01,138
- You're your own trusty steed?

415
00:10:01,138 --> 00:10:03,093
- These are my trusty steeds Collins.

416
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:04,343
- Ah, yes. Very reliable.

417
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:05,364
- These legs don't need any steed.

418
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:06,983
- I'm making a straw man barbell

419
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:09,210
and I'm using these for the weights on either end.

420
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,043
What are you doing?

421
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,387
- I'm making the flavor for my freak shake, man.

422
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:12,333
My freaky shake.

423
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,297
- [Devan] So I have some royal icing here

424
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:15,975
that I'm gonna fill, oh, that's cool!

425
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:17,848
And this is gonna get really hard and solid,

426
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:19,457
sorry Collins were you trying to say something?

427
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:20,290
- Yep!

428
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,123
The blueberries are n the cloth right now

429
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:22,900
and not it's time to get the juice out

430
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,832
and this is gonna be the flavoring.

431
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,665
So here we go.

432
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,226
(grunts)

433
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,355
- You're leaking so much of it, man!

434
00:10:28,355 --> 00:10:29,188
- I know!

435
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:30,152
- All right now time to smash the berries

436
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:31,791
let's go: 3,2,1, AH!

437
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,002
There we go!

438
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:33,835
- [Devan] Look at that!

439
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:35,190
- [Collins] This is totally failing.

440
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,519
That's actually really awesome dude!

441
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,151
I'm actually very much into this right now

442
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:40,724
that's gonna be absolutely delicious.

443
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,102
- Well I need to make one more of these

444
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:43,373
and this is totally not working so I'll be right back.

445
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,410
- All right while he does that we're gonna add

446
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,225
the raspberries in here cause the show don't stop.

447
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:50,009
Just squeeze these in here, oh man!

448
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,145
All right for the topping I have some

449
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:54,263
condensed milk here which should freeze on impact.

450
00:10:54,263 --> 00:10:55,096
- [Devan] Oh yeah!

451
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:55,929
- Oh!

452
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:58,667
- [Devan] That was like one of your greatest creations.

453
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,981
- How is it, that right when I'm about to

454
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:02,735
get something that looks cool

455
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:03,831
I screw it up.

456
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,710
- Well I made two of these things

457
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,141
and then I also made this nice taffy

458
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:09,175
candy cane right here.

459
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:10,008
- Taffy?

460
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:11,192
- Yeah and if you look at it

461
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:12,053
it's like a barbell.

462
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:13,844
Next up I have to glaze it. You ready?

463
00:11:13,844 --> 00:11:15,350
You ready? Here we go, 3, 2, 1

464
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,183
- Oh that's gonna look so nice!

465
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:18,769
- Oh it's like a hydro-dip, an edible hydro-dip.

466
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:20,519
Spin it, lift it, OH!

467
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,332
- I'm out! I'm done!

468
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:26,426
- Look at that thing.

469
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:27,259
- I'm outta here.

470
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,339
- Are you actually leaving?

471
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,861
- Well we have to take a- AH COME ON!

472
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:31,958
Come on!

473
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,328
- I'm so sorry for you.

474
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:34,492
- It just squeezed out all the pulpiness.

475
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:35,793
I'm gonna find a way to fix this but I think

476
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:36,717
we've got everything we need

477
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:37,855
for a candy circus.

478
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,002
We've got all the circus candy and these

479
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:40,630
turned out absolutely amazing.

480
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,463
- Oh yeah.

481
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:42,585
- These look so delicious, dude.

482
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:44,319
- Your freak shake looks incredible I have to say.

483
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,235
- It's freaky for sure, and so is yours man

484
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:47,120
plus the barbell.

485
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,512
Everything is on point so here is the big reveal.

486
00:11:49,512 --> 00:11:50,784
- [Both] 3,2-

487
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:52,123
- 5 second subscribe challenge

488
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:53,518

489
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:57,172

Ready? Here we go

491
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:01,704
- [Both] 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

492
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:02,910
done!

493
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,760
- If you were able to do that

494
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,601
comment right now Keyper Squad and let's see

495
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:06,434
how these look.

496
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,795
- [Both] 3, 2, 1.. TA DA!

497
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,432
- [Collins] Yeah these freaky shakes!

498
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:11,378
We're gonna be adding these

499
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:12,428
to the massive candy room

500
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:14,025
and eating it all at the end of the video.

501
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,360
- Next up I am making the flower to my lily pad

502
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,872
but first I need some strawberries.

503
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:19,931
- Fresh back from the market

504
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:20,764
with a cart full of strawberries.

505
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:21,597
- Are you kidding?

506
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:22,628
Those were over there!

507
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:23,777
Why did you grab this?

508
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:24,610
- And scene.

509
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,472
Here's what we're gonna do Devan.

510
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:26,883
We're gonna get a close up shot of the cart,

511
00:12:26,883 --> 00:12:27,914
it's moving at lightning speed.

512
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,823
It hits a bump, oh no! Strawberries flying!

513
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,885
Smeared on the ground! Who's in the cart?

514
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:33,828
Tiny Devan!

515
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:34,911
- No! Not me!

516
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:38,572
- First thing I've gotta do for my edible rock

517
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:40,139
is use these 3 musketeers bars.

518
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,732
Three. Musket. Tears.

519
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:43,391
The goal here is to separate the chocolate

520
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,544
from the moo-sket.

521
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:45,530
(record scratch)

522
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,363
Nougat.

523
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:47,901
And that's again for the edible rock

524
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:48,924
so here we go. Oh, that's actually kinda-

525
00:12:48,924 --> 00:12:51,290
- Wait, you're making edible rocks with a koi pond?

526
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,424
- Yeah. - Nice, all right.

527
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:53,976
- Why'd you start off laughing at me man?

528
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:55,546
- Well I just didn't think you were serious.

529
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:57,908
- Does this face look not serious to you?

530
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:59,192
- What are you doing?

531
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:00,580
- I don't know.

532
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,942
- [Devan] All right I've got my strawberries cut up

533
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:02,775
and now I have to mash them.

534
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:04,052
- All right guys time to separate the nougat.

535
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:05,382
I've gotta say, it doesn't- hey.

536
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:06,427
Don't be touching my nougat.

537
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:08,882
If you take away the squareness of it-

538
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:10,016
- Order!

539
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:12,386
Order in the court!

540
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:13,219
- You're smashing some berries!

541
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:14,968
- I am, but I'm also calling order in the court.

542
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,049
- This is for your ice cream?

543
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:17,760
- Yes, I'm adding this in here.

544
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,853
It's actually for my lily pad-

545
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:20,104
- [Collins] Whoa! -[Devan] What?

546
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:22,681
- Strawberry juice. What-t-t-t

547
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:24,977
are you planning on doing with that strawberry juice?

548
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:25,810
- Putting it in here.

549
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,643
- No give it to me.

550
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:27,476
- No.

551
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:28,316
- Devan give it to me.

552
00:13:28,316 --> 00:13:30,699
Devan look at this, if I take this one nougat

553
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:31,937
- Why are you so amazed by this?

554
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,250
- Oh no. - Yes.

555
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,083
- Oh don't tell me.

556
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:34,916
- You know where it's going.

557
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:35,749
- I do.

558
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,773
It's a massive log.

559
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:40,601
- You can't deny the logness of this log.

560
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,066
- I can't. Nor do I want to.

561
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:44,098
- Exactly, so here the deal, with this log

562
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:45,805
you can do things like poke Devan in the ear

563
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:46,737
- No!

564
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:48,160
- It made slight contact.

565
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,423
- First I need to add some milk

566
00:13:49,423 --> 00:13:50,439
so I'm gonna do that.

567
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,856
I need to turn this blender thingy on, the mixer.

568
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:56,312
Collins be careful, we have real liquid nitrogen right here.

569
00:13:56,312 --> 00:13:58,555
- Oh snap! You gonna make ice cream!

570
00:13:58,555 --> 00:13:59,388
- Yes!

571
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:00,684
- Don't try this at home by the way.

572
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:02,089
- Do you have anything else to say Collins?

573
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:02,922
(laughs)

574
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:03,755
- Carole Baskins.

575
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:04,588
- Okay.

576
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:07,166
- [Collins] I'm very scared. No! That's not working!

577
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:07,999
- [Devan] Yes it is.

578
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:09,275
- What are you talking about Devan?

579
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:10,216
- Leave bro.

580
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,049
- I don't.

581
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:12,422
- Hey! That's starting to look

582
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:13,339
real weird.

583
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,043
- Don't look at it right now.

584
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:17,027
- [Collins] I'm looking at it and it scared me.

585
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:19,100
- Give me like 2 hours and I'll get it right.

586
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,933
- I've seen some things.

587
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:22,393
- Oh yes bro, look at this!

588
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:23,329
- I mean it is kind of cool

589
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,882
you used liquid nitrogen to make ice cream from scratch

590
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:26,182
but now, it's time for me to turn

591
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,410
this little ball into a rock.

592
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,348
Here we go.

593
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:29,373
Reverse wand!

594
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:30,669
- I have some marshmallow fluff

595
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,594
and I'm making the bowls that the ice cream

596
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:36,327
is gonna go in, for the bulb of the flower, of the lily pad.

597
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:39,008
- I'm pretty sure I misheard you there, you're doing what?

598
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:41,191
- So I'm making the bulb of the flower,

599
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:43,633
for the lily pad, and I'm making a bowl

600
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,966
that this ice cream goes in.

601
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:48,116
- Yeah I'm thoroughly lost.

602
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:49,804
- Now I combine the marshmallow fluff

603
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:51,393
with these fruity pebbles right here.

604
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:52,445
- Hold up the fruity pebbles man.

605
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:53,532
Batter up!

606
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:55,355
(laughs)

607
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:56,955
- You lost it it's over there.

608
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:57,927
- I lost my rock. Truce, bam.

609
00:14:57,927 --> 00:14:59,279
- Its a little...

610
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,238
- Is it the marshmallow fluff?

611
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:01,071
- It is.

612
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:03,387
- You just gotta do a magic trick.

613
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:05,227
- I don't do magic tricks anymore.

614
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:06,060
- What do you mean?

615
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,893
- I'm a youtuber now.

616
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:10,135
All right here we go so we're gonna charge up,

617
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:10,968
3, 2, 1,

618
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:13,252
(crashing)

619
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:15,774
- Hey it worked! We're detached.

620
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:18,660
- (groans) but at what cost?

621
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,018
- Don't worry I saw it in a marvel movie so it

622
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:21,851
can't be that bad right?

623
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:22,914
- What is this doing here?

624
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,755
- That's just my log. Probably shouldn't touch that.

625
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:25,588
- Are you sure that's not mine.

626
00:15:25,588 --> 00:15:26,628
- You might've lost it in flight.

627
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:29,208
- [Devan] So now I've got the fruity pebbles here.

628
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,844
- [Collins] And its time for me to coat this again

629
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:31,777
in chocolate.

630
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:32,952
We're gonna pop this into the fridge

631
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:34,098
it's gonna mold it a little bit better

632
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:35,592
and then it's on to the next part of the koi pond.

633
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,361
- Lots of dough! What were you about to say?

634
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:38,806
- I was gonna say the first thing I'm making

635
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:40,808
for my giant oreo is the filling on the inside.

636
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:43,566
Got some dry ice here as well as a slab of marble.

637
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:44,891
While I've got the filling contained

638
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:46,208
in this here siphon.

639
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,181
So this time I'm gonna do this

640
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,808
suspended, mission impossible style.

641
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:50,365
(hums mission impossible)

642
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,190
- You have socks on dude! What are you doing?

643
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,891
- Whoa! If I wasn't here it would've been all over me.

644
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:56,724
- Yeah like me.

645
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:59,634
- Yeah. Surprise innovation! I'm just ahead of my time.

646
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:01,826
All right so here we go we're just gonna get- oh!

647
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,284
Look at that ice cream bro look at that!

648
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:04,125
- That's awesome.

649
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,402
- Game changing, man.

650
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:07,219
Oh this is gonna be so delicious.

651
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:08,531
- Well I've got this all rolled out and now

652
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:11,394
I've made some stencils here for the lily pad.

653
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:14,644
Just gonna kinda cut this out here. Oh!

654
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:17,999
- [Collins] That looks really good man.

655
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,927
- [Devan] Yes! And for the next part of the lily pad

656
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:22,711
I made a smaller outline here, cut it out, then

657
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,664
gonna fill it with these jolly ranchers.

658
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:27,104
- Next up time to make the cookie part of the oreo.

659
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:27,937
So we've got the dough over here

660
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:29,469
we've got some 7-up as a rolling pin.

661
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:30,302
- Wait what? What's the oreo for?

662
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:31,514
- Sorry I should've mentioned

663
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:33,405
the oreos actually gonna be like stepping stones

664
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:34,562
leading up to the koi.

665
00:16:34,562 --> 00:16:36,363
So when we fill up the whole room-

666
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,299
- Whoops, you need some flour.

667
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,132
- Yeah you're very right

668
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:39,662
- Here you go, I just did this.

669
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:41,071
- Here we go, let's see if we just did this.

670
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:42,770
- That's not some flour.

671
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,603
- That's a little bit of flour.

672
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,806
- Not some flour!

673
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:45,639
- Yeah!

674
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,570
- You just gotta roll it out. Calmly! Calmly!

675
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,040
- This is calm! - No it's not!

676
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,921
(glass breaks)

677
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:54,671
- Are you kidding me?

678
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:56,752
- I'm sorry.

679
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:58,224
Here we go, gonna plop this down in here like that.

680
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,057
Hey look, we're twins!

681
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:01,619
- We're doing the same exact thing, we're not twins though.

682
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:02,452
What are you doing?

683
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:03,285
- Double high-fiving.

684
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:04,499
- This is a lot of status here.

685
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:05,553
- A lot of status?

686
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:08,007
- Yeah, this is how you achieve clout.

687
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,545
So I'm just gonna pop these things into the oven.

688
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:10,724
- Yeah okay hold on, hold on!

689
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:12,405
- I wait for no one!

690
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:14,842
- Hold on! We're gonna do it together.

691
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:17,009
- Okay here we go, why did you, you went in first?

692
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,070
How rude!

693
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,238
- Perfect!

694
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,988
- Gonna pop these in.

695
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:26,248
- All right so we got these things out of the oven.

696
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:28,102
- There we go, fully got them

697
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:29,347
and they are now exposed.

698
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:32,062
- And these are actually two halves of one lily pad.

699
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:32,895
- What are you doing?

700
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:34,901
- I'm using a ouija that you usually use

701
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:35,734
to clean your window.

702
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:37,035
I'm repurposing it to use it for my oreos.

703
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,798
- Squeegee bro not ouija.

704
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:39,749
- It's not a ouija?

705
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:40,582
- I don't think so.

706
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:41,415
- I think its a ouija.

707
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:42,447
- I'm pretty sure it's a squeegee.

708
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:44,031
- We got all the elements let's see how this looks.

709
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,856
Here is the big room reveal, let's see,

710
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,393
- [Both] 3, 2, 1... TA DA!

711
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:50,476
- [Collins] Look at this!

712
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:53,200
Hands down the craziest thing we have ever done.

713
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,710
- I feel like I'm in a dream right now, dude, holy cow.

714
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,567
- Dude its all edible like literally we can eat everything

715
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:00,941
from the rocks to the grass.

716
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:01,774
- I know.

717
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:02,975
- Next we have time to harvest the fruits

718
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:04,215
of our labor from our candy garden.

719
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,051
- Oh yes!

720
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,736
These strawberries need to be freed,

721
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,286
these carrots are in captivity.

722
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:09,119
- [Devan] What do you mean?

723
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:09,952
- In this cage so...

724
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,070
- This is a fence.

725
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,087
- Sweet tricks.

726
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:13,878
- No. No collins! Stop!

727
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:17,778
- That's on you man I was doing sweet tricks.

728
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:20,097
First lets pop this little rose right outta here

729
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:20,930
so, Devan.

730
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,763
- Wait I need mine.

731
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:22,597
- No, no, no, no, no.

732
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:24,343
I'm the bachelor, you're the lady on the show.

733
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:25,673
Do you accept my final rose?

734
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:26,816
- I think they do it on the bachelor

735
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:27,709
and the bachelorette.

736
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:30,728
- I'm the bachelor I'm not the bachelorette clearly.

737
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:32,912
- Well in that case I'm also the bachelor.

738
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:33,745
- Do you accept my final rose?

739
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,437
- No will you accept MY final rose?

740
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:36,396
- Do you accept MY final rose?

741
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:37,928
- I think you wanna choose mine.

742
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:39,557
- Think you want this rose right here.

743
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:42,474
This rose. Will you accept my rose?

744
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:48,161
All right lets just take a bite of it 3, 2, 1

745
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:48,994

747
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:54,040
- Wow!

748
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,537
- What would've happened?

749
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:56,407
- I need some sprinkles.

750
00:18:56,407 --> 00:19:01,234
- Wow. 10/10 phenomenal man, I accept this rose.

751
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:02,478
- You gotta try the rock.

752
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:04,392
- Oh yeah, this is kinda like take it and break it so,

753
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:05,708
(glass breaks)

754
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,119
I forgot that's glass!

755
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,765
- That's our table bro!

756
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:11,323
- I'm an idiot.

757
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:13,725
- Just eat it I wanna try this.

758
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:15,319
- Did you just take a bite of that thing?

759
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,152
- Mhmm.

760
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:17,115
- Your teeth are stronger than glass.

761
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:17,948
- There you go.

762
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,613
- Yeah see there's layers to this on the inside

763
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:21,446
so here we go,

764
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:22,857
I'm gonna take my bite over here from this wack lump.

765
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:25,628
(laughs)

766
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:28,709
- I mean this is actually very good.

767
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,579
- He next thing we gotta eat of course

768
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:31,759
are these delicious edible strawberries.

769
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,552
- Here's the thing, I appreciate the attention to detail

770
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,946
we put in it, it looks like its growing from the ground.

771
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:36,779
- We? We?

772
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:37,995
- Well you kinda helped with some of the stuff.

773
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:40,291
- What? I made this entirely.

774
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,408
Rewriting history, see how it is.

775
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:43,464
- It is what it is.

776
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:47,180
- So here we go, take a- pluck a strawberry.

777
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,023
- [ Both] 3, 2, 1

778
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:51,354
- That's what I thought would happen.

779
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:53,953
- Soft ground Collins, soft ground.

780
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:55,536
- Okay there we go!

781
00:19:57,248 --> 00:19:58,081
- Mmm! That's so good!

782
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:58,944
(chokes)

783
00:19:58,944 --> 00:19:59,805
- I'm good.

784
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:01,054
I don't think we've done enough damage

785
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:01,887
here at the candy gardens so now

786
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:02,912
we're onto the next part.

787
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:03,745
Sorry man.

788
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:04,664
Let's put this worm back in the dirt

789
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:05,497
and let's eat some more candy.

790
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,482
- I've had my eye on this giant gummy bear

791
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:08,538
from the very beginning.

792
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:10,448
It looks so good man!

793
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:11,833
- He looks good to you collins?

794
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,458
- Yeah well I- he looks a little funky.

795
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,886
- He is a little messed up, his face is all like,

796
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:16,432
squished in.

797
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:17,998
Okay hold on, here, here , here.

798
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:18,831
- [Collins] He's heavy!

799
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:20,331
- [Both] Oh! Whoa!

800
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:23,836
- Mission disaster, we lost an arm!

801
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:24,708
- This thing is so heavy.

802
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,133
- I'm telling you bro it's super heavy.

803
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,922
- All right you gotta just go for it. Ready?

804
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:29,922
- 3, 2, 1...

805
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,263
- Oh!

806
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:34,539
- Okay you gotta give me a little warning.

807
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:38,956
- I don't know what to say, tastes like a gummy bear.

808
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:43,987
- Lets not put the slo-mo. No slo-mo, no slo-mo!

809
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:45,049
(distorted voices) Will you accept my rose?

810
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:46,395
Are we married now?

811
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:48,489
- Guys its time to try the sour watermelon

812
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:49,452
so I think we go in with a hand

813
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,286
and just scoop it out.

814
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:51,164
- Wait for real?

815
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:52,251
- Kinda like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

816
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,354
- [Both] Oh!

817
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:54,818
- All right I got my handful you wanna go in?

818
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:55,728
- [Devan] Uh kind of.

819
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:58,145
- [Collins] Go for it! Ready?

820
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,908
- [Both] 3, 2, 1... OH!

821
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:03,523
- It's sour!

822
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,903
- That is sour! Ugh!

823
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:08,360
We've got way too many good things in this room

824
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,233
so let's move on.

825
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:10,329
- Yeah let's move on quickly.

826
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:12,387
Time to eat the freak shakes. Freaky little

827
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:14,023
freaky shakes, man. Freaky shakes!

828
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:14,976
- Is this edible?

829
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:16,521
- I don't know, did we make that part of it edible?

830
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:18,743
Lets see, here we go. 3, 2, 1...

831
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:20,234

832
00:21:20,234 --> 00:21:21,067
- Definitely plastic.

833
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,394
- Now its time for the deep fried twinkie.

834
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:26,420
- Oh I'm gonna go for the snickers. Can I get- please?

835
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,413
- What?

836
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:28,246
Fine, fine.

837
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,299
You get to try one of mine.

838
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:31,544
- [Both] 3, 2, 1...

839
00:21:31,544 --> 00:21:35,005
- Wow. Its very different than the candies I just had.

840
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:35,838
- Whoooo!

841
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:36,671
- What? Is that one really good?

842
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,910
You ate like all of it.

843
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,743
- I took a big bite man.

844
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:39,828
- I said like, take some of it.

845
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:41,476
- I know (laughs)

846
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:42,309
- I gotta try some of the top.

847
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,479
- Whoo! That's all I can say is whoo! You know what?

848
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,312
- What?

849
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:48,145
The time has come.

850
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:49,294
HAND MODE!

851
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:51,261
- [Devan] Ugh this lollipop I really wanna eat that.

852
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:53,323
- Whoo makes my hand very cold.

853
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:54,599
My hand is getting a brain freeze.

854
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,939
- Are you just going for it man? Holy cow.

855
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,570
- Um here we go.

856
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,987
Ah! Brain freeze!

857
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:01,824
- It's so cold!

858
00:22:01,824 --> 00:22:03,362
(both grunting)

859
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:04,838
- So the final thing here in this circus section

860
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:06,904

861
00:22:06,904 --> 00:22:07,737

862
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:08,570
Here we go, ready?

863
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,403
This takes concentration.

864
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:10,236
- Did you say little curly?

865
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:11,069
- Ah!

866
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:11,902

870
00:22:15,107 --> 00:22:17,736
- [Devan] All right I'm gonna set the barbell here

871
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,663
and now its time to break open one of these-

872
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:21,480
- All right you're gonna have to help me out

873
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,821
you're gonna have to tap my arm

874
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:23,740
- Okay.

875
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,704
- No on the count of 3. I need to be ready.

876
00:22:25,704 --> 00:22:26,821
- Is that a bruise there?

877
00:22:26,821 --> 00:22:27,654
- Yeah its gonna be a TikTok.

878
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:28,487
- 3, 2, 1

879
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:30,189
(shatters)

880
00:22:30,189 --> 00:22:31,165
- Ah!

881
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:32,653

You good?

884
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:36,364
- All right note to self, don't do that again.

885
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:37,359
Are we just gonna take a bite?

886
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,192
- Yeah let's do it.

887
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:39,525

888
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:43,881
- Mmm. Oh, that's the best one yet!

889
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:46,790
- Dude! Holy cow it's so soft!

890
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,059
- It's like a cake pop.

891
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,703
- Literally just imagine a cake pop, and then

892
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,220
multiply it by 10.

893
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,267
That is so good!

894
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:54,435
- Its delicious! Man great job!

895
00:22:54,435 --> 00:22:55,891
- Now its time to eat the candy coconut

896
00:22:55,891 --> 00:23:00,298
but first there's a butterfly that had the audacity

897
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:01,938
to land on my beautiful coconut.

898
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:03,271
- [Both] 3, 2, 1

899
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:08,842
- Mmm very delicate just like a butterfly.

900
00:23:08,842 --> 00:23:10,228
- Very light and airy.

901
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:11,411
All right enough of the butterfly

902
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:12,244
it's time for the main attraction

903
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:13,931
it is time for the coconut.

904
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:15,391
- What? The main attraction bro?

905
00:23:15,391 --> 00:23:17,468
- Everyone wants to know, what's it like

906
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:18,953
to have a candy coconut.

907
00:23:18,953 --> 00:23:20,628
You've gotta crack and smash this open.

908
00:23:20,628 --> 00:23:21,708
- You're right, you're right.

909
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,377
- I'll do it on this planter over here.

910
00:23:24,377 --> 00:23:25,991
- [Both] 3, 2, 1

911
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:26,824
(crack)

912
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:27,657
- [Both] Oh!

913
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,574
- No way! Look at that!

914
00:23:30,482 --> 00:23:31,815
Blown away!

915
00:23:31,815 --> 00:23:32,982
- Nicely done!

916
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,416
- [Both] 3, 2, 1

917
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,749
- Wow. - Mmm!

918
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:41,533
- Bro it's like a giant almond joy!

919
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:44,772
- All right so let's move on to the next candy.

920
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:46,077
All right it's time to try the candy pond

921
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:47,128
but the first thing I wanna try is

922
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:48,583
the actual soda pend.

923
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,503
- Soda pend.

924
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:50,744
- Pend, pond.

925
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:51,811
- Go for it.

926
00:23:51,811 --> 00:23:53,530
- Going for a scoop of the pond like this,

927
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,328
So here we go, ohp it's splashing around like this!

928
00:23:55,328 --> 00:23:56,613
- [Devan] 3, 2, 1

929
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:57,446
- Mmm!

930
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:00,307
- Is it good?

931
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:01,673
Delicious pond water!

932
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,128
- Mmm! - See isn't that good?

933
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:05,587
This froggy man is an absolute gem

934
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:07,431
a true masterpiece man.

935
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:08,515
- He really turned out good.

936
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,081
- We should probably eat him very quickly man.

937
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,337
- Lets do it. So I'm gonna try to take him off the lily pad

938
00:24:12,337 --> 00:24:13,170
if I can.

939
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,189
- He might be attached to it.

940
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:17,106
- [Devan] Oh! I broke the lily pad!

941
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,440
- [Both] No! Oh!

942
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,286
- Man, all right, well do you wanna take his head?

943
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:23,455
- I don't really feel comfortable with that.

944
00:24:23,455 --> 00:24:24,288
- Why?

945
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,121
- The head just fell off

946
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:26,344
I don't want that happening to me.

947
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:27,177
- Hold the lily pad.

948
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:28,278
- Okay what am I doing with this?

949
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:30,439
- What do you mean? Just hold it.

950
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,272
- Okay.

951
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:33,605
- Ready? Here we go, 3, 2, 1

952
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:36,231
- [Both] Oh!

953
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:37,457
- It tastes so good.

954
00:24:37,457 --> 00:24:38,987
It's so fruity and fresh.

955
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:41,174
- The way you ate that, I'm gonna let you enjoy this one.

956
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:43,096
- I don't know if there's a clean way of me getting any.

957
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:44,838
- Dude! This is so good!

958
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:46,405
- Do you wanna take a bite of your cupcake bro?

959
00:24:46,405 --> 00:24:48,505
Your homemade ice cream is lowkey delicious.

960
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:50,444
- Okay hold up, hold up. Gotta put this to the side here.

961
00:24:50,444 --> 00:24:51,816
- I got some of the lily pad as well.

962
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:52,888
- I wanna try that after. Here we go

963
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:55,289
- Losing a bit of it, all right,

964
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,372
- [Both] 3, 2, 1... whoa!

965
00:25:00,797 --> 00:25:01,912
- That tastes so good!

966
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:03,710
- You gotta try some of the lily pad.

967
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,710
- [Both] No!

968
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:08,431
- Are you kidding me?

969
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:10,562
- I guess the lily pad was a once in a lifetime experience.

970
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:12,372
- It is now the moment we've all been waiting for,

971
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:13,676
time to eat.

972
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:17,940
These wonderfully, massively oversized oreos.

973
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,971
So here we go just gonna slice down this oreo just like this

974
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:21,138
- [Both] Whoa!

975
00:25:24,504 --> 00:25:26,045
- [Collins] Check this out!

976
00:25:26,045 --> 00:25:27,937
We'll just go back over here and do the review.

977
00:25:27,937 --> 00:25:30,020
- [Both] 3, 2, 1... whoa!

978
00:25:32,078 --> 00:25:34,161
- Look at that! Holy cow!

979
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,953
- Our dad has been eyeballing this all day.

980
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,698
- Time to take a bite of this insane delicious oreo. Ready?

981
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:44,448
- Yeah here we go. 3, 2, 1... oh!

982
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:50,921
- That oreo is absolutely incredible.

983
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:52,689
And all of this is absolutely insane.

984
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:55,194
We went all out. This is one of the greatest things

985
00:25:55,194 --> 00:25:56,027
we've ever done.

986
00:25:56,027 --> 00:25:57,500
So comment down below in 5 seconds, here we go,

987
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,762
5, 4,-

988
00:25:58,762 --> 00:25:59,762
- [Both] Oh!

989
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:02,197
- That's our cookie!

990
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:03,190
Love you guys! Bye!

991
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,023
- Bye!
