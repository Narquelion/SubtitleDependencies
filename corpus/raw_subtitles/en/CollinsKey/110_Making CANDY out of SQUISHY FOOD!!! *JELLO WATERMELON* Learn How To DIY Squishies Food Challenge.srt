1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,530
- Squishy!

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,090
- Oh my gosh! - Ooh, what!

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,960
- When you challenge us to mold squishy foods into candies

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,130
and right now we're kicking it off

5
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,586
with the bags of mystery.

6
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:09,618
Oh my gosh!

7
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:11,921
Devin choose your mystery squishy.

8
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:13,058
- I'll take this one.

9
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:13,891
- Okay, what did you get?

10
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:15,870
- Whoa, I got popcorn.

11
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,770
- You can't use paper, that's not edible Devin.

12
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,160
- Yeah, this is edible paper, bro.

13
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,993
- Whoa!

14
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:20,826
Oh my gosh!

15
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:22,036
- That's really not.

16
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:23,394
- Ahh.

17
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:24,750
- It's actually kinda sharp.

18
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,720
- It hurts my lip!

19
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,710
- That's a lot of Airheads.

20
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,880
Lick it and stick it!

21
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,570
- I'm gonna make my entire popcorn container

22
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,600
out of edible paper.

23
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,290
- Dude, this is gonna be so tough.

24
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,123
How do you do this?

25
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:36,029
- Oops!

26
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:37,096
- Oh, no!

27
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:38,075
What are you doing?

28
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:39,560
(laughing)

29
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,380
You missed the marks so much.

30
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,040
- (coughs) Dude, they're so dry.

31
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,904
The reason I'm doing this is because

32
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:45,800
these are my binding ingredients.

33
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,677
Oh man.

34
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:48,533
Ooh that's not good, bro.

35
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:49,366
Stop!

36
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,364
- Get off my finger, you're not welcome here!

37
00:00:50,364 --> 00:00:51,197
Shmellos!

38
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:52,330
- These things are like hard to deal with, bro.

39
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,390
I'm like having to smoosh these together

40
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,600
but they're some coating on them so they don't want to.

41
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,874
So they're just sliding around like that.

42
00:00:57,874 --> 00:01:00,000
- You, you almost hit my shmello line.

43
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,833
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

44
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:01,666
Oh yeah!

45
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,910
So now the moment of truth.

46
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,950
I gotta kind of roll this over and then attach the line.

47
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,783
Bam!

48
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:08,883
Hand inside, shmoosh!

49
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:09,716
The shmellos!

50
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:10,549
Squeesh!

51
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:11,615
Oh yeah, boy!

52
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,087
Haha!

53
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:15,360
Dude, I'm so excited, it really worked.

54
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,419
- Did it actually work?

55
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:17,252
- Yes!

56
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:18,085
- Wow.

57
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:19,273
- Alright, so, I'm gonna use a Kit Kats as the bottom

58
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:20,680
of my shmello thing.

59
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,850
I'm gonna place it like that.

60
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,440
Ooh, ooh.

61
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,480
- There is no popcorn container

62
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,220
that is that long and that tall.

63
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,053
- That's why I have scissors!

64
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:29,220
- Oh man, oh man, oh,

65
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,239
this better not ruin my entire operation.

66
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,072
(screeches)

67
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:33,212
Oh, yes, yes!

68
00:01:33,212 --> 00:01:34,829
Lots of yeses.

69
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:35,662
(claps)

70
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,730
- I have the brilliant idea of wrapping this.

71
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,563
Nope.

72
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:39,950
- Here is where I turn into Devin the artist

73
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,360
because I have to now color in my paper

74
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,250
to make it look red.

75
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,083
- Nice!

76
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:44,980
- Hahaha!

77
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,813
Sweet!

78
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:47,313
The lines are getting progressively worse and worse

79
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:48,411
as I keep going.

80
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,690
- Ahh!

81
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,940
- My thumbs have never gotten a better work out in my life.

82
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,990
- Bam, there we go.

83
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,860
It's a little raggedy but you get the point.

84
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,910
I'm on to the final step.

85
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,160
So it starts off with marshmallows

86
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,613
to kind of like seal it in place.

87
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:01,350
- Ooh! bro, the cup's almost done.

88
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,600
- Yeah, it's gonna taste so good.

89
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,970
And finally, the yellow Skittles to add

90
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,300
as the buttered popcorn.

91
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,180
Yo, my marshmallows, they may not work.

92
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,013
They may not stay.

93
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,520
- It's busting at the seams!

94
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,991
- Okay, quickly, quickly, quickly.

95
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:12,824
Ahh!

96
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:13,657
- No!

97
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:15,284
(claps)

98
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:16,250
Yes!

99
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,083
I think I'm gonna win this.

100
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,240
- I thought I had it too it was so close

101
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,243
and then it just.

102
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:21,250
(dog howls)

103
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,040
- That did not hold at all.

104
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,470
- Well, it, uh, ah.

105
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,303
- Alright it's time.

106
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:26,740
Bro, what are you doing?

107
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,573
- Well, I'm just helping.

108
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:29,010
I love marshmallows, I just want to help!

109
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,923
- This is my moment.

110
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:31,540
- I think you're gonna want to put some of these in there.

111
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,373
- Really, dude?

112
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:33,290
I know how to do this.

113
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,750
- Now we get to eat these and see how they taste.

114
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,280
Man, this has got paper and marker on it.

115
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,200
So we'll see and you guys comment down below

116
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,610
who won this round.

117
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,443
But, here we go.

118
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:42,276
Are you ready, Devin?

119
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:43,670
- [Both] Three, two, one.

120
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:47,345
(candy clattering)

121
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:48,178
- Aww.

122
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:50,567
- Ahh (inaudible).

123
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,019
- Whoa!

124
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,481
(claps)

125
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:54,743
It's so good.

126
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:56,020
- This is good, too.

127
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,260
- It's stuck to my teeth though.

128
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,730
- Alright guys, we're on to the next round.

129
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,616
Woo woo.

130
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:01,693
This is so good man.

131
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:02,526
- Wha!

132
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:04,430
- Alright Collins, your turn to pick the squishy.

133
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,560
- A very special technique.

134
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,700
It's called the claw.

135
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,110
One, two.

136
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:09,910
This one.

137
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,743
And this is how you open it.

138
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:11,787
Ooh!

139
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:12,620
My gosh!

140
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,830
Well, it's back!

141
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,663
Ice cream!

142
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:15,496
Dude! - Bro!

143
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,541
- Squishy ice cream!

144
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,426
Before this guys we actually got some giant

145
00:03:18,426 --> 00:03:21,210
Rice Krispy Treats for the cone.

146
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,043
Right now,

147
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,351
here we, ow!

148
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,300
Watch, we go one, two, three.

149
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,610
(screaming)

150
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,710
- My ear hurts really bad.

151
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,605
- Sorry, bro.

152
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:28,438
Yeet!

153
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:29,530
And now, I need to slice and dice

154
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,050
because I gotta create myself.

155
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,300
Woo!

156
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,908
If you didn't know, I get startled and scared really easy

157
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:37,064
and that's why I do not watch scary movies, ever.

158
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:38,480
- Oh cool, we got the pink here

159
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,886
and I gotta mold it into a circle.

160
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,840
Alright, first scoop done.

161
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,060
Looking pretty good, right?

162
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,170
- Oh my gosh, this is very difficult.

163
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,050
I think I need more Krispy Treat.

164
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,160
Instead of a cone I have created a ball.

165
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,340
- Okay.

166
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,230
Ah, it's so fluffy.

167
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,063
Mmm.

168
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:52,896
- Is it good?

169
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:53,729
- Oh, bro.

170
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:54,830
- Dude, this stuff feels nice.

171
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,070
So I'm gonna try, to like, put this here.

172
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,590
I think I've ruined the fluffiness of it.

173
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,490
I didn't know you could ruin the fluffiness.

174
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,660
I ruined the fluffiness of it.

175
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,079
Dude, pop this on top like that.

176
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,690
- You know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna lick my finger

177
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,160
and then, hopefully, it'll stick it to the other one

178
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,706
'cause right now it just, it falls off.

179
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,305
- My finger tastes really good.

180
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:09,310
- Alright, it's done.

181
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,620
Wait, what's the purpose of that?

182
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,453
Sprinkles!

183
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:14,629
It's like a cupcake, not ice cream, bro.

184
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,410
- Mine has a little bit of hair on it, dude.

185
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,243
Look at that.

186
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:18,371
It's like a little, woo!

187
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,340
- So we're gonna be eating these at the end of the video.

188
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,690
So comment down below who won this round.

189
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,702
The next one we're gonna make is gonna be crazy Devin.

190
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:25,810
- Yeah?

191
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,760
- Select a bag!

192
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,020
- Alright it is a.

193
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,853
whoa!

194
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,180
It's a watermelon, bro!

195
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,630
- Step one we gotta heat up this pot with some water.

196
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,620
As the water's boiling,

197
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,804
right now it's time to chop this watermelon in half.

198
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:36,637
(knife slices)

199
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:37,470
- Ooh!

200
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,886
Snap, that actually worked!

201
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:39,719
We're gonna do a little race.

202
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:40,699
Whoever carves it out first wins.

203
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,840
(high speed audio)

204
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,400
(cheerful piano music)

205
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,233
I think we're good.

206
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,090
That's it, that's done.

207
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,700
What I don't understand is how I cleared out

208
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,860
so much more watermelon than you did.

209
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,640
The next step is where this whole thing starts to get cool

210
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,743
but first, we gotta finish the clear out, I guess.

211
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:56,130
(slurps)

212
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,220
Oh my gosh.

213
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,290
That is so good.

214
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,600
Okay, time to add in the water right now, Devin.

215
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,960
- I got my makeshift mitts.

216
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,840
I gotta be very careful.

217
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,393
Make sure no steam.

218
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:06,630
- Oh my gosh, you splashed it, Devin!

219
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,150
- I'm doing the best I can, bro.

220
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,983
Is that enough?

221
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:09,950
- You want to do all of it, Devin.

222
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,980
And right over here, guys,

223
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,370
we've got the gelatin.

224
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,810
So, this is what's gonna turn it into the gel.

225
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,740
So, I'm only gonna add a little bit at a time.

226
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,910
Probably way too much.

227
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,743
If I've learned one thing,

228
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:19,190
it's that I have terrible Jell-O control.

229
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,240
- Jell-O control.

230
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,730
- Oh, gosh, this smells terrible.

231
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,950
Oh, man!

232
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,110
- And the thing is, we don't want any watermelon.

233
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,943
- No.

234
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,500
- So Devin, you're actually gonna pulverize that

235
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,520
and we're gonna add that to the Jell-O

236
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,353
coming up here in a little bit.

237
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:30,800
So first, oh!

238
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,633
Way too much!

239
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,680
Way way way too much!

240
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,916
And now we continue to mix.

241
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:37,749
- [Spongebob Narrator]

242
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:38,582
- I like my job.

243
00:05:38,582 --> 00:05:39,415
This is fun.

244
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:40,720
- Aright, here we go, the final amount.

245
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,553
Boom!

246
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:42,629
- Whoa!

247
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:43,500
Isn't that way too much at one time?

248
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,930
- Devin, I am a master mixer!

249
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,340
- So, weren't you the one to just say

250
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,938
that you have terrible Jell-O control?

251
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:49,180
(swoosh)

252
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,013
- Believe what you want

253
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:52,690
Alright, now it is time to add the watermelon flavor.

254
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,977
- Now we gotta break down all the pieces of watermelon.

255
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:56,010
(magic chimes) Now we got it all

256
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,040
melted down we gotta add back here.

257
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,270
- It's all you, bro, all you.

258
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,103
- Three.

259
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:00,936
- Better not spill it on me.

260
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:02,728
Two, I know, one!

261
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,532
- Oh! no, no, no, no!

262
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,080
(slow motion yelling)

263
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,913
Hot!

264
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:07,746
- I'm so sorry bro!

265
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:08,579
(beep)

266
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:10,420
Well, let's just say that did not go according to plan.

267
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,340
- No. - But now,

268
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,260
we got the watermelon in here.

269
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,093
Go for it.

270
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:13,926
Go for it. - I'm doing it.

271
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:14,759
I'm going for it, Collins.

272
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,592
- Yo, that thing is really cool.

273
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,620
Next step we gotta pop this thing in the fridge.

274
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,550
We have to wait a little bit.

275
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,138
Right now, let's make it cold.

276
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:21,327
(magic chimes) - Yo!

277
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:22,740
That is so good.

278
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,790
- It's watermelon flavored Jell-O, too.

279
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,850
- Alright, here's how the slice works.

280
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,277
You ready? (claps)

281
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,230
(knife slices) Yo, that actually worked!

282
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,280
Holy cow this looks amazing!

283
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,510
- I can't wait to eat this.

284
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,820
- Dude, this is gonna be the most delicious thing

285
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,890
of all time!

286
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,723
Okay, you ready?

287
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:39,180
- [Both] Three, two, one.

288
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,200
Wait, first, five second subscribe challenge!

289
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,220
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

290
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,041
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

291
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,049
Alright, ya ready?

292
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:48,240
Here we go.

293
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,240
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done!

294
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,470
- If you can do that, comment down below,

295
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,890
keeper squad, right now.

296
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,920
Let's see how this thing tastes.

297
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,260
Ya ready? - Yeah, I'm ready.

298
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,093
- Cheers! - Alright.

299
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:00,950
(gushing)

300
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,783
- Whoa!

301
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:03,987
Dude, next one.

302
00:07:03,987 --> 00:07:05,050
Let's go. - Alright Collins,

303
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,320
your turn to pick your squishy.

304
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,540
- I'm going to do the claw again.

305
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,373
- Aw no.

306
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:10,661
- Three, two, one.

307
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:12,100
Ah, the claw is broken.

308
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,126
- Yeah, it must be.

309
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:13,959
Yeah!

310
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,820
- Okay, let's see what we're gonna do.

311
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,223
- Oh, it's a cactus.

312
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,163
- I was like, what is that?

313
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,461
- It is adorable.

314
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:19,350
- It's so squishy.

315
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,120
Well guys, this is gonna be a candy, spineless porcupine.

316
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,953
(buzzer)

317
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:24,786
Cactus.

318
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,010
- I'm sorry, wrong spikey thing.

319
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,096
- Let's go, we're gonna use these.

320
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:29,297
- You don't need to do it more than once.

321
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:30,130
(whoosh)

322
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:30,963
(laughter)

323
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:31,900
Alright guys, so here we go.

324
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,340
Alright. - Whoa, what are you doing?

325
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,550
- I can't hear you man,

326
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,507
I'm blocking out the haters.

327
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:38,750
Ow! There's a really weird echo in your ears man.

328
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,170
It like magnifies the sound.

329
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,385
Yo, I remember these!

330
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:42,810
Dude, they are super sour.

331
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,981
I do not like these.

332
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:44,814
Listen to this. (clacking)

333
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,150
- You're gonna break the table, bro.

334
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,983
- Shatter a tooth.

335
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:47,960
Alright so this, the first thing.

336
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,080
Let's see if it'll even fit.

337
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,913
(clack)

338
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:51,080
- Well, not when you do it like that!

339
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,960
- It's just. (clacking)

340
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,014
- Bro. (clack)

341
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:56,060
Alright, this is how you do it, Collins.

342
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,259
Gently, and then press.

343
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,900
- Ooh no! (glass shattering)

344
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,733
- I think it broke!

345
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,210
- It literally burst in half.

346
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,110
- So basically you crumble these up

347
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,540
and put them into the cup.

348
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,360
- Or you're cool and have a legit actual little rocks

349
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,193
you can pour into this.

350
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:10,420
Alright, now we gotta Laffy Taffy.

351
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,840
You gotta make a pink little bow

352
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,140
that looks just like a spiral.

353
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,080
- Or just a mush.

354
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,913
- Ta-da!

355
00:08:14,913 --> 00:08:15,746
It looks like a hat.

356
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,579
What did you do?

357
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,170
- It's like a cowboy hat, perfect.

358
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,350
It's got the googly eyes.

359
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,160
- Alright, I have completed the pebble stage of my journey

360
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,660
and I'm gonna take these macaroons

361
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,080
and kinda stick 'em together.

362
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,060
Aww, I feel like it's gonna fall apart any second.

363
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,270
Alright, got two eyes on there.

364
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,103
It's looking good.

365
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:32,282
How is it looking?

366
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:33,115
I realize. (gasping)

367
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:35,168
- And you mess it up like that - No, my masterpiece.

368
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,960
- Well, I think that I totally won this round.

369
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,793
Like completely.

370
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:39,240
- Well, yeah, 'cause yours was the only option,

371
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,560
not because it's far superior.

372
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,506
- I don't actually want to eat my cactus because

373
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:45,100
it is sour and I do not like sour things.

374
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,840
So you get to comment down below who won this round and

375
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,907
we're on to the next one.

376
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:49,950
(swoosh) So Devin choose

377
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,430
your next mystery squishy cause

378
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,700
we're coming down to the finale.

379
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,695
- This one, it is this!

380
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:54,528
(bell ring) - Dude, Narwhals

381
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:55,993
they're, wait, they're what?

382
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,210
- Narwhals.

383
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,043
They're so cute.

384
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:58,960
- You don't know what a narwhal is?

385
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,793
- I have no idea what a narwhal is.

386
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:01,620
- Dude and they're so squishy, oh my gosh.

387
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,541
So right now, Devin, the competition heats up.

388
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,374
(squeak)

389
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:05,909
And time to make an edible narwhal out of candy.

390
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:06,742
So here we go,

391
00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:08,861
I'm gonna use these blue marshmallows to construct.

392
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:10,250
- Oh, there's cake here.

393
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,667
Oh no, this is gonna be so messy.

394
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:12,500
Oh!

395
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,902
- Why are you using?

396
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:14,900
- Oh, this does not feel good.

397
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:16,706
That is a terrible idea.

398
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:17,539
This is bringing back memories from the cupcake.

399
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:18,372
Challenge. - I know.

400
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:19,205
Yo, we should do another one of those.

401
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:20,290
- This doesn't work at all.

402
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,540
Bro, like, what is going on.

403
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,066
- Yo, my narwhals look more like a car right now

404
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:26,230
than an actual narwhal, but you'll see

405
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,720
how it turns out, this is really good.

406
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,560
- Alright, this may not look like anything

407
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,730
at the moment but trust me.

408
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,880
- That looks like literally nothing to me right now, Devin.

409
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,160
It looks like failure. (claps)

410
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,890
- Alright, time to grab this cotton candy

411
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,860
and I gotta smoosh it.

412
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,160
- That's actually really smart.

413
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,010
- Thank you. - But I still think

414
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm gonna win this round due

415
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,280
to my pure engineering ingenuity.

416
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,470
Boom, another narwhal eye, and then you just

417
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,890
gotta add, ya know, a big happy grin.

418
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,510
Uh oh, it like lost its grin.

419
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,343
It's like yeah, grunt.

420
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:52,730
One part of the mouth just dropped.

421
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,640
Oh, oh, oh, and I almost forgot

422
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,790
the most important part of any narwhal, its horn!

423
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,750
Wait, look at that.

424
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,650
Don't tell me it's disproportionate.

425
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,080
There is my narwhal's horn.

426
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,913
Ya know what?

427
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:03,746
It needs a final touch to it.

428
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:05,980
Probably not gonna stay up.

429
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,060
Worked for a second.

430
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,483
- Alright, well, there is it's two eyes.

431
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,310
- It looks like Jabba the Hutt.

432
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,585
- It kinda does (laughs), ooh!

433
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:13,650
- I want to improve your narwhal.

434
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,790
- You better not mess this up.

435
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,623
Are those eyebrows?

436
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:16,456
- You have a banana brow.

437
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:17,538
(laughing) (clapping)

438
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:19,630
- That's hilarious, nicely done, bro, nicely done.

439
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,279
- I shouldn't, I'm not gonna high five that hand. (laughs)

440
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,496
It's got no mouth, it's like, I'm a narwhal!

441
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:27,235
- I was just noticing how small the mouth is on here, so.

442
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,068
- Mine's the opposite.

443
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:29,410
Mine's like mwah!

444
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,243
- And done. (ping)

445
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:31,630
- I gotta be careful when I eat this one

446
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,930
because there's a lot of toothpicks in it

447
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,180
so you get to comment on it down below, right now,

448
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,330
which narwhal won, and we are on to the finale

449
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,870
and it all comes down to this.

450
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,703
- Alright Collins.

451
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:42,750
- Here's one.

452
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,104
Okay, great, let's see what we got.

453
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:44,970
Okay.

454
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,803
A bread!

455
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:47,180
(buzzer) A sandwich.

456
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,630
So this seems like the sweetest sandwich of all times

457
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,484
but first I gotta squish it and then, yeet!

458
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,850
Ow! (goofy howl) (thud)

459
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:56,150
Ow, there we go.

460
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,220
Snapped it in half.

461
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,450
It's like a butterfly, like, woo.

462
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,740
So I guess I don't know how we're gonna do this.

463
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,370
I'm gonna make a design, what are you doing?

464
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,320
- I'm making it square!

465
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,450
- Alright we'll get the jelly on there.

466
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,340
Uh oh, this thing is gonna leak off of the side.

467
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,930
- Oh, you're not in time now.

468
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,440
Our table is gonna be stained.

469
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,580
- Peanut butter or should we say caramel on the other side.

470
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,850
Yeah, it doesn't look nearly as thick as peanut butter does.

471
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,599
- So, I guess, ya know, we just get to put blueberries.

472
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,432
- What?

473
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:17,340
- On there, these are blueberries.

474
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,173
- Ah, okay.

475
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:21,000
- Nothing like having the earthy taste of some gravel.

476
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,930
- Who wants that?

477
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,400
- Put some narwhals horns.

478
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,120
This sandwich would be amazing to eat,

479
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,829
cause it's literally just straight candy.

480
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:29,670
- It looks like it would be really difficult and crunchy

481
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,200
and you got all these pokey things.

482
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,880
- Dude, stop hating on me.

483
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,140
Woo, Oh yeah man!

484
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,660
Make a banana sandwich.

485
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,208
- Ooh! - This smells like a banana.

486
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,970
A healthy banana on your sandwich.

487
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,727
Yo, we got tiny little bananas.

488
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:43,800
- Bro - I'm gonna border them, boom,

489
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,633
around the edges.

490
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:47,460
- Ooh, gonna use some of these, too, bro.

491
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,853
Oh yeah!

492
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:49,686
- Nice!

493
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:50,588
- It's like a spaghetti sandwich.

494
00:11:50,588 --> 00:11:51,421
- Spaghet!

495
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,220
- Alright, next up, I'm gonna add some of these bananas.

496
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,510
Gotta shake them up.

497
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,343
- You don't shake the bananas.

498
00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:56,425
- Yes, you do!

499
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,010
- Ooh, that actually looks really satisfying.

500
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,843
- That looks really cool.

501
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,210
And next I'm gonna add some of these graham crackers.

502
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,539
It is time to put the top on my sandwich.

503
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:05,570
- But before we do that,

504
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,860
we gotta eat all the other squishy candies that we made

505
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,630
and then we're gonna be eating this sandwich

506
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,440
so comment down below on who won,

507
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,050
but right now let's eat some candy.

508
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,620
So this one right here we got our ice cream.

509
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,060
In my case it's like a bowl with a birds nest

510
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,893
with some eggs.

511
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:20,060
- Oh I see it, I see it.

512
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,252
- Yup, so here we go. (laughing)

513
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:25,860
- Nice, I'm not even gonna help you, just let you flounder.

514
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,978
How's the combo?

515
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:27,811
- Weird.

516
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:28,692
I think if you don't like weird flavor

517
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:29,617
'cause they don't taste that good.

518
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:32,350
It's like the Bean Boozled challenge like man whoo!

519
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,183
- I'm going for mine.

520
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:35,770
- Oh yeah. - Oh, tastes fabulous.

521
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:40,330
- Holy cow!

522
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,163
- Wooh, this combo.

523
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:41,996
- Is it good?

524
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:42,829
- Mmm.

525
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,520
Bro, this is good.

526
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,353
(laughs)

527
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:46,220
- So how we're gonna do this, Devin,

528
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,798
I do not wanna have to eat the sour ones.

529
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:49,380
Gonna do rock paper scissors. - I don't either.

530
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,190
Best out of three has to eat this.

531
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,390
- [Both] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

532
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,223
- Nah! (buzzer)

533
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:55,799
- [Both] Rock paper scissors, shoot.

534
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,529
(buzzer) - Yeah!

535
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:58,362
(yelling)

536
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:01,130
- Three, two, one.

537
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,600
- You can't just eat the Laffy Taffy, no no no!

538
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,433
- Oh, so bad!

539
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:06,266
(tone)

540
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:07,320
Ugh!

541
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,866
- Dude, your tongue is getting, like, green.

542
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:09,699
- Ugh!

543
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,080
- Oh my gosh.

544
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,160
- Yeah, it's pretty sour.

545
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,894
- And can't forget, of course, the rocks.

546
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,108
- I'll take it.

547
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:18,276
- And now it's time to eat the narwhal.

548
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:19,422
So I'm gonna eat mine first,

549
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:22,455
hopefully I don't get a toothpick to the top of the mouth.

550
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:24,907
(laughs) Got a little bit.

551
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:27,207
Tastes exactly the way I thought it would taste.

552
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,040
(laughs)

553
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,410
And I guess now I'm just gonna have to pick up

554
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,240
my whole narwhal, except for the bottom half of it.

555
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,566
I do not know. - Wait.

556
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:34,580
That was, like, his mouth.

557
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,020
He was like nom, nom, nom.

558
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,667
- Yo, yo, we should feed my narwhal.

559
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,586
(shouting)

560
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,436
- He's like a cookie monster narwhal!

561
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,056
I'm so nervous for you.

562
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,318
I don't, what are you doing?

563
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:46,627
Dude, you're supposed to eat this?

564
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:47,576
(chuckles)

565
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,704
Dude, careful. - Thank you.

566
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,810
- So I don't even know how I'm gonna pick this up, dude.

567
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,790
I'm gonna scoop it.

568
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,928
Oh, no, no, no, no, the face

569
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:55,710
is just splitting in, (shouting) oh no!

570
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,543
I'm so sorry.

571
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:58,518
Oh, alright, here we go!

572
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:00,913
- Yo! - Oh, (moans) oh.

573
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:02,850
- You even got cotton candy on there!

574
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,630
Alright, so time to eat these sandwiches!

575
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,422
Let's see if I can get this up.

576
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:07,255
- It's like a taco, bro.

577
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:08,480
- Oh, snap, how do I get this up?

578
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,320
- I got it! - Dude!

579
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,370
- Yo. - Bra.

580
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,940
- Oh no!

581
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,100
- Alright, you ready for the bite?

582
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,160
- I'm so ready, dude!

583
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,993
- This is crazy!

584
00:14:14,993 --> 00:14:16,024
- Look at this!

585
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,770
- Three, two, one, go!

586
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,379
All I got was Rice Krispy.

587
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:24,581
What? - Oh, it's so good!

588
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:25,511
- Click on subscribe right now!

589
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:28,594
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one.

590
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,371
