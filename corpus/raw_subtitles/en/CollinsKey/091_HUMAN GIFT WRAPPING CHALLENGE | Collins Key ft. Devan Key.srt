1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,763
- And everything else that comes with the holidays.

2
00:00:01,763 --> 00:00:02,596
Oh my god!

3
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:03,429
Santa almost died.

4
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:04,574
That was close.

5
00:00:04,574 --> 00:00:06,444
(upbeat Jingle Bells tune)

6
00:00:06,444 --> 00:00:08,212
What's up guys? It's Collins Key

7
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:10,401
and welcome to my new holiday video.

8
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:12,289
One of my favorite things about the holidays

9
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:14,348
is being able to spend so much time with my family.

10
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,625
So for today's video appearing right here

11
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,537
in front of our awesome Christmas tree

12
00:00:18,537 --> 00:00:21,049
please welcome Devin Key.

13
00:00:21,049 --> 00:00:22,614
- (ninja shouting)

14
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,447
- Hey, whoa, whoa. Ow!

15
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:24,503
Okay, you're done. Get out of my video.

16
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:25,705
Yeah, that was fun, okay.

17
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:26,831
- (ninja shouting)

18
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:27,878
- Okay, I'm taking this away from you.

19
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:28,740
Since this is the holidays,

20
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,026
I made my very own holiday challenge,

21
00:00:30,026 --> 00:00:32,358
it's called the Human

22
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:33,591
Gift Wrapping

23
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:34,464
Challenge.

24
00:00:34,464 --> 00:00:35,297
It's really fun,

25
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:37,240
but basically we're each gonna have a minute and half

26
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,488
to wrap each other like a gift.

27
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:41,370
This is so hard to do an intro on this.

28
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,288
(shattering sound)

29
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:44,121
- Turn it up,

30
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:44,954
oh,

31
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:45,787
yeey.

32
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:46,701
- (whipping sound)

33
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:48,166
- Let's get started with the challenge.

34
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:48,999
- (ninja shouting)

35
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:49,834
- For the challenge,

36
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,459
since Devin is the guest on my channel Key,

37
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:52,993
he'll have the honor and he can go first.

38
00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:53,938
Three, two, go.

39
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:56,753
(speaking in fast forward)

40
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:59,670
(fast banjo music)

41
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:14,050
- No, no, no.

42
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,883
- What?

43
00:01:14,883 --> 00:01:15,716
- I know what you're gonna...

44
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:16,549
Ah man!

45
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:17,669
(fast forward speaking)

46
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:19,120
Oh no!

47
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,453
(fast forward speaking)

48
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:27,312
- I think it's been a minute.

49
00:01:27,312 --> 00:01:29,112
Since he's wrapped up and completely...

50
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:30,696
- Yeah, this is great, this is great.

51
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,440
Great fun, great fun, great fun.

52
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,656
- Completely defenseless,

53
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:36,856
one bow there, one there, one there, and one there.

54
00:01:36,856 --> 00:01:39,274
- Help, Santa, immediately.

55
00:01:39,274 --> 00:01:40,592
- (Ninja sounds)

56
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:42,880
- (Screams)

57
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,797
(fast banjo music)

58
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,761
The bonus challenge within the challenge,

59
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,858
how fast can I escape from the wrapping?

60
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:52,882
Yeah!

61
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:55,299
- While Devin is hitting him.

62
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:58,790
- Oh, dude, why?

63
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:02,049
Ow! This is actually not fun.

64
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:02,882
Ow.

65
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:03,715
Okay.

66
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:04,981
- (Ninja screams)

67
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:08,564
(wrapping paper crinkling)

68
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:15,678
- Yay.

69
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,678
- That was round one

70
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,502
of the Human Wrapping Challenge.

71
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:21,350
Now it's my turn to make him look like a human present.

72
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,815
Three, two, one, go.

73
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:24,055
- Can I resist at all?

74
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:25,926
- No, dude, you're supposed to help me.

75
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:27,771
(fast forward speaking)

76
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:30,688
(fast banjo music)

77
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,678
(tape pulling sound)

78
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:41,845
(fast forward speaking and yelling)

79
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:57,166
- Notice the nice corset right here

80
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,966
to really accentuate his tuckus.

81
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:02,526
His tuckus is nicely accentuated.

82
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:05,443
(fast banjo music)

83
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:08,878
- Woo! Yeah!

84
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:09,711
- No!

85
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,432
- Yo.

86
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:12,558
What the?

87
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:13,391
Ow.

88
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,224
Holy cow,

89
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:15,093
you're dangerous.

90
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,821
My corset of power is working.

91
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,101
My corset of power is working.

92
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:19,934
- Ah!

93
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,358
- And (claps), ta-da!

94
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:24,671
All right, and that is the Human Gift Wrapping Challenge.

95
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,148
And if guys'd love to find Devin and I

96
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:27,703

109
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,612
(wrapping paper crinkling)

110
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:47,960
(upbeat Jingle Bells)

111
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,682
That part was so stupid. (laughs)

112
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:54,265
(wrapping paper crinkling)
