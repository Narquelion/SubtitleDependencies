00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:01,690
- What's up guys it's Collins Key

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,162
and welcome to the third day vlog, now for today's video

3
00:00:04,162 --> 00:00:07,701
I'm doing something a magician should never do.

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:09,399
And I've never done this before on my channel

5
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:11,247
but I know we've got Easter coming up this weekend

6
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:13,682
so in honor of the holiday weekend,

7
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:16,998
I'm actually gonna reveal to you guys a magic trick.

8
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:18,427
What, oh my gosh.

9
00:00:18,427 --> 00:00:20,596
For this piece of magic you're gonna be using the high tech

10
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:24,950
piece of equipment that they call the silk handkerchief.

11
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,946
Yeah, you take the handkerchief and what you're gonna do

12
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:30,732
is put the handkerchief into your hand.

13
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:32,734
And now at this point you're probably thinking to yourself

14
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:35,247
wait a second what does this magic trick have to do

15
00:00:35,247 --> 00:00:36,080
with Easter.

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,913
Well, check it out.

17
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:37,746
(snaps) Bam.

18
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,088
Just like that.

19
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:39,921
Egg, what?

20
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:42,871
I know you guys are probably freaking out right now.

21
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,392
No camera tricks.

22
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,250
Do you guys wanna know how this works?

23
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,119
Check this out.

24
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,036
Hollow egg.

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,656
Hit the thumbs up button if you guy's are kind of

26
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:52,602
blown away by this method.

27
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,762
So literally you stuff the handkerchief

28
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:56,532
inside the hollow.

29
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:58,129
Magicians, we like too much time on our hands,

30
00:00:58,129 --> 00:00:59,395
we just make the hollow eggs all the time.

31
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:01,354
And for this I'm actually gonna teach you guys

32
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:04,189
step by step exactly what you need to do to perform this

33
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,767
for your friends, your family, and fool them on Easter.

34
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,386
So come on over here Devon.

35
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:09,315
- What's up guys? - Devon.

36
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:10,148
This guy's not a magician.

37
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:10,981
- Yeah, no, I'm not. - Just a regular.

38
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:11,814
- At all. - He's a Muggle.

39
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:12,905
Devon's a Muggle. - Yeah, I'm a Muggle.

40
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,066
- So take this, take the hollow egg.

41
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:14,899
- Okay.

42
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:17,706
- Take the handkerchief, I have one more hollow egg

43
00:01:17,706 --> 00:01:19,825
right over here and I actually have one more handkerchief.

44
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:22,048
And I'm gonna take you guys step by step how to do this.

45
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,437
So first step take the egg and you're gonna palm it.

46
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:25,845
So put it in your hand just like this.

47
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:28,753
There we go, make sure everyone can see that, got it?

48
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:30,395
Palm it in your hand, take the handkerchief

49
00:01:30,395 --> 00:01:32,294
give it a nice little flourish.

50
00:01:32,294 --> 00:01:33,534
(laughs)

51
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:35,128
Just have a magician war with the handkerchieves.

52
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,871
And now you're gonna take this handkerchief

53
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:40,232
and you're gonna put it into the egg.

54
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:41,549
Now this is the great part of the magic

55
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,092
because everyone thinks you're just puttin'

56
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:44,526
this handkerchief into your hand,

57
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:47,504
when in reality it's going directly into that hollow egg

58
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:49,987
and you're about to blow their mind in just a second.

59
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:51,730
So make sure it's all the way in the egg,

60
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,139
nothing sticking out, make sure it's all the way in the egg.

61
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,095
Little magical gesture.

62
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:56,928
(snaps) Snap.

63
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:57,761
(snaps)

64
00:01:57,761 --> 00:01:59,459
Then show the egg.

65
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:00,292
What?

66
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,168
- No way. Now at this point

67
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,485
people, they're gonna freak out,

68
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:04,047
they're gonna be like what just happened

69
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:04,880
to the handkerchief?

70
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,214
Why is it an egg?

71
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:09,786
And the last thing you want to do is turn the egg around,

72
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:11,497
that's revealing the magic right there.

73
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:13,125
Everyone's gonna know how it works then.

74
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,238
But unless you're a magician, cause if you're a magician.

75
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:18,056
I can just go like this (snaps).

76
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,346
And then you actually take that handkerchief

77
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:20,763
and just kind of.

78
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,015
- What?

79
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:24,573
Peel it off like a sticker, almost.

80
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:25,541
There we go.

81
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,903
And actually do you have that bowl for me Devon.

82
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:27,896
- Yeah.

83
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:29,090
And this is where you really freak 'em out

84
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,926
cause they think the handkerchief is still inside the egg.

85
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:31,939
But you go no, check this out.

86
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,272
We take the egg.

87
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:37,060
- No. - What?

88
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,210
(laughs)

89
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,683
That's a little bit of easy magic for you guys.

90
00:02:39,683 --> 00:02:40,516
- That's crazy.

91
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:41,349
- No way.

92
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:42,874
- What? - Oh snap.

93
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:44,346
Oh, no he didn't.

94
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:45,840
- Swerve.

95
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,797
