1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,660
- We're making three different dishes.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,350
The winner gets $10,000.

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,820
But, this cook off has a huge twist so let's go.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,820
You challenged us to make a pizza, but here's the twist.

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,210
We're not allowed to use a rolling pin,

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,980
a pan, a knife, or a can opener.

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,646
So, let's go. I've got a whole bunch of

8
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:13,550
dough cause I'm making a - Whoa!

9
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,190
Chicago deep dish pizza man. - Nice.

10
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,700
I have to cook my eggs but I can't use a hotplate

11
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,533
or a pan.

12
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:19,640
So, I'm using dry ice.

13
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,610
- Oh my gosh! That's gonna freeze an egg.

14
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,980
There's no way it's gonna cook the egg though.

15
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,910
- I guess we'll find out.

16
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,280
- Three, two, one.

17
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,420
- [Both] Oh!

18
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,138
Dude, it's sizzling, bro. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:28,971
- If you do that I'm gonna create

20
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:30,300
my Chicago deep dish, but the issue is

21
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,294
I'm not allowed to use a pan. So, I'm just gonna

22
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:32,127
have to kinda - Let's just

23
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:32,960
mold it with my hands, - get that out of the way.

24
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,843
here like this. - This is pretty cool man.

25
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:35,090
- Look at it right there man, just kind of like

26
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,130
bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh.

27
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,670
- Oh, dude! I'm gonna try to cook the egg

28
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,720
in this thing here.

29
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,260
- Yo, it's like bubbling up! - That is so cool!

30
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,373
- I gotta say, that's probably the coolest way

31
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:45,170
I've ever seen eggs cooked, man.

32
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,670
- This reminds me of a stress ball.

33
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,830
- The deep dish crust is done.

34
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,940
Next up I gotta make some rotisserie chicken right now.

35
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,210
- It totally worked! Oh!

36
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,105
- Look at this!

37
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:53,163
- Wait, just pick it up is it stuck on there though?

38
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:53,996
- It's a little stuck.

39
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:55,436
What? - Oh my gosh!

40
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:57,102
- Dude! - It looks like a saucer!

41
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:58,760
And because I'm not allowed to use a knife to slice up the

42
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,593
chicken I brought along some

43
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:00,426
wolverine claws, - Whoa!

44
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:01,870
out of my private collection, so.

45
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,020
- Wait a second, what? Yup!

46
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,754
- [Both] Three, two, one.

47
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:06,420
(yelling) - Oh! Oh!

48
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,060
and don't try this at home!

49
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,035
- Yeah, do not try this at home.

50
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:09,960
- Do not! - Here we go! Let's send

51
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,793
this off. I didn't know - Whoa!

52
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:12,040
I needed chicken, - Woo, Iron Chef!

53
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,870
- but now I do! Alright, here we go.

54
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,536
- I have a lot of chicken. - Oh my gosh!

55
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:18,200
(growling)

56
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,240
- Kind of blacked out there for a second.

57
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,073
What just happened? - That was crazy!

58
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:21,380
- You got chicken in your hair,

59
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,330
now look to the side. - Do I?

60
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,220
- And since I can't use a hot pan or a grill,

61
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,536
or anything, I gotta use two irons.

62
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:26,680
- Wait for what? - That's right

63
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,240
I'm cooking the hot dogs just like this.

64
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,190
- Oh my- oh geez!

65
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,540
That isn't really cool man. - This is totally working.

66
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,620
- You lost a dog.

67
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,076
Next up, time to slice up an onion.

68
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:35,290
(grunting and heavy breathing)

69
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,417
- Alright, my hot dogs are cooked.

70
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,250
- Alright, well you know,

71
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,560
I think it's time to retire the wolverine claws

72
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,716
and man, I gotta say these things were a ton of fun.

73
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:42,619
(growling)

74
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:43,452
- (yells)

75
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:45,702
- (growls)

76
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,680
To cook my steak, I have a brand new way of doing this.

77
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,060
We are using Gallium,

78
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,591
or should I say, liquid metal. - Wait.

79
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:52,424
And I've heated it up - what!

80
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:53,830
where the Gallium is now molten

81
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,110
It's extremely hot and we're gonna be pouring it

82
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,990
on here to see if it sears it, and cooks it.

83
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,827
- You're not gonna eat that right?

84
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:00,250
- No, you can not eat it once the Gallium has touched it,

85
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,140
we're just doing it to see if it'll actually work.

86
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,500
Do not try this at home!

87
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,333
Put some safety goggles on.

88
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,480
We got a cutting board right here.

89
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,410
We are taking this very

90
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,243
seriously. - Whoa! Gonna get out of the

91
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:08,076
- way a little bit.

92
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:09,359
- [Both] 3, 2, 1,

93
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:13,292
Ohhhh!

94
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:14,390
- No way!

95
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,240
- Listen to that, oh my gosh!

96
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
- Great job! - Yo,

97
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
I can smell it sizzling.

98
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,700
It's literally molten metal right now guys

99
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,760
on the inside of this thing. - Eww!

100
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,980
- Look at the metal's like still liquid

101
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,813
and everything dude. - Wow!

102
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:25,220
- This is definitely gonna win me the $10,000.

103
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,510
- Alright, next up I gotta roll out my dough,

104
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,690
but unfortunately, I can't use a rolling pin,

105
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,070
so I gotta use these things.

106
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,640
- Hold on, why do you have blue dough?

107
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,050
- Dude, this thing is very difficult.

108
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,883
What is going on?

109
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:36,150
- Alright, here we go, we're just gonna lather

110
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,450
some of this cheese on, just like this.

111
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,283
What are you doing?

112
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,600
- I'm trying to roll this thing out.

113
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,120
- Here we go, I've now lathered up my cheese.

114
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,010
It's time to shave it.

115
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,843
So let's see here, here we go.

116
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,030
Just gonna shave it like this.

117
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,120
- This is actually working out.

118
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,240
- Ohhh! Look at that man.

119
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,450
Cheese shaving out the wazoo bro.

120
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,320
- I'm putting the hot dog in the crust,

121
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,187
and now I'm attaching it to the crust.

122
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:53,100
- You're encrusting a hot dog. - Yes (drums)

123
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,700
Alright, my crust is done

124
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,310
and now it's time to cut up some pepperoni.

125
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,240
What are you doing?

126
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,714
- I'm brickening my cheese man.

127
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:00,130
Yeah I can't figure - You're what?

128
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,963
out how to cut it. - That's not a term!

129
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:01,958
- That absolutely is man.

130
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:02,791
That's like really clean.

131
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,360
- I hope you sanitized that brick Collins.

132
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,590
- I did man, I always clean my bricks before I use them

133
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,423
in my cooking. - Alright, time to

134
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:08,391
cut up this pepperoni.

135
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:09,780
- Wait, how you gonna, again see, how you gonna cut that up

136
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,613
without a knife. - Oh.

137
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:11,620
- You're probably gonna need to use a brick!

138
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,560
- Oh no, no, no.

139
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,290
- Uh huh - I got the best way.

140
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,750
Alright Collins, I got the saw!

141
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,750
- Yo what! You brought a full saw you'd use to

142
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,640
chop down a tree? - Yes.

143
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,310
- This does not belong in a kitchen, Devan.

144
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,680
- Here ya go. - Do not try this at home.

145
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,870
- Three, two, one

146
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,140
- [Both] Ooooh!

147
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,647
- Yes! - [Both] Yooooooo!

148
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:29,540
- $10,000 here I come. Time to get rid of the saw,

149
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,010
I think I did what I needed to do.

150
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,080
- Wait, wait, wait, what about my cheese though?

151
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,070
Okay, fine. You know what,

152
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,760
back to the brick bro, back to the brick.

153
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,310
- It's almost time to assemble our pizzas,

154
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,330
but first, I need the most important ingredient,

155
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,297
tomato sauce.

156
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,963
- while you do that, I'm gonna make some squiggly potatoes

157
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:41,796
with some squiggly scissors here.

158
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:42,650
- Oh wait! - It broke my

159
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,510
squiggly scissors.

160
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,463
- Oh, yes!

161
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:45,296
Yes! - Oh My Gosh!

162
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:46,710
- It's opening, I need something to put it in.

163
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,640
- Oh yes! - What!

164
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,650
- Squiggly potato number one.

165
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,440
It's such a little amount of tomato sauce

166
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,300
for the amount you're having to squeeze that thing dude.

167
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,480
- I know. - And the finishing touch,

168
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,970
I grab my mom's hair crimper like this,

169
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,957
and no we're gonna put this thing inside like this

170
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:58,890
and then we're gonna cook the potato

171
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,723
just like this. - What!

172
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:00,556
- Here we go! - Alright!

173
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:01,560
- I've got all the sauce I need

174
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,010
and now it's time to assemble our pizzas.

175
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:03,930
- This is like ketchup, right?

176
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,510
- Dude, that's like half of my sauce!

177
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,410
- Oh man, double dip.

178
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,243
- What're you doing?

179
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:08,620
- Alright well now let's assemble the pizzas.

180
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,700
We've got all the pizza ingredients,

181
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,610
and now it's time to assemble it.

182
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,613
So I'm gonna kick it off right here with a whole bunch of

183
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:13,533
tomato sauce man! - Same dude!

184
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,724
- Alright here we go. Three! Two! One!

185
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:17,839
(yells) - Whoa

186
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,672
- Dude this thing splattered it man!

187
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,290
- (yells) - What?

188
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,123
- I lost concentration for a sec.

189
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:23,300
- My pizza was so great. - But it got on me bro.

190
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,670
Next up, we got some of this cheese,

191
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,680
so here we go, let's just splat down the cheese like this

192
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,100
Oh yeah man! - Whoa!

193
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,170
- First layer is all done,

194
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,140
time for the second layer.

195
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,190
- Alright next up, I'm laying down

196
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,023
a base of cheddar cheese

197
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,357
- I'm putting a whole bunch of chicken

198
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,540
and onion for this layer.

199
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,540
Alright here we go man, just gonna keep pullin it in,

200
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,373
pullin it in, uh oh.

201
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:38,840
- I hope it tastes good, because

202
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,470
it doesn't look so great

203
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,303
- This is food, Devan,

204
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,940
it's not about how it looks, it's about how it tastes.

205
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,820
- Alright time to put the finishing touches on these things

206
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,700
and find out who wins the $10,000.

207
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,533
- Got the completed pizza's

208
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:50,800
and I have never seen a pizza that looks like that before.

209
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,870
Here's the big reveal, you ready?

210
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,490
- [Both] Three, two, one, ta-da!

211
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,210
- Bro! And when I slice this thing open,

212
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,240
man it's gonna be incredible on the inside.

213
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,550
You get to comment down below and vote.

214
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,300
Who's pizza do you think is gonna taste better?

215
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,133
We'll be trying them

216
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:03,850
as well as choosing the $10,000 winner

217
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,820
at the end of the video.

218
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,040
You challenged us to make a taco,

219
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,950
but we're not allowed to use a tortilla press, a knife,

220
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,360
or a griddle. So let's go!

221
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,410
Because I'm not allowed to use a griddle,

222
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,100
I'm kicking off by turning my watermelon

223
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,210
into a functioning grill right now.

224
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,043
- Wow!

225
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:16,370
- And since I can't make a normal tortilla,

226
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,740
I'm making a rice tortilla

227
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,957
- [Both] Oh! - Okay, here we go, let's go.

228
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:21,226
- Dude! (yells)

229
00:05:21,226 --> 00:05:22,180
- It's in my eye, it's in my face.

230
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,720
- Alright here we go. - Well I'm going to continue

231
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,660
- over here. - I am drenched off the bat.

232
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,500
- Instead of making normal white rice,

233
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,403
I'm making purple rice!

234
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:29,570
- That is brand new bro!

235
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,440
I've never seen a purple rice taco before.

236
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,070
That seems like it's be a lot more convenient, man.

237
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,450
- I'm really excited to see if it works.

238
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,283
- I'm confused.

239
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:36,713
- Whoa, is this cause you - Three, two

240
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:37,546
can't use a knife? - One. Oh my gosh, I feel like

241
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,890
- One. Oh my gosh, I feel like I'm using a sword right now

242
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,410
okay, (grunts)

243
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,660
- I hear it goin' - Oh snap!

244
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,493
- [Both] Dude!

245
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:44,326
- No! - Nice!

246
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:45,281
- But a perfect slice

247
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,393
off the top! - Good job!

248
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:49,110
- Come at me bro! Give me a high five! Yeah!

249
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,740
- The rice is cooked and it's cooled,

250
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,480
and now it's time to make the patty.

251
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,691
- This is called juicing from the bottom

252
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:54,954
- Careful!

253
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,340
- (yells) - Oh man!

254
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,173
- I regret nothing.

255
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,300
- Alright well now, I'm taking out my rice from the top

256
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,050
and I'm gonna lay it down on this very hot skillet thing.

257
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,490
- Wait, why? - 'Cause this is gonna

258
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,700
cook the patty dude.

259
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,533
- It's like sizzlin bro,

260
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,410
you're gonna like crisp rice though man.

261
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,243
- Exactly.

262
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,328
- (yells)

263
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,650
- What? - It ran into my armpit.

264
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,990
- Final step is to make the grilling top

265
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,270
here on the melon, so we're bringing back the drill, baby.

266
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,210
- It totally worked!

267
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,810
- Oh my, dude that's super crispy.

268
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,630
- Wait, dude what are you drilling on your watermelon?

269
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,360
- I'm gonna be grilling a whole bunch of meat for my taco.

270
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,260
- I think my purple rice is finally ready

271
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,410
to be formed into the perfect tortilla shape.

272
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,610
- Time to finish up the watermelon grill,

273
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,870
this thing is coming along amazing.

274
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,510
- My purple rice taco shell is done,

275
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,950
now it's time to slice up my pepper.

276
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,254
- Wait, so how you gonna slice that without a knife?

277
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:33,230
- [Both] Oh! - Liquid Nitrogen!

278
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,170
- Dude, this is so cool! - I know right!

279
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,840
- Oh my gosh! Do not try this at home,

280
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,020
we have a trained professional here.

281
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,490
- It's time to dunk in my pepper.

282
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,550
- Oh my gosh! - This is food grade

283
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,390
liquid nitrogen,

284
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,290
so you can actually eat whatever you put in it.

285
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,207
- [Both] Three, two, oh wait,

286
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,730
- Three second like-challenge,

287
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,910
we wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds,

288
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,870
you ready? Here we go,

289
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,670
- [Both] Three! Two! One! Done!

290
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,006
Three! Two! One! Ohhhhhhhh!

291
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:55,064
- It's like bubbling up - Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

292
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:55,897
- It's bubbling up

293
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:57,094
- Alright I gotta get it out!

294
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:58,050
- I'm gonna use the pineapple to protect myself

295
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,317
- Dude, this is definitely gonna win me the $10,000.

296
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:02,060
- And the steam is like all by my legs right now,

297
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,070
it's so cold!

298
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,340
- This is insane! - Oh my! It's like a hot bath

299
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,726
except it's freezing cold! - Whoa!

300
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,603
Look at that, it's working!

301
00:07:07,603 --> 00:07:09,620
- Dude! This is the most amount of liquid nitrogen

302
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,453
we've ever had before.

303
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:11,851
I kinda wanna freeze my pineapple now.

304
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:12,830
Can I freeze some pineapple?

305
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,913
- No, no, no, this is for me Collins.

306
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:14,746
- I just wanna freeze some pineapple.

307
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:17,430
- This is for me. You can actually knock on it right now.

308
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,710
- I have never heard a pepper that sounds like this before.

309
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,660
Man, this is- - I haven't either.

310
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,607
- so cool!

311
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,440
- [Both] Whoa!

312
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,340
- Oh my gosh! - It's already starting

313
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,173
- to crack,

314
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:25,710
alright it's ready to go. - Oh my gosh!

315
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,543
- I'm setting it down.

316
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:27,760
- It looks like it's been stuck in cryo sleep

317
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,710
for years, man. It's like coming out right now.

318
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,760
Again, do not

319
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,860
try this at home. You ready? - Yes.

320
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,633
- [Both] Three! Two! One!

321
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:34,466
(smashes pepper)

322
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,150
Ohhhhhh!

323
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,205
- Oh my gosh! - No Way!

324
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:41,038
(replay in slow motion)

325
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,840
- And this is all I need, that's perfect.

326
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,150
- That sounded like a piece of glass dude!

327
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,940
That is the best alternative to a knife I have ever seen!

328
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,353
Holy cow! - This is insane!

329
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:55,740
- Alright my first ingredient of my salsa is done.

330
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,960
Next ingredient is this mango and a drill.

331
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,640
- Wait, you're gonna put a drill in a taco?

332
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,480
- No, no, no, I'm drilling the mango.

333
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,313
- Why are you drilling the mango, bro?

334
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:04,680
- I gotta drill the mango to get the mango out

335
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,740
to put it into my salsa.

336
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,920
Now I hit reverse and we reverse outta there

337
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,160
and look at that! A little bit of mango at a time.

338
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,910
- If you can't tell, this is my not impressed face.

339
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,410
- Dude, I'm working without a knife.

340
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,830
- I'm not impressed. - Have you ever tried to make

341
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,230
salsa with just a bunch of diced up fruits and vegetables

342
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,063
without a knife?

343
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:18,896
- We're not impressed.

344
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:20,210
Next, I'm gonna pickup some piece of pork right here alright

345
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,320
let's just drop 'em in. So here we go, splash.

346
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,950
- And now I'm cracking these crab legs.

347
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,050
- I put a whole bunch of hot coals

348
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,160
inside the watermelon grill,

349
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,280
so hopefully this is gonna work.

350
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,747
- And do not try this at home.

351
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:29,680
Bro, this looks so good.

352
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,520
Three! - [Both] Two! One!

353
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,353
- Oh!

354
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:34,120
- Dude, listen to it sizzle bro!

355
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,840
- Dude! I didn't think this would work man.

356
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,010
A watermelon grill?

357
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,070
- Well what might not actually work is cracking these

358
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,280
with some bolt cutters!

359
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,250
- Wait! Bolt cutters?

360
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,940
- An employee at target told me it was a life-hack.

361
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,490
- Alright that's enough pieces of pork for right now.

362
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,490
Perfect, so now I'm gonna let those

363
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,340
cook and roast - Whoa!

364
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,140
- It fits! Oh yes!

365
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,973
- Oh my gosh!

366
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:49,806
It actually works man! - Dude!

367
00:08:49,806 --> 00:08:50,710
- Here, how about this bro, I'll help

368
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,479
you out a little bit Devan.

369
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,380
You don't need any help I guess, okay.

370
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,213
- No help needed.

371
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:55,046
- Oh snap!

372
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:56,830
Dude mine are cooking so perfectly, bro, look at this!

373
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,010
- Oh! - It's starting to come along!

374
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,843
- Yes! Look at that!

375
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:00,560
- Alright here we go, gonna press my tortilla,

376
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,840
got a tortilla pressing contraption.

377
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,970
- Dude, that is way too elaborate!

378
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,130
- You can never get too elaborate

379
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,090
when trying to press a tortilla.

380
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,620
First, I'm gonna put the two pieces of glass together

381
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,980
like this, what are you doing?

382
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,062
You got a frog man, - I got a frog.

383
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:11,710
- You're supposed to make music with that.

384
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,810
Separate the two, just like this and then plop it down.

385
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,900
- Ooh! Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep! Yeah!

386
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,733
- We have a little pump here,

387
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,610
so this pump is gonna be integral to the plans.

388
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,650
- This does not come out dude.

389
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,730
- Oh my gosh are you seeing this!

390
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,610
- Whoa!

391
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,258
- Look at this! - Dude!

392
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:26,180
- Why is it not perfectly circular though?

393
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,013
- That is amazing.

394
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:28,026
- I'm a little concerned.

395
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,160
Alright man! - Nice!

396
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,260
- There is my taco shell.

397
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,177
- That is the most impressive way

398
00:09:31,177 --> 00:09:32,920
I have ever seen a tortilla made.

399
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,753
- To cook my tortilla,

400
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,640
since we're not allowed to use a grill, I made a hot rock.

401
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,500
- Basically I stuck it in the oven, and got it super hot.

402
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,450
Do not try this at home.

403
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,700
So, let's see if it's actually able to cook my tortilla.

404
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,533
Three!

405
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,323
- [Both] Two! One! Ohhh!

406
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,230
- Oh no, I forgot to PAM the rock.

407
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,211
I gotta PAM the rock, hold on.

408
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,044
- Alright! Here we go! - Here we go!

409
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,350
- You ready? - Yup! Three! Two! One!

410
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,490
Teamwork man! - Yeah!

411
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,430
- Oh dude! It's gotten crispy!

412
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,510
- To cook my tuna, I'm actually using beeswax.

413
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,343
- Wait, beeswax?

414
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,176
- Yes. - You can cook something

415
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:56,600
with beeswax? - I guess we'll find out!

416
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,830
- [Both] Three! Two! One!

417
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,663
- Are you pouring it directly on the fish?

418
00:09:58,663 --> 00:09:59,790
- Yeah! - Oh my gosh!

419
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,520
- Yo! It hardens instantly. Keep going, keep going!

420
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,163
Oh my gosh! - This is amazing!

421
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:05,970
- Alright the wax is all hardened

422
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,674
and now it's time to break out my fish.

423
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,420
- [Both] Ohhhh!

424
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,460
- Wait a minute, it looks like congealed bologna

425
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,140
with some weird some stuff in the middle man.

426
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,210
- This doesn't look so good.

427
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,910
I gotta break it open somehow. - Yeah how you gonna do this?

428
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,156
- I don't know. Three, two, one.

429
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:17,989
- [Both] Ohhhhh!

430
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:18,930
- Oh my gosh!

431
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,630
- Dude! - It breaks away so easily.

432
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,580
- It's working out perfectly.

433
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,413
- You gotta be careful,

434
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,440
you're getting wax all on my hot rock bro.

435
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,080
You gotta be gentle with your fish man.

436
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,540
- Look it, it cooked all the way through.

437
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,600
This is the final stretch right here.

438
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,670
- Oh! Oh my gosh!

439
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,055
- Whoa! - Yo!

440
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:31,840
- That is amazing!

441
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,880
- I did not think that would work at all.

442
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,440
Got our tacos and now it's time to assemble them,

443
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,273
but first we gotta add

444
00:10:36,273 --> 00:10:37,106
some seasoning to it. - Yes!

445
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:38,280
- So check this out. So here we go.

446
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,340
(light saber sound effect)

447
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,173
- [Both] Ohhhh!

448
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,800
- Touch sabers, here we go.

449
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,870
- [Both] Oh!

450
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,903
- Flips off. Let's deactivate, there we go.

451
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:45,960
Seasoning time, see if you hold it down,

452
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,890
- What!

453
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,500
- I gotta go with the wasabi next.

454
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,680
You makin' like a like a sushi taco.

455
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
- Oh my gosh dude,

456
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,100
I still can't believe that the watermelon

457
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,290
was able to fully cook the meat.

458
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,220
Next up I'm adding this ahi tuna.

459
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,053
- Aw man! - There we go.

460
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:56,886
It's very nice and pink on the inside though.

461
00:10:56,886 --> 00:10:58,230
- I know! - Alright! Just gonna add

462
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,110
this on top.

463
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,430
- Wax cooked fish man, how it that gonna taste?

464
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,263
Alright. - Look at this though.

465
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:04,670
Alright now it's time to put the finishing touches on these

466
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,740
and find out who wins.

467
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
- Got the finished tacos.

468
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,450
- And you added a whole new element,

469
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,910
man competition is tough.

470
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,290
- We're going for $10,000 man so here's the big reveal.

471
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,660
- [Both] Three! Two! Oh yeah!

472
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,770
- Five second subscribe challenge!

473
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,450
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

474
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,127
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

475
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:20,570
You ready? Here we go!

476
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,271
- [Both] Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Done!

477
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:26,720
- If you can do that comment down below Keyper Squad,

478
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,170
right now and let's see how these look.

479
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,710
- [Both] Three, two, one, ta-da!

480
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,543
- Oh my gosh,

481
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,090
I made a little extra thingy and everything!

482
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,300
You get to comment down below - Man!

483
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,100
who's taco do you think is gonna taste better?

484
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
We'll be trying them and choosing

485
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,110
the $10,000 winner at the end of the video.

486
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,360
- You challenged us to make a burger

487
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,050
but we are not allowed to use a knife, a hotplate, or a pan,

488
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,883
so let's go!

489
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,450
To kick mine off I gotta crack some eggs,

490
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,910
- And I gotta slice up some tomatoes. Three!

491
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,562
- [Both] Two! One!

492
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:50,151
Ohhh!

493
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:51,042
- No way!

494
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:51,900
- What are you making? - I'm making the breading

495
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,300
for my chicken. Next up is for me to slice up this beef,

496
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,410
but I can't use a knife,

497
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,070
so I've got the next best thing, a paper shredder!

498
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,130
- Wait, that makes no sense

499
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,140
that's the office paper - Really?

500
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,290
shredder Devan. Wait, okay I don't

501
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,123
even think it's gonna be able to

502
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:03,620
grind up that meat to be honest bro.

503
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,453
Next up, we gotta melt the cheese,

504
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:05,483
So we got my moms wax melter over here,

505
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:06,850
just gonna place some cheese in

506
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,297
and I'm sorry mom, from now on whenever you melt wax

507
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:10,140
you're gonna smell like a little bit of cheese.

508
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,330
- Alright my beef is tenderized

509
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,960
and Collins it's time for you to hold the shredder.

510
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,820
- This is raw meat, do not touch raw meat

511
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,260
and do not try this at home!

512
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,580
- [Both] Ready? Set! Go! Oh!

513
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,610
- Snap! - Dude, it worked!

514
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,010
- It does sound kinda broken though.

515
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,440
- It's stuck, I want it back, I want my meat back.

516
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,160
- Why you can't get it! Ah, my cheese fell!

517
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,100
Look, it's starting to overflow on the top Devan.

518
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,130
I gotta say, man I did not think that this would work bro,

519
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,180
but I'm actually shocked.

520
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,720
- I'm actually kinda surprised this worked too.

521
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,980
- If this was featured in an infomercial,

522
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,040
it would be the next billion dollar product for sure!

523
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,310
You ever find yourself at 3 p.m.

524
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,160
thousands of feet above the earth in a Goodyear blimp

525
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,700
with nothing but raw meat and a paper shredder?

526
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,770
- No. - But if you did,

527
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,910
what would you wanna do with it Devan?

528
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,971
You got raw meat, - Beef basher!

529
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:43,863
- No that's not the design yet.

530
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,347
You got raw meat and you got a - Beef basher!

531
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,870
- Devan, you've got raw meat and a paper shredder

532
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,140
- Beef basher 2000!

533
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,280
- There we go! Ours!

534
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,200
Order today by calling my personal cellphone number 555

535
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,720
34 - you can't give that!

536
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,810
We're on air!

537
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,900
Got my garlic minced up,

538
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,350
I think I'm gonna make some aioli

539
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,900
and I'm gonna use this mustard next.

540
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,760
- As you make your aioli,

541
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,570
bro I'm gonna be filling my patties with cheese.

542
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,403
Alright here we go, so let's see if I can

543
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:02,420
suck up some of this cheese,

544
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,253
Three! Two! One!

545
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:04,145
- [Both] Oh!

546
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:05,700
- It's working! It's working! - Nice! Nice!

547
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,070
Gotta overpower this garlic with all the other ingredients.

548
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,410
- Oh my gosh! I'm gonna go on the side like this,

549
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,573
here we go, three, two, one,

550
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:12,050
just gonna inject the cheeese - What are you-

551
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,470
- [Both] Oh! - It's dripping out the sides!

552
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,493
- Oh boy! Okay.

553
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,560
- Time to mix my stuff up! next up gotta cook my shrimp.

554
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
- We don't have a hot plate though,

555
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,613
how you gonna cook that thing dude?

556
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:20,090
- I'm gonna use an electric fly swatter.

557
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,540
- What if it like combusts the shrimp?

558
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,460
- I guess we'll find out - It's an electric

559
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,261
fly swatter, bro! If it touches it might just go, boof!

560
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,150
(electricity crackles) - [Both] Ohhh!

561
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,486
- That was definitely a piece of shrimp.

562
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:27,520
- Alright, here we go, three!

563
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,080
- Oh my gosh! Oh boy! - Two! One!

564
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,288
- [Both] Ohhhh!

565
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,150
Ohhhhhh!

566
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,330
- I did not think that would work bro.

567
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,390
- I didn't either. - Next up I gotta chop my

568
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,030
onions, but since I have no knife,

569
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,550
I'm gonna use a figure skate!

570
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,880
- A what? How are you gonna slice it?

571
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,120
It doesn't seem that sharp man.

572
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,110
- Three! Two! One!

573
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,220
Oh yeah! - Oh my gosh!

574
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,053
If you do that, here we go!

575
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:47,207
I'm gonna pop my potato on the top here like this.

576
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:48,460
- Got in my eye!

577
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,607
- You shoot onion juice in your eye man?

578
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:51,080
- (yells) - Are you alright?

579
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,040
- So how bout this, I'm just gonna borrow

580
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,873
your skate real quick.

581
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,474
This was a much better method so here we go.

582
00:13:54,474 --> 00:13:55,307
Just gonna slice up like this,

583
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:56,680
give us a second, we gotta finish this up real quick.

584
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,670
- Dude, this no knife thing is so tough,

585
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,970
I'm gonna have to use pencil sharpeners to cut my onion.

586
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,210
- I'm having an issue with no hot plate,

587
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,410
but I think I've got a great solution,

588
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,110
a curling iron to cook my bacon.

589
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,760
And remember, do not try this at home.

590
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,560
- Oh! You hear the sizzle? This works!

591
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,930
Oh my gosh just gonna take it off,

592
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,880
and just gonna place it down here, you ready

593
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,561
- [Both] Three! Two! One!

594
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,282
(mumbling)

595
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:15,810
- Oh, gonna curl up a few more of those

596
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,300
and then it's time to assemble the burger.

597
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,320
- Time to dredge my chicken. - Dredge it?

598
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,540
- So, I'm just gonna dip it in here first

599
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,420
- That's called dredging?

600
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,940
- And then they go right in to here.

601
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,850
- Wait, ew my gosh .

602
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,930
- What do you mean, "Ew my gosh"?

603
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,763
This is gonna be amazing!

604
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:27,480
- I don't know man, it's kinda questionable.

605
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,313
- Alright this is my last piece of chicken.

606
00:14:28,313 --> 00:14:30,340
- I've got my cheese-filled burger patties,

607
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,590
and now it's time to cook these in a very unique way.

608
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,910
You ready Devan? - I'm so ready.

609
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,400
- I'm sure this is gonna blow your minds,

610
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,140
so right now let's hop outside.

611
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,697
We have a Lamborghini here,

612
00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:40,050
which was lent to us by our friend Chris.

613
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,810
We're gonna be cooking the meat in two different ways.

614
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,090
Number one, is on the engine

615
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,730
and number two is on the tailpipes.

616
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,298
- Here we go. Three! Two! One! - Oh man!

617
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:48,131
(car engine revs) - Dude!

618
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,707
- Oh my gosh! - What!

619
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:50,860
I've got the burger meat and now it's time

620
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,030
to see if it will actually cook. Do not try this at home.

621
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,270
So here we go, lemme get 'em in position.

622
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,533
- [Both] Three! Two! One!

623
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:57,857
(car engine revs) Oh!!!!

624
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:00,800
- Oh my gosh! Dude! it is so hot right now,

625
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,970
I can feel the heat coming off.

626
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,119
(elevator music)

627
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,590
Alright that's enough right now for the burgers, Devan.

628
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,423
So, next up we're gonna see

629
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:07,256
the tailpipe can cook your chicken.

630
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,868
Alright. Three! Two! One!

631
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,393
(car engine revs) - Dude! What?

632
00:15:12,393 --> 00:15:13,226
This is insane!

633
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:15,170
(elevator music)

634
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,003
- Done! Alright!

635
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:17,557
- Alright. My chicken's looking super crispy dude.

636
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:19,033
- And the burgers are almost done,

637
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:20,410
so we're just gonna be cookin 'em a little bit more

638
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,040
and then we'll be adding these to our burgers.

639
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,300
Now surprisingly, this didn't work,

640
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,500
so we actually had to put it in the oven.

641
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,840
It's now time to assemble the burgers,

642
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,220
so I gotta say, off the bat bro,

643
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,053
my bun - What?

644
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,163
turned out so good!

645
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:31,560
- Mine looks so boring in comparison.

646
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,393
- It truly is,

647
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:34,180
I really hope these unconventional cooking techniques work

648
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,980
'cause I wanna win the $10,000 so bad man

649
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,850
- Dude, same.

650
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,890
- For my burger patty,

651
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,120
remember this thing is filled with cheese.

652
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,450
Yo, dude yours actually turned out really good.

653
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,910
Next up, we're gonna get some pickles on there,

654
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,040
'cause you gotta get some salty, crispy, crunchiness on it,

655
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,300
then of course we've got the spirally bacon.

656
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,540
Time to put the finishing touches on out burger

657
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,070
and I'm really excited to see who's looks better,

658
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,690
but more importantly, who's tastes better.

659
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,220
So right now let's finish these things up.

660
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,053
We've got the burgers

661
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,264
and I say mine is definitely worth the $10,000.

662
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:58,530
- I don't know man, I think mine is.

663
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,363
- So here's the big reveal!

664
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:00,196
- [Both] Three! Two! Oh wait!

665
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:03,210
- If you wanna win a 15 minute video call with Devan and I,

666
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,490
text the word "eat" to 81800 right now,

667
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,670
so pause the video, text the word "eat" to 81800,

668
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,040
you'll automatically be entered in to win,

669
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,270
and lets see how these turned out.

670
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,660
- [Both] Three! Two! One! Ta-da!

671
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,710
- You get to comment down below,

672
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,450
who's burger do you think is gonna taste better,

673
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,283
We'll be tasting them,

674
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:18,470
and choosing the $10,000 winner at the end of the video.

675
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,040
It's time to find out, which pizza tastes better.

676
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,490
We have two very different pizzas,

677
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,174
mine you got a whole bunch of layers to it.

678
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:24,271
It's extremely heavy,

679
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:25,180
dude, feel it. It's like, - Yeah. That looks

680
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,150
really heavy, okay - Oh my god

681
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,033
it's like 20 pounds bro.

682
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,840
- It's not that, yeah that's really heavy.

683
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,673
- Are you kidding me bro?

684
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:31,580
That's extremely heavy and you've got a blue pizza

685
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,830
so it's gonna be really interesting to see

686
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,700
which one tastes better.

687
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,430
Devan, which pizza should we taste first?

688
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,500
- Let's taste yours dude,

689
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,350
I really wanna see what's on the inside of that.

690
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,040
- Here we go, do not try this at home.

691
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,753
Here we go time to slice this open, three! Two! One!

692
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:43,950
- Not too quick. Not too quick - Yeah, okay

693
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,783
here we go, okay.

694
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:46,580
- Now open it. Open it up. I wanna see what's inside.

695
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,260
- [Both] Three! Two! One!

696
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,493
Ohhhhh! - Oh my gosh!

697
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:51,090
- That looks so good!

698
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,558
- Dude, you can see the layers man, it's perfect.

699
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:55,150
- Dude! - Alright, here you go Devan.

700
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,360
Here is your piece.

701
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,193
- Oh, thank you.

702
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:58,226
- That's your piece right there.

703
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,170
- I didn't know I wanted such a big piece.

704
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,517
- It's a two slice pizza guys,

705
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,930
it's kind of a Chicago deep dish tradition

706
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,370
wait, so seriously that's all you're gonna do,

707
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,220
just a forkful?

708
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,167
- Yes, what are you doing here?

709
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,465
- I'm just trying to turn it around

710
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:08,298
so I can get a bite of it.

711
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:09,656
- It's gonna fall out. - Okay, here we go.

712
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:10,489
- (screams) It's coming out!

713
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,572
- [Both] Three! Two! One!

714
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:15,238
- Mmm! - Whoa!

715
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:16,296
- Mmm! - Whoa!

716
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,129
- Mmm! - Mmm!

717
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:18,400
- That is super good!

718
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,502
- Oh my gosh, two thumbs up!

719
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:22,350
(mumbles) the barbecue sauce.

720
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,010
- Dude, I did not wanna like that,

721
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,540
but that was so good! Nicely done!

722
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,610
- It's like a smurf pizza man. - What do you mean dude?

723
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,650
- You're breaking the middle,

724
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,205
oh my gosh Devan come on, clean slice!

725
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:33,880
I got mine perfectly clean, Devan

726
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,713
you're being judged on this man.

727
00:17:34,713 --> 00:17:36,580
- This is a little bit more difficult than I expected.

728
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,270
- A dry ice egg man, you put an egg on a pizza once before

729
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,900
which I questioned but it actually tased really good,

730
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,733
but a dry ice egg?

731
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:44,000
- It looks like it turned out though didn't it?

732
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,270
- It has a weird like texture and quality to it,

733
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,220
I can't quite put my finger on it,

734
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,879
but it's not quite the most appetizing look.

735
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:49,910
- I don't know if you're looking at the

736
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,780
same thing I'm looking at.

737
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,050
- Oh, I definitely am man.

738
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,250
- Here's the first slice. Collins you can have the honors.

739
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,140
- Oh, see you missed the egg!

740
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,600
Your blue crust is um-

741
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
- Is what? Fantastic? Amazing? Like the ocean?

742
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,215
Reminds you of everything good in the world?

743
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,060
- Suspicious.

744
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,893
- Here you go Collins.

745
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:04,730
- Yep, be very careful

746
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,320
- Here is your, yep, there ya go.

747
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,160
Time for my slice.

748
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,250
- Wait, why do you get a bigger slice than

749
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,460
I do man? - I did?

750
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,980
- If you look at the exact, okay they're the same.

751
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,930
- I tried to make it pretty equal.

752
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:12,763
- They're the same, they're the same, okay I take it back.

753
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:14,130
- I did a good job on this.

754
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,213
- [Both] Three! Two! One!

755
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:20,870
- (coughs) - Whoa! Whoa!

756
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,040
- It's so bad it makes you wanna do kung fu.

757
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,579
Wow! hat's like a weird combo man.

758
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:26,412
(mumbles)

759
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:27,245
- Why?

760
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,732
- [Both] (laugh)

761
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,480
- That was like some really good elements,

762
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,330
like the pepperoni,

763
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,163
- Yeah! - the cheese,

764
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:33,660
I gotta say man, the crust, the blue crust

765
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,620
- Yeah - No!

766
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,550
You get to comment down below

767
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,290
and vote who's pizza do you think won this round.

768
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,980
We'll be announcing the $10,000 winner

769
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,700
at the end of the video. We've got the completed burgers,

770
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,650
and now it's time to find out

771
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,880
which one is worthy of the $10,000 prize.

772
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,070
How bout we start with yours first

773
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,903
- I'm super ready!

774
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:47,310
- What really makes these burgers interesting

775
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,160
is that they were cooked using

776
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,993
a Lamborghini, so it might - I know!

777
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:50,047
change the whole taste of 'em.

778
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,180
The chicken was right by the tailpipes man,

779
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,850
just taking a whole bunch of heat from the car.

780
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,610
- Alright I think I'm gonna cut it in half first.

781
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,443
- With a fork and,

782
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:58,370
I've never seen someone just cut a burger just...

783
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,030
- Alright here we go, going down the center.

784
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,090
- Dude, the shrimp, I forgot, with the electric fly swatter.

785
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,940
Man, just zappin it, I don't know if it cooked it or not.

786
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,770
- Yeah - Oh, there goes a shrimp,

787
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,340
You lost one. - This is a tough one man.

788
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,910
- Alright here we go, gonna try and sink my slice. Ready?

789
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,800
All right. - Yeah

790
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,875
- What are you pushing it into mine for?

791
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,708
- Three, two,

792
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,840
- Hold up, what are you three, two, one-ing?

793
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,960
- I'm revealing your burger!

794
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,970
You have a lot of full onions in here, man.

795
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,530
- Yeah, it was more for aesthetics.

796
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,220
- Oh my gosh, it's all sliding apart Devan.

797
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,570
I gotta say in terms of construction,

798
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,740
this burger gets a B minus.

799
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,440
Can I order this burger without onions?

800
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,520
Can I just take the onions off please?

801
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,920
- I'm the chef and I think you should eat it

802
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,780
the way the chef prepared.

803
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,613
- Here we go

804
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:29,446
- what are you doing?

805
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:30,770
- I'm not taking off the onions, it just fell off.

806
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,670
- Uh-huh, really?

807
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,503
Yeah - on purpose.

808
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:33,473
Oh wait, now I lost the bottom bun, hold on Devan.

809
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:36,470
- Really? You're so much drama man! Just eat it.

810
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,493
- [Both] Three! Two! One!

811
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,889
- Once you get all the flavors, it's not so bad.

812
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:46,653
- It made me do a little "Hmm".

813
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:47,486
- Yeah, I like that.

814
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,590
Got some cheese, you know, got some burger.

815
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,680
- I gotta say that was really good,

816
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,090
once you get past the initial onion man,

817
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,094
it was delicious - Yeah. That was actually,

818
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:54,927
really, really good. - Here we go.

819
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,007
- Time to slice down from the top man,

820
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:57,570
but do not try this at home.

821
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,870
- Oh man, the cheese!

822
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,703
- Three,

823
00:19:59,703 --> 00:20:01,183
- [Both] Two, one.

824
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:02,016
Ohhhh!

825
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:03,120
- Look at the cheese!

826
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,953
- Whoa!

827
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,620
Bro, it's all wet and slimy.

828
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,630
- I'm just doing my best to make a great burger, man.

829
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,960
Right now let's see how this cheese-filled,

830
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,379
Lamborghini-grilled burger tastes. Three!

831
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:12,513
- [Both] Two! One!

832
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:16,099
- Oh - What?

833
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:18,550
- It's so dry, it's like a saltine cracker.

834
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,730
- The pickles taste really good.

835
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,620
You get to comment down below

836
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,867
and vote who's burger won this round,

837
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,040
and we'll be finding out who wins the $10,000

838
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,010
at the end of the video.

839
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,020
We've got the completed tacos,

840
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,647
and now it's time to find out which one is worthy of $10,000

841
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:29,480
and just remember,

842
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,020
we grilled the meat on a watermelon,

843
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,016
so it might change the whole flavor

844
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:32,849
of this thing - Oh, yeah!

845
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:34,592
- This thing's in a taco bowl that was made by a hot rock.

846
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:36,150
Alright I don't know how we do this, do we just,

847
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,910
I've never eaten a taco bowl whole before.

848
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,860
- I'll grab my fork and knife

849
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,330
- Oh, yeah you wanna split it in half?

850
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,663
You did do a good job of cutting these things man.

851
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:43,341
- Thank you, wait cutting what?

852
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:44,174
- Of cutting these!

853
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:45,100
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right, thank you.

854
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,585
My art on the side is definitely (kissing sound)

855
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:48,950
You're opening this thing up and not in the best way, man.

856
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,190
It started off as a taco bowl,

857
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,650
and it's turned into a regular taco.

858
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,660
Alright so I guess on the count of three

859
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,989
we'll see how this thing tastes, you ready? Three!

860
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:56,053
- [Both] Two! One!

861
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:00,517
- Oh yeah!

862
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:06,610
- You know what, I didn't think the flavors blended,

863
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,340
but they really do!

864
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,360
I think that watermelon actually really helped

865
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,370
with the fruity flavor.

866
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,150
- Yours is gonna have a tall mountain to climb

867
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,530
if it looks to beat this one here.

868
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,410
Yeah, the pomegranate seeds

869
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,630
like tied the whole dish together.

870
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,770
So now Devan, time to find out how yours tastes.

871
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,360
- Yeah, mines got a rice taco shell,

872
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,680
prepared in a coffeemaker.

873
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,880
- That's not even the craziest thing bro,

874
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,130
you have fish that's been cooked in hot wax.

875
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,380
- I think this is gonna taste great.

876
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,850
- I don't know man.

877
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,290

885
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,833
Here we go.

886
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,363
- Three! Two! One!

887
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,612
- Alright oh, that doesn't look good.

888
00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:50,449
- (mumbles)

889
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:51,649
- The wasabi! - Ohhhhh!

890
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:58,190
- Oh my gosh, automatic disqualification, trash!

891
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,600
- It just overpowered the whole thing.

892
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,740
- You get to comment down below, who's taco won this round.

893
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,300
Now it's time to find out who won the $10,000.

894
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,620
There were three different dishes,

895
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,036
and I gotta say Devan, you definitely won the burger dish.

896
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:08,869
- Oh yeah, definitely.

897
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,702
- That was all yours, but the taco dish,

898
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:11,829
that was mine right there - Yes, unfortunately

899
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:13,920
- And what it all comes down to is the pizza dish,

900
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,110
so mine, I gotta say, a lot of really unique flavors,

901
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,960
but all-in-all it had multiple different layers

902
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,650
of all it's goodness within - yeah, but presentation

903
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,570
was super weak.

904
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,950
- Okay yeah, I gotta say the blue crust

905
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,635
was definitely a nice touch on yours, egg in the middle

906
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,230
- Yeah, mine looked the part.

907
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,850
It looked like $10,000

908
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,270
- But ultimately it comes down to taste, Devan.

909
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,103
- Yeah

910
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:33,260
- And if we're jusdging based on taste,

911
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,360
I think you know the answer.

912
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,830
- Unfortunately, I don't think mine was the greatest.

913
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,380
- Therefore - so I think, you won!

914
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,600
- Yes! I won the $10,000! - Nicely done!

915
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,190
