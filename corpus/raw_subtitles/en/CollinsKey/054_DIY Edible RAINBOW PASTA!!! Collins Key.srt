1
00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:01,460
- What's up? It's Collins Key.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,995
And for today's video I'm back at it again

3
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:04,473
with a brand new DIY.

4
00:00:04,473 --> 00:00:07,227
And today I'm doing a DIY Rainbow Pasta.

5
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:08,934
And I made the very poor decision to wear a white shirt

6
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:11,411
while doing a rainbow DIY video.

7
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:12,579
So there's gonna be a lot of food coloring,

8
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,661
so hopefully I don't mess this up

9
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:15,346
because I literally put this on for the first time today.

10
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,221
And I like it, and I don't wanna mess it up.

11
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:19,193
So yeah, that's what we're gonna be doing for today's video.

12
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,253
We have cheese, so yeah, we have cheese!

13
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:23,209
If you want me to do another DIY video on my channel

14
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:24,629
let me know by liking this video.

15
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:25,965
And if this video gets enough thumbs up

16
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:28,356
then I'll do another crazy DIY video.

17
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:29,362
Also wanna let you guys know

18
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,060
that I'm giving away an iPhone 7

19
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,849
and all you have to do if you want to win this

20
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:34,319
are two very easy steps.

21
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:37,327
Step number 1, you have to download an app called Live.me

22
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:38,843
which is a free live-streaming app

23
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:40,614
that I like to stream on all the time.

24
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:42,179
I'm gonna put the download link for that

25
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,656
in the description down below.

26
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:45,765
So make sure you use that link in the description

27
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:48,375
otherwise you will not be entered in to the giveaway.

28
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,208
And for step number 2

29
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,317
all you have to do is just watch my live broadcasts

30
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,617
which happen every single Sunday at 4PM PST.

31
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:57,002
Without any further ado, let's create some amazing,

32
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:58,585
that's too high expectations.

33
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:01,673
Let's create some really probably pretty good DIY pasta.

34
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:04,311
Rainbow pasta, oh wow I messed that up bad.

35
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,064
This DIY is actually really simple to make.

36
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:08,443
All you're gonna need is just pasta linguini

37
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,811
food coloring, Ziploc bags,

38
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:12,044
and if you wanna be extra fancy

39
00:01:12,044 --> 00:01:13,588
you can make some parmesan clouds.

40
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:15,712
And you guys know me on this channel, we extra fancy.

41
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:16,545
(dinging)

42
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:18,454
So what you're gonna wanna do is take your entire box

43
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:20,203
and you're gonna wanna heat up a full pot of water.

44
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:21,651
And once it starts bubbling, pro-tip,

45
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:22,851
that means it's boiling.

46
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:23,950
(gasps) Mind blown!

47
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,714
And yeah, so actually there is a pro-tip here.

48
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:27,131
While you're bringing the water to a boil,

49
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:28,454
if you add olive oil to it

50
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:30,507
that will prevent the pasta from sticking together

51
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,749
when you add it in there.

52
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:32,914
So I think the pasta needs to cook for like

53
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:34,251
around nine minutes

54
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:35,337
so yeah add the pasta in there

55
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:38,193
cook the pasta, and then we are on to step number two.

56
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:39,946
While the pasta's cooking, the fun part begins.

57
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,814
For me, this is the most dangerous part of the DIY

58
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:44,323
because this is where the food coloring comes in.

59
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:46,337
And my shirt is at jeopardy

60
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:47,707
of becoming completely destroyed.

61
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,414
So all you need for this, some Ziploc bags.

62
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:50,411
I don't know how you open it,

63
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,244
so I think I'm just gonna go like.

64
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,028
(loud bang) Ow.

65
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:55,195
That's not working at all.

66
00:01:57,795 --> 00:02:01,334
Next, remove a Ziploc bag, that was actually kind of cool.

67
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:02,547
Right now I have a challenge for you.

68
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:03,563
I wanna see if you can subscribe

69
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:04,759
to this channel in five seconds.

70
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,739
So let's try this, five, four,

71
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,572
three, two, one, done.

72
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:10,381
Were you able to do it?

73
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,555
Were you able to subscribe to this channel in five seconds?

74
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:13,437
If you were, you're a true Youtube Ninja.

75
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,110
But right now let's get in to this.

76
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,248
And now the most difficult part of the challenge

77
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:19,014
getting 20 drops of the food coloring in the Ziploc bag

78
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,290
without messing up my shirt.

79
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,790
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

80
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:25,661
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

81
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:28,035
16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

82
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:29,293
(gasps) Ran out of breath there.

83
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:30,398
And that was actually a lot easier

84
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:31,231
than I thought it would be.

85
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,943
Alright, look this stuff actually kind of looks like blood.

86
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,998
(intense music)

87
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:36,612
This DIY is going in a very different direction.

88
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:37,663
But now the next step is

89
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:39,720
you have to add two tablespoons of water

90
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,970
to what's going on, so I have,

91
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,577
that's not a tablespoon, that's like half a tablespoon.

92
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:45,586
Probably have to do four of these, but it's two tablespoons.

93
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:46,419
There we go.

94
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:48,726
Two full tablespoons right there.

95
00:02:48,726 --> 00:02:51,076
And now we have blood bag number one.

96
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:52,187
Once you're done with all your colors

97
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:53,587
your pasta is probably done cooking at this point.

98
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:55,573
So next you guys need to strain the pasta

99
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:56,844
as I've done here.

100
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,260
And now we're going to add the pasta to these bags.

101
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,133
This is the moment where my entire life

102
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,306
could come crashing down around me

103
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:04,390
if I get this dye on my clothing.

104
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,079
So, let's see here.

105
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:09,322
Oh I've never like really felt spaghetti

106
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,967
just like with my hands.

107
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,268
It feels pretty funky, so um,

108
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:14,160
I'm kind of eyeballing it here.

109
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,896
Don't know exactly how much there is.

110
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:19,979
I'm actually getting really excited as this DIY goes on.

111
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:21,395
This is gonna look so cool.

112
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:22,725
So now what you do is you just kind of

113
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:24,642
mix it all up in there.

114
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,660
And then you're just gonna let it sit for one minute

115
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,709
as you add all the other colors.

116
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,328
Yo this looks!

117
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:33,206
Okay, actually it looks kinda like kale.

118
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:35,456
(rustling)

119
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:39,945
This looks so cool!

120
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:42,102
So, next all you can do is just take your completed bags

121
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:44,691
of colored pasta and strain them under cold water.

122
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,747
And hopefully they'll still remain the same color,

123
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:47,851
so I guess we'll just find out.

124
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:49,761
No rainbow would be complete without a cloud.

125
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:52,241
So right now we're gonna make our very own parmesan clouds

126
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,320
and this is very important

127
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,868
that you watch every little detail of how I do this,

128
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,313
because if you don't do this properly

129
00:03:57,313 --> 00:03:58,423
it will not turn out right.

130
00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:01,592
So step number one, you need to coat your pan with oil.

131
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:04,828
(quiet buzzing)

132
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,092
(soft coughing)

133
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:07,936
Next place the parmesan on the pan.

134
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:10,129
Some chefs will spend upwards of 10 years

135
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:12,129
mastering the technique.

136
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:33,808
If you don't get the same results when you first try this

137
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:36,236
don't worry I've been practicing this for many years.

138
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:37,844
Nah I'm just kidding, this is probably the easiest part

139
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,397
of the entire DIY and somehow I managed to mess it all up.

140
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:41,310
So the real question is

141
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,981
do you wanna eat boring pasta like this?

142
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,064
Or like this?

143
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:49,047
Oh my gosh! I can only, yeah definitely not on that pasta!

144
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:50,893
This pasta looks amazing!

145
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:52,628
I gotta admit the cheese clouds actually turned out

146
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:54,231
to look really really cool.

147
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:57,674
So now this right here is DIY rainbow pasta.

148
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:59,221
So give this video a thumbs up for the fact that

149
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:01,076
I think this is the first DIY I've ever done

150
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:02,578
that actually worked all the way.

151
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:04,416
So right now it's time to make the rainbow.

152
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,153
We're about to mix it all together and just give it a try.

153
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:08,355
Before I mix this whole thing up

154
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:09,748
and turn it in to a giant rainbow,

155
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:11,112
make sure you guys subscribe to this channel

156
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:12,069
that'd really mean a lot to me.

157
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,886
But right now all I need is just a fork.

158
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:16,065
Whoa no, that's way too big, get that out of there!

159
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,898
We can not use that.

160
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:18,552
This fork here is a little bit more manageable.

161
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,463
So right now let's create a true rainbow.

162
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:24,463
Let's see, let's just kind of mix it all around.

163
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:29,222
Oh my gosh this looks so so awesome.

164
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,832
Alright guys, well this has been a super fun video

165
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,499
and now bon appetit!
