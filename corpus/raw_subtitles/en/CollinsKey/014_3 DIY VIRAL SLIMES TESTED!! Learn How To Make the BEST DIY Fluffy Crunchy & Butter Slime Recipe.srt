1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:01,218
- [Both] Oh!

2
00:00:02,094 --> 00:00:02,927
- My gosh.

3
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,276
You challenged us to test

4
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:07,305
a whole bunch of Instagram famous slimes

5
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:09,552
and we're kicking it off with the most requested one.

6
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:10,611
- [Both] Butter slime.

7
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,406
- Oh no, no.

8
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:13,997
No, no no you don't.

9
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:15,264
- I was so close.

10
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:17,056
- You will not be doing that.

11
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:19,965
(laughing)

12
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:22,543
Ew okay, okay stop it, stop it.

13
00:00:22,543 --> 00:00:24,095
Okay lesson learned.

14
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:26,875
If you're inside, this is not a messy challenge.

15
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:27,737
Truce?

16
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:28,570
- And truce.

17
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,820
- Take my hand.

18
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:33,372
Truce.

19
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:35,039
- Truce. - All right.

20
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:38,326
Now that we're all cleaned off,

21
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:40,958
Devan you have officially lost your shaving cream privileges

22
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,782
and step number one for the butter slime needs,

23
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:44,675
where'd you get that?

24
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,330
Okay so step number one you got to add the glue to,

25
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,599
are you kidding me?

26
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:49,701
- You never know when,

27
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,001
might, might go.

28
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:51,834
You never know.

29
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:53,847
- So guys step number one you're going to add the glue.

30
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:54,908
- Some glooby glue.

31
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:56,131
- Gloop gloop gloop gloob.

32
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,561
- Whoop whoop whoop try saying

33
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:58,394
that 10 times fast.

34
00:00:58,394 --> 00:00:59,767
- Glooby glue, glooby glue, glooby glue,

35
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:00,746
gloob gloob gloob gloob.

36
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:02,255
(hollering)

37
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:04,012
- All right next up, baking soda.

38
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:04,871
- No shaving cream.

39
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:06,136
- Oh. - Tips of these.

40
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:07,154
- All right.

41
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:08,704
(pounding)

42
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,544
- [Announcer] Two hours later.

43
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:12,673
(pounding)

44
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:13,693
- How's that working out for ya?

45
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:14,526
- Not too good.

46
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:15,518
Boom.

47
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:17,358
Add it in, sha boinks, okay.

48
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:18,191
Next up.

49
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:19,519
Oh my gosh.

50
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,726
Baking soda, he got baking soda.

51
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:23,525
- No, that joke's from like 2015.

52
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:24,585
- Yeah but you got it on your shirt

53
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,810
so it's, that's still funny.

54
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,826
All right so let's see we're just going to grab

55
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:28,659
a little teaspoon out.

56
00:01:29,832 --> 00:01:30,812
Ha.

57
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:32,199
My mouth is like foaming bro.

58
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,032
(pounding)

59
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:35,340
Baking soda, I taste baking soda.

60
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,358
We have to do one more. - Taking it back in.

61
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:37,992
- That's not sanitary. - No it's not.

62
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:40,486
- Okay next up, two tablespoons of contact solution.

63
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:43,345
- Next up we have to mix it til it's marshmallowy.

64
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:44,610
(moan)

65
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,505
(trilling)

66
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,359
- Getting nice and marshamllowy, whoa ha ha.

67
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,379
Nice dude.

68
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,212
The thing about these slimes,

69
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:51,045
like I've seen these things blowing up

70
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,599
all over Instagram and I really want

71
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,735
to test to see whether they're actually legit.

72
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:57,682
Yo this is some crazy feeling slime.

73
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,116
It feels like a sh'more.

74
00:01:59,116 --> 00:01:59,949
- Really?

75
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:00,784
- Like a marshmallow. - Like a sh'more.

76
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:02,866
- A sh'more, we're creating our own vocabulary.

77
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:03,984
We're like Shakespeare.

78
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:07,247
- Slight deviation from the normal vocabulary.

79
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:08,080
(laughing)

80
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,533
- [Blonde] It feels super bizarre.

81
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,573
- [Devan] Oh it does, it feels like a marshmallow actually.

82
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:12,922
- It's not slimy but like it looks

83
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:13,987
like you would want to bite into it.

84
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:16,045
Okay so next step Devan is to add the clay

85
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:17,436
and that's how we turn this

86
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:19,601
from mush mallows into booter slyme.

87
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:20,434
Now put it in the center.

88
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:21,267
- Okay.

89
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,401
- [Blonde] Okay and then yes nice, smoosh it it.

90
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,234
- Oh.

91
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:25,478
- I can hear it popping inside, that's crazy.

92
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,718
- Oh this feels so good.

93
00:02:27,718 --> 00:02:28,865
- Let's do this, let's split it in half

94
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,052
that way we can go double time on it.

95
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:31,156
I'll take half, whoa.

96
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:32,344
We've got two different strats right now.

97
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:34,219
I'm going to go for adding a bigger mound of clay,

98
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:35,248
he's going for smaller amount.

99
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:36,473
- And I'm going for a more modest amount.

100
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:37,654
Let's go.

101
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:39,323
- There you go he's going to push it in.

102
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:42,573
(old time piano music)

103
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:49,703
Oh that look he worked out so well.

104
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,536
When you kind of spread to begin with

105
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,186
'cause it doesn't get all clumpy then in the middle.

106
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:54,188
It just like really mixes right into it.

107
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:55,021
- That's a good idea.

108
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:55,854
- Oh.

109
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:57,499
So my butter slime is all ready

110
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:58,970
and Devan's didn't

111
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,644
quite turn out. - No it's not so great.

112
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:02,074
It just crumbles apart.

113
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:03,744
- Oh my gosh this looks so cool.

114
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:04,682
- Oh you nailed it.

115
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:05,624
It looks so good.

116
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:06,457
- It looks crazy.

117
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:08,024
So now we're going to add the yellow dye to it

118
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:09,532
and that way it's going to now look like butter

119
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:10,419
and then we're going to try to do

120
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,477
the ultimate butter slime test

121
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:12,581
which is like

122
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,844
spread it with a knife.

123
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:14,738
There we go, for for it.

124
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:16,749
All right that's enough, that's enough that's enough.

125
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:18,387
- Your whole hands are all yellow.

126
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,065
Oh my gosh. - I fail all across the board.

127
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:22,108
- This slime is crazy how much is actually resembles butter.

128
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:22,941
- [Devan] Whoa.

129
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:23,774
- You can see it's starting

130
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:25,455
to like come through a little bit.

131
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,807
- Mine looks like cheese.

132
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:27,863
- [Blonde] Yo.

133
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:28,761
- [Devan] Oh that looks...

134
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:30,632
- This looks seriously like butter.

135
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:32,226
- It looks just like butter.

136
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:33,734
- Oh my gosh.

137
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,528
This is insane.

138
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,647
- [Both] Whoa oh.

139
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:38,480
(cracking)

140
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,313
- Oh.

141
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:41,850
Darn it.

142
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,395
All I want is for my slime to be just

143
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:44,627
like yours Collin.

144
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:46,628
- Devan crushes me at like the pancake challenge

145
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:47,488
which is all art,

146
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:48,634
but then when it actually comes to the hands on

147
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:50,103
craft stuff this is the first time

148
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:52,059
I've ever like done it better than he has.

149
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,162
I'm shocked.

150
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:53,995
Flabbergasted.

151
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:55,236
- Are you going to try and flip it around.

152
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,516
- What, why would you do that my butter slime.

153
00:03:57,516 --> 00:03:59,232
Now for the ultimate test.

154
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:00,371
Will it butter?

155
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,390
- I think it'll spread.

156
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,264
Hold on I just I want to cut it first.

157
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:04,816
- [Collin] Oh that went well.

158
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,695
- And then I'm just going to put this on there

159
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:10,409
and then see if it will spread, no.

160
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,271
Unh unh.

161
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:13,969
Nope, that did not really work at all.

162
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:14,802
- I dare you to take a bite

163
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:16,165
out of the toast with it.

164
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:17,348
With the butter on it.

165
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,287
- You do? - Yeah.

166
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:19,959
- Well after you smacking me in the face

167
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,042
with shaving cream, I don't think so.

168
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,137
Hold up where mine really excels

169
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,304
is bounciness.

170
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:30,931
See look at it.

171
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:31,910
- Mine does the same thing dude.

172
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,132
Yeah mine does the same thing.

173
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:33,965
- No it's just not like mine.

174
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:35,003
- Oops I lost my butter.

175
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:37,200
- See mine just has this extra spring

176
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,617
to it that-- - Ow.

177
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:41,281
Just a nice little thing of butter here.

178
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,217
Let me see if I can just...

179
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:43,050
- Spread it?

180
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,133
- [Collin] Yeah we'll go from like right around here.

181
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,216
- [Devan] Oh.

182
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:47,848
- [Collin] The satisfaction.

183
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:49,196
- That's nice.

184
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:51,114
Where did mine go so wrong?

185
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,996
- This is like so satisfying.

186
00:04:52,996 --> 00:04:55,036
Like I literally I did not think that slime

187
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:56,833
would actually be able to spread like butter

188
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,442
but oh my gosh this just looks so cool.

189
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:00,835
It looks just like butter.

190
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,418
Like this is crazy.

191
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:05,131
Okay okay okay okay.

192
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:07,334
We just made the most satisfying butter slime

193
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,295
of all time, what are you doing?

194
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:11,772
The next one we are doing is called crunchy slime

195
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:13,529
and it's kind of on the opposite end

196
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,605
of the spectrum but still just as satisfying.

197
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:16,541
Glue me Devan.

198
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,643
- I got,

199
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:18,743
chu bro.

200
00:05:18,743 --> 00:05:21,605
Yo this is so cool, there's so many crunchy balls.

201
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:22,585
- And this was actually suggested

202
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:23,686
by the Instagram keyper of the week,

203
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:25,155
so shout out to you and if you want to be featured

204
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:26,299
as the Instagram keyper of the week,

205
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,296
check the description down below to find out how

206
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:29,755
but all of you commented and let us know

207
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:31,755
that you wanted us to make this slime pink

208
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,186
so we got the pink dye

209
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:34,939
and let's add it in right now.

210
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:38,086
The spoon of destiny is going to mix it all around.

211
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:41,336
(old time piano music)

212
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:44,620
This looks like strawberry yogurt.

213
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,809
- Oh it does.

214
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,729
- It's crazy how one color

215
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,592
can make glue look like the most delicious food

216
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:51,601
in the entire world.

217
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,576
I low key want to eat glue right now.

218
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:54,409
- I don't.

219
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,507
Next up is this Sta-Flo. - Sta-Flo.

220
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:57,874
- And this one you just eyeball it

221
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,780
and then pray for the best.

222
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,525
- If you ever wondered how to make slime,

223
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:02,519
we don't know.

224
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,719
So we eyeball it.

225
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,963
Oh my gosh. - Oh, no.

226
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:05,796
- This does not look good.

227
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:06,629
It went from looking so delicious

228
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,189
to like expired.

229
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,012
Devan hit me with some more Sta-Flo.

230
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:10,845
- [Devan] There you go.

231
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:11,678
- That's perfect.

232
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:12,511
- [Devan] Yeah it's getting pretty solid.

233
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:14,729
- Oh. - It looks so cool.

234
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,389
- Making slime is so much fun.

235
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,206
Like it's truly a passion of mine.

236
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:20,539
(raspberry)

237
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,528
(laughing)

238
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:23,641
That was the best attempt we've had yet.

239
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:24,631
- It was like bubblegum.

240
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:25,583
- So I think next it's time

241
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,029
to add the crunchy elements to it.

242
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,899
- All right.

243
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:28,931
(slapping)

244
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,181
Air drop. - Oh.

245
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:32,214
Just sticks to it.

246
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:33,210
Give him some more.

247
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,043
Oh, wow.

248
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:37,612
- Oh. - Hey.

249
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:38,604
They just stick.

250
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:39,437
Ah that's so funny.

251
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:40,965
This is so much fun.

252
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,669
I'm just going to chuck all of these.

253
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,107
- No, no no no. - All right you ready.

254
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:47,970
Oh the mess is so worth it.

255
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,374
- [Collin] I think we're just going to close him up.

256
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,867
- [Devan] Trying to make his head.

257
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:52,019
- Here we go.

258
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,686
Oh, this is so cool.

259
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:58,034
Bloop, bloop bloop, blue la loop.

260
00:06:58,034 --> 00:06:59,399
I got to admit like this is cool,

261
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,178
but it's not like crunchy.

262
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:02,671
- I feel like we should add this one.

263
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:03,504
- All right here we go.

264
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:04,618
Oh, ah ho ho.

265
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,690
Oh that looks so cool.

266
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,103
All right don't drop any Collins.

267
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:10,752
It's you know I'm over here being really clean

268
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:11,659
and neat and tidy.

269
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:12,492
- Oh I can tell.

270
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:13,889
This reminds me of the candy slime we made,

271
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:15,199
it's just you can't eat this one,

272
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,897
but like just with all the little things in there

273
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:18,096
looks like you could eat it.

274
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:20,372
- [Devan] Oh that sounds so cool.

275
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:22,039
- [Both] Oh my gosh.

276
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,390
- [Devan] This stuff is so cool.

277
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,557
(popping)

278
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,150
- All right let's stretch it out.

279
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,130
Wait wait wait, but first,

280
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:32,963
we've got a challenge.

281
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:34,697
I want to see if you can subscribe to this channel,

282
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:36,724
turn on your channel post notifications

283
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,292
and give us a thumbs up.

284
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,413
- [Both] In seven seconds.

285
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:40,406
- You ready for this?

286
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:41,239
- Yup. - Here we go.

287
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:43,056
- [Both] Seven, six, five,

288
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:45,389
four, three, two, one, done.

289
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:48,093
If you can do that comment down below,

290
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,334
keyper squad right now

291
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:50,701
and let's see how this looks.

292
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:51,534
- All right you ready.

293
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:53,951
- Yo this turned out so cool.

294
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,411
- Pow. - Whoa.

295
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:57,609
Devan, have you ever felt like

296
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,849
a fish bowl in a bowl of fish?

297
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:00,682
- No.

298
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:01,515
- Well we're about to make some slime

299
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:02,348
that resembles it.

300
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,181
- All right.

301
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,014
- This one sounds really confusing

302
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:05,519
but it's called fish bowl slime.

303
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,718
- Like which part of the fish bowl

304
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:07,631
are we making?

305
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:08,498
- I have no idea.

306
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:10,322
We're using clear glue for this one

307
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,725
and then we're also going to use some glitter.

308
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:13,720
Can you grab the baking soda Devan?

309
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,553
- Did you just say glitter?

310
00:08:14,553 --> 00:08:15,386
- I did.

311
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:16,219
- We're using glitter?

312
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:17,052
- Yeah.

313
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:18,027
- Can we skip that step?

314
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:18,860
- I didn't want to tell you about it

315
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,693
but that's what we're doing.

316
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:20,553
Devan and I are terrified of glitter

317
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:21,426
if you guys didn't know.

318
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:22,259
Two pinches now.

319
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,126
- Two, no.

320
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:24,119
- Devan's like that was a pinch.

321
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,445
- Nicely done.

322
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:26,310
- What a perfect pinch.

323
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,386
- Baking soda bae.

324
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:28,219
- Yeah.

325
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:29,254
This ain't just regular glitter bro,

326
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:30,790
this glitter's extra fine.

327
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,029
- Just do a teeny little bit, please.

328
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,862
That's perfect.

329
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:34,695
That's it, that's it.

330
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:35,528
No that's it.

331
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:36,383
- [Collin] We got to just add both of it.

332
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,457
- No, really,

333
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:38,831
that's way too much.

334
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:39,664
- Way too much okay.

335
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:40,497
- You're mixing this one.

336
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:41,816
- Now one more step before we actually turn

337
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:44,305
this into slime is these things called filler beads.

338
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:45,217
- I don't think that's how you're supposed

339
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:46,706
to open it bro.

340
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,488
- [Both] Oh.

341
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:49,528
- They're even like stuck to my shirt.

342
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,267
How does that happen?

343
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,340
- [Devan] That's it, that's it that's it.

344
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,173
- We're going to add a little bit

345
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:54,496
of contact solution at a time.

346
00:08:54,496 --> 00:08:56,194
Time to mix it up and to see how this goes.

347
00:08:56,194 --> 00:08:57,604
- [Devan] Oh you're making little bubbles.

348
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,052
But it looks so cool.

349
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:00,871
- Yo. - Whoa.

350
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:02,983
That looks like so cool. - Crazy.

351
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:04,021
- I'm not a fan of glitter,

352
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,847
but I got to admit glitter is,

353
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,092
it's kind of essential for this one.

354
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,914
This is actually, yeah this is actually really good.

355
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,488
Oh my gosh and the glitter's not coming off.

356
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:11,775
It's a holy miracle.

357
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,685
The texture of this is so crazy.

358
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,170
Like you can just, you can see all

359
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,231
the little sparkles in it and everything.

360
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:18,515
Plus the beads.

361
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:19,998
This is really crazy.

362
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:20,912
We're about to stretch it out

363
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:21,988
but if you want to be shouted out

364
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:23,519
in the next video, comment down below

365
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,221
and let us know that type of video

366
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:26,381
should we do next.

367

You ready for this, let's do it.

370
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,557
Three, two, one go for it.

371
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:34,255
- [Both] Whoa.

372
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:35,615
- My gosh.

373
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,234
(exhaling)

374
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:38,680
It's so resilient, oh my gosh.

375
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,513
- So cool.

376
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:40,667
- This stuff is crazy.

377
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:41,703
Listen to this.

378
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:43,316
(popping)

379
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,137
- [Devan] All the little beads are making these air pockets.

380
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:47,143
- I want to stick my hand through it, you ready.

381
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:48,138
- All right try it, try. - Three,

382
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:48,971
two, one.

383
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:51,744
- Oh, what.

384
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:54,472
What is going on.

385
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:55,882
- [Collin] It looks so trippy.

386
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:57,822
- It's like Saran wrap or something.

387
00:09:57,822 --> 00:09:59,261
Show the back of your hand too.

388
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:01,875
- Yo this looks crazy. - Whoa.

389
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,869
