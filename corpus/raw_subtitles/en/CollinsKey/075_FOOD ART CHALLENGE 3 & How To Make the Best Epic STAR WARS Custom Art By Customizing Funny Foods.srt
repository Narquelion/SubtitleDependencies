1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
- Your Darth Vader watermelon sculpture

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,810
is blowing my mind, so here's the reveal.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,940
- [Both] Three, two, one, what?

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,480
- You challenged us to make edible characters

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,900
from Star Wars, so let's go.

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,733
I'm making Chewbacca,

7
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:10,840
and I'm starting off with his body.

8
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,010
- Oh it's in, it's like a little shrimp

9
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,556
floating and bobbing in the ocean.

10
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,389
- That's looking good.

11
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:16,222
So I gotta curling iron

12
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:17,450
and I'm gonna make Yoga's light saber.

13
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,254
- [Both] Three, two, one!

14
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:21,500
- Oh! Whoa! - Holy cow!

15
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,100
- I think I might just leave it in here.

16
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,590
Holy cow-- - That is very far in.

17
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,550
- That is deep, harder. - Just look at the counter.

18
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,677
- Oh, my gosh. this might be

19
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,930
one of the biggest steam ups we've ever had.

20
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,840
- All right, now it's time to pour in

21
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,640
this hot liquid, and hopefully this freezes

22
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,720
into Yoda's light saber.

23
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,010
- [Both] Three, two, one, yo!

24
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,390
- [Devon] It's like a little volcano, man, holy cow!

25
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,760
- [Both] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

26
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,980
- [Collins] That's like seven whoa's!

27
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,430
Time to remove the cocoa pod.

28
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,833
- Whoa! - No!

29
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,199
- [Collins] All right man,

30
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:46,032
get the liquid nitrogen outta here,

31
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:47,130
and Devon, you know what happens next, right?

32
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,660
- Oh yeah, we smash it!

33
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,744
- [Both] Three, two, one!

34
00:00:49,744 --> 00:00:50,782
(glass shattering)

35
00:00:50,782 --> 00:00:52,950
Oh! - Oh my gosh!

36
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,150
- [Collins] I've gathered all the cocoa pods,

37
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,553
and I'll be using this for the body of Chewbacca.

38
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:56,620
- I've just got to pull out

39
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,652
the light saber like this.

40
00:00:57,652 --> 00:00:58,690
(grunting)

41
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,821
- It's like King Arthur man,

42
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:00,770
You can't get the sword out.

43
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,640
- [Devon] Okay, I think I just

44
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,240
have to break out the ice around it.

45
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,000
- Why go one at a time and very softly,

46
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,400
When you could go like this!

47
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,600
- Boom, boom, boom, boom!

48
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,938
- [Devon] What are you doing?

49
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:10,771
That didn't work at all!

50
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:11,870
- Man, I thought my hammer skills

51
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,703
were way better than that.

52
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:13,634
- That was terrible, okay.

53
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:14,467
- That one's a very-- - Put that away.

54
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:16,210
- Okay, we have some coco pods here,

55
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,423
oh, it is slimy! Oh!

56
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:22,374
Wow, I feel like Chewbacca right now,

57
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,207
it's like argh!

58
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:24,490
- That is really gross.

59
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,180
- Oh, my gosh, man! - Yup!

60
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,570
- It's raining dry ice.

61
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,180
I've sliced open a coco pod right here,

62
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,013
now it's time to fill it up

63
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:31,440
with a whole bunch of coco butter.

64
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,630
- [Both] Three, two, one, whoa!

65
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,004
- [Devon] Holy cow, it looks like liquid gold.

66
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:38,410
- [Collins] Oh my gosh, it's gonna

67
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,130
harden into Chewbacca's body.

68
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,287
- [Devon] I just gotta continue chiseling this.

69
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,487
- The thing is, Devon,

70
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:43,490
I think you're going about it all wrong.

71
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,323
We just take it right here.

72
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:47,110
Oh, no, how?

73
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,970
- I am the true king, I am King Arthur

74
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,240
with my little juice stick.

75
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,130
- Wait, you saw me trying to pull that out.

76
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,360
- Yeah, and it wasn't working, Devon.

77
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,468
You missed the whole (blowing lightly)

78
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:55,314
like that, you didn't get that done.

79
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:56,147
- Are you kidding me?

80
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:56,980
- Yes, this can be a little light saber for ya.

81
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,530
- Okay, well, thank you very much.

82
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,420
Gonna put this aside, then start making Yoda.

83
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,530
Gotta do this a couple more times,

84
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,662
and that'll be the base of my Chewbacca.

85
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:04,700
All right, this thing is attached and ready to go.

86
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,017
This is for my edible Play-Doh like stuff

87
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:07,187
that I'm making for his body.

88
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:08,865
- It's time to bust a coconut.

89
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:11,010
(smashing on table) (chuckling)

90
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,250
- More like bust a table.

91
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,083
- You can take it with a mallet like this,

92
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,023
here we go, oh, bam!

93
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:16,880
That's what you call in there.

94
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,640
It's smoking, it's literally smoking!

95
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,720
Now's the moment of truth, see if I

96
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,572
can crack open this very coconut with my bare hands.

97
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:24,405
(yelling)

98
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:25,238
Oh, I'm getting it, I'm getting it!

99
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:27,074
- [Devon] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

100
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:27,907
- Yes! - Yeah!

101
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:29,165
- Look at me, I'm going Wookiee mode, teah, man!

102
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:31,950
This is going to be perfect for Chewbacca.

103
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,180
- It stopped working, oh no it didn't.

104
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,302
All right, adding some flour into here,

105
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:36,310
and this is gonna be for the base

106
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,370
of my body of Yoda.

107
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,710
It's like kind of a Play-Doh.

108
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,543
- You're making one of the most

109
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:41,120
powerful Jedi's in the whole galaxy.

110
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,003
- Yeah. - Out of apple sauce.

111
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:43,450
Just seems a little like

112
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,387
he should be made out of something

113
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:45,267
a lot more powerful like--

114
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,810
- No, no, an apple a day keeps Darth Vader away.

115
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,660
- Ah, yes, yes.

116
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,650
I've gotta perfect ring of isomalt here,

117
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,740
and the goal is to turn this ring

118
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,943
into Chewbacca's iconic hair.

119
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:54,355
Just drop it in like this,

120
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:55,188
three, two, one, oh!

121
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,021
(both yelling)

122
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:57,700
I broke it! - You gotta start over.

123
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,930
- Yeah, I gotta start all over again.

124
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,573
Oh my gosh, this is gonna be tough.

125
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:01,600
- [Devon] Now it's time to start making

126
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,915
my Darth Vader watermelon.

127
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:03,748
- All right, here we go-- - All right, you got it.

128
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:04,581
- Got another one right here.

129
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:05,624
Lather this thing up,

130
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:06,457
and almost the core starts here,

131
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:07,332
and then we're gonna go for a pull.

132
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,390
This might be a whole new career for me

133
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,684
if I can pull this off. - If you can pull it off?

134
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:11,730
- Nice, Devon, we don't do puns here.

135
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,540
- Hey man, you made the pun, I just pointed it out.

136
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,116
- Now, before I reveal this watermelon sculpture

137
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:16,700
it's just gonna need a little bit more work.

138
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,480
So, stick right to find out how it turns out.

139
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,855
Here's the first big moment.

140
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:21,035
Time to take it like this, twist it.

141
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,270
Oh, yeah!

142
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,997
- Look at this, I'm coloring the dough for Yoda's head.

143
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,210
- Are you making Yoda, or Swamp Thing right there, Devon?

144
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,570
- [Devon] I'm making Yoda, dude, he's green.

145
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,350
- [Collins] It's all about quantity, about doing this

146
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,460
a whole bunch of times and looping it over, man.

147
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,330
- [Devon] Got this thing into a

148
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,848
nice shape for his head here.

149
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,950
- Yo, all right, the fibers all starting

150
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,783
to come together, man.

151
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:38,970
You can see it, look at this!

152
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,480
- Whoa! - Holy cow.

153
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,820
I can see why it takes years and years

154
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,653
of practice to get it right,

155
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:44,607
but it looks absolutely incredible.

156
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:45,820
- All right, Yoda's head is done,

157
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,830
now it's time to add the hair.

158
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,800
- All right, whilst you go that, Devon,

159
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,880
time to introduce the most powerful light saber

160
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,978
in all the galaxy right here.

161
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:53,089
Three, two, one!

162
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:53,922
- Okay, oh! - Wow!

163
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:56,773
That's not, wrong one, let me try like that?

164
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:59,261
That's not right either, let's hit it like this.

165
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:01,310
- Hold on. - Yeah.

166
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,420
- Oh! We had it for a second.

167
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,170
Well, it's not quite working right so let's just, all right.

168
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,003
We'll deactivate it.

169
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,410
- So, I got some rice noodles here, they're very dry.

170
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,812
Gonna stick these into the top of his head like this.

171
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:11,645
- [Collins] All right, whilst you work on your hair,

172
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:12,478
I'm gonna continue with my hair.

173
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:14,020
Looks like a little bug right now.

174
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,280
- I know, right? - He's got little antennas.

175
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,690
Gonna pour it in here like this.

176
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,760
All right, and then just kinda

177
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,593
crimp down like that.

178
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,120
I'm really trying to get some great locks like,

179
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,870
cause you can have this Chewbacca,

180
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,510
or you can have this Chewbacca.

181
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,910
You could have this Chewbacca, or this Chewbacca!

182
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,700
I want that Chewbacca.

183
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,590
Look at the little wiring, man,

184
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,423
like someone kinda got

185
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:30,620
like a static electricity shock on him.

186
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,800
What do these look like, Devon?

187
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,110
- They look like cacti.

188
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,689
- No, they are Chewbacca's legs.

189
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:35,670
- Oh!

190
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,420
- [Colin] Yeah, except right now they are very hairy,

191
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,360
so I have to de-hair Chewbacca's legs,

192
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,660
and get it real nice and deep into all those hairs.

193
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,330
- As you're doing that, this is

194
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,950
some hot oil for Yoda's hair.

195
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,330
- [Collins] You're making his hair outta oil?

196
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,163
- Yes!

197
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,390
- [Both] Three, two, one! Whoa!

198
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,160
- His hair! - Holy cow!

199
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,380
- It's turning crazy! - It's getting all wiry, dude!

200
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,660
- Yes! Yoda went from zero to hero real quick, man.

201
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,597
- [Devon] This is a pure Einstein Yoda.

202
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:02,230
- Got the wax on ya like this,

203
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,690
and now it's time to rip it all off.

204
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,770
I mean, very gently take it off of Chewbacca's legs.

205
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,490
- All right, that's it for his hair, now onto the body.

206
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,290
- The wax is all on, I've got a strip right here.

207
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,883
Gonna place it on just like this.

208
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:12,710
Now, it's kinda gotta squeeze it on.

209
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,880
Time to wax a cactus, here we go

210
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,688
- [Both] Three, two, one!

211
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:17,660
(yelling)

212
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,860
- Man! - Did it work?

213
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,060
- We waxed it, bro!

214
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,010
All right, got some dough here

215
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,050
to make Yoda's club.

216
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,470
- All right I gotta a hug chunk of bar

217
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,730
right here, and a heat blaster.

218
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,805
- I'm gonna put this sheet of plexi over the top.

219
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:28,390
This is gonna compress it

220
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,010
into a very, very thin layer of noodle.

221
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,060
- Time for me to take the body

222
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,681
and stick It here on Chewbacca's legs.

223
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:34,973
(yelling)

224
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:36,158
- Oh man, like butter! - Like butter.

225
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:37,430
- Smooth as butter!

226
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,670
Oh! Uh-oh! - This is tough,

227
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,960
this is real tough, this is real tough,

228
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,180
this is real tough, but I got it!

229
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,360
Now it's time to grab the pump.

230
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,730
- Why a pink pump, Devon?

231
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,740
- Cause that's what it came with.

232
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,050
You have a problem with a pink pump?

233
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,230
- I have no problem with a pink pump.

234
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,640
Now it's time to grab all the different elements,

235
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,810
put 'em together, and assemble them

236
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,300
into the final art sculpture.

237
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,737
The Star Wars art pieces are done

238
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:56,120
and I am mind blown by these--

239
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,680
- Yours looks amazing!

240
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,930
- Thank you I'm gonna level with you,

241
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,370
this took a ton of work, a lot of time,

242
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,157
and a whole bunch of help from a ton of my friends,

243
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:04,720
it looks incredible!

244
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,650
- And I'm not mad dude, that looks amazing.

245
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,000
- Yeah 'cause there's no way on my own

246
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,060
I'd be able to create this.

247
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,814
- [Both] Three, two, one, ta-da!

248
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:12,647
Whoa, what!

249
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:13,900
- [Devon] Now I know you're ready to see

250
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,530
this watermelon sculpture, but it's gonna

251
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,500
take a little bit more work.

252
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,320
- So we'll be revealing it at the end of the video.

253
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,269
Slime freeze!

254
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:20,584
(yelling)

255
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:21,850
Dude look at that man!

256
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,840
You challenged us to do the ultimate food art challenge

257
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,230
where we make watermelon sculptures,

258
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,371
Star Wars characters, and even edible

259
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:28,450
aliens and mummies so lets go.

260
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,770
- [Devon] Think of this as the edible

261
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,720
intestines of my edible mummy.

262
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,553
- [Collins] This is gonna make the

263
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:33,460
intestines for the innards of your mummy,

264
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,640
these eggs here are gonna be the innards of my alien.

265
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,756
Oh, that sounded like intestines right there Devon.

266
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:38,890
All right here we go just gonna keep cracking

267
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,895
these eggs in here like it's my job,

268
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:41,510
like it's my business.

269
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,780
- [Devon] Whoa, I filled up one on the inside!

270
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,360
- Holy cow! - It's like a lava lamp!

271
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,193
- [Collins] Three, two, one,

272
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:48,200
just gonna squeeze it down, oh!

273
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,050
Dude you're getting your things in my eggs, man!

274
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,810
- I'm sorry, it's hard to control!

275
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,300
- Supposed to be Area 51 over here,

276
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,510
I'm supposed to be keeping it all secret.

277
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,910
All right well here we go gonna blow up my balloon.

278
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,837
- This is my favorite intestines so far man!

279
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:01,310
(laughing) Nice, quite the prank.

280
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,970
- Call me the professional prankster.

281
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:03,970
Just gonna put it on here like this,

282
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,840
and again the balloon kinda acts as like the stomach.

283
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,040
You can probably see what's gonna happen next,

284
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,050
we're gonna try to get all of the eggs inside the balloon.

285
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,760
Here we go three, two, one, like this!

286
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,540
And then just squeeze it in.

287
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,774
- Look at that, is that necessary man?

288
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:17,380
(Collins yelling)

289
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,200
The way these intestines glisten in the light man,

290
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,033
makes me wanna eat 'em!

291
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,320
- I've never heard anyone say that before,

292
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,375
it doesn't sound that appetizing.

293
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,183
Three, two, one, oh!

294
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:27,731
(both yelling)

295
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:28,670
That's no, oh!

296
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,110
- Put it back, put it back, put it back!

297
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,560
What have I done? - I don't know,

298
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,910
but that was nasty.

299
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,059
Time to cook the egg balloon,

300
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:34,892
and this is gonna create the

301
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:35,912
perfect intestines for my aliens.

302
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:36,890
Just gonna drop the egg in, there we go,

303
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,620
and then put the boom, and then bam,

304
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,750
and then that's gonna cook.

305
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,583
- Boom in the bam!

306
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,610
- The boom in the bam and the cook!

307
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,400
That's a pretty intense bucket of intestines

308
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,100
you got right there, Devon. - Oh it is.

309
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,933
- All right well I'm just gonna

310
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:46,766
let this keep cooking and now

311
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,641
it's onto the next part of my alien.

312
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:48,891
All right I think my balloon boiled egg

313
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:51,320
is all done, can you relax bro!

314
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,870
For one second all right, so here we go,

315
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,743
just pull this out like this.

316
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:55,805
- Oh, that's funky looking. - Whoa wait a second.

317
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:57,021
- I have to feel that, whoa!

318
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:59,440
- Yeah it's bizarre! - It's like rubbery.

319
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,050
- This right here is gonna be a massive egg.

320
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,170
We don't have any more ostrich eggs,

321
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,740
so this is kind of our new DIY version of an ostrich egg.

322
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,730
- [Devon] I'm making lemon curds

323
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,800
for the stomach of my mummy,

324
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,740
and you can't have lemon curd without lemons!

325
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,600
- This is true, Devon speaks the truth!

326
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,290
All right here we go, three, two, one,

327
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,310
let's remove the balloon!

328
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,540
- Oh, what on earth? - Oh, there we go!

329
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,630
- It looks like a balloon-shaped sweet potato!

330
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,120
- Its a giant egg Devon! - Oh it is?

331
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,130
- All right so now the final thing

332
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,310
I gotta do with my egg here we go.

333
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,270
Get a bowl, I gotta harvest it and break it down.

334
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,460
This little fun life hack I learned

335
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,100
so here we go, gotta grab some lemons.

336
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,330
This thing is I don't actually need the lemons,

337
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,163
I need this net right here.

338
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:30,680
All right so here we go, the idea is

339
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,810
I'm actually gonna be able to squeeze

340
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,530
out these things in between these little holes.

341
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,010
Three, two, one, here we go like this,

342
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,640
and just push the egg through it.

343
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,473
- [Devon] What is this?

344
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:39,800
- [Collins] These are gonna be the intestines, Devon.

345
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,450
He's got a whole bunch of little tiny short intestines.

346
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,900
- [Devon] Look at that, look at that!

347
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,040
- Not as satisfying as I hoped it would be,

348
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,370
oh look at that, oh!

349
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,580
All right happy thoughts, lemon thoughts!

350
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,248
- Jeez dude! - (coughing) it smells so bad!

351
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:52,300
- I can't even look at that thing!

352
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,034
- Here we go, squeeze it like that!

353
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,867
(retching)

354
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,160
All right well now we're onto the next part of the alien.

355
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,050
- Yeah I gotta make a lot more lemon juice.

356
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,731
- Yeah and hopefully it'll overpower the egg man.

357
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:02,240
Get some tapioca right here

358
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,610
and this stuff is gonna be real weird

359
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,680
on the inside of the alien.

360
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,020
Time to get it out, oh man this is,

361
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,020
hold on this is very stuck.

362
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,160
There we go okay it's starting to come down a little bit.

363
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,370
- [Devon] Well I got some butter here

364
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,549
and now it's time to melt it down for my lemon curd.

365
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,815
- [Both] Okay!

366
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:16,648
- Oh man well here we go--

367
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:17,640
- I didn't know I needed flour in mine

368
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,690
but now I know I do!

369
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,580
- Exactly, so we're gonna have

370
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,750
to give it the once around.

371
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,108
- Oh no, oh no, oh no. - gonna go like this.

372
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:23,150
This is the once around cause technically--

373
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,780
- That was five around bro,

374
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,060
that was like five or six around!

375
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,893
- [Both] Where did it go?

376
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:28,160
- Oh my gosh it went on the--

377
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,993
- What no way, oh!

378
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:31,058
Then we're gonna add in some more of this powder here.

379
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:32,386
So yeet so here we go, just going to,

380
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:33,740
here we go place it down like this.

381
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,190
And then we're just gonna place the tapioca in--

382
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,060
- Got it!

383
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,470
- Turn this into worms that'll be

384
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,890
on the inside of my alien.

385
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,930
- Are you kidding? - Enjoying life.

386
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,020
No I'm not Devon. - That's nasty.

387
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,525
- He's an alien Devon, there's microorganisms

388
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:44,650
that are living inside of him, like worms.

389
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,170
Wait you're just gonna melt down the butter in there?

390
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,003
- [Devon] Yes I am!

391
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,990
- It's getting a very slow process

392
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,930
to be able to do it man.

393
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,210
- It's actually cleaner and faster

394
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,080
than doing it in a pan, Collins!

395
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,124
- Sorry! - What was that,

396
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:54,513
are you kidding me! - That was my greatest slam--

397
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:56,739
- This is my, this merch is black!

398
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,309
What are you doing!

399
00:09:58,309 --> 00:09:59,960
- All right time for me to create the tapioca worms.

400
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,080
Got piece number one right here,

401
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,335
gonna slam it down in here.

402
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,100
Slam in!

403
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,166
Okay there we go, there we go, little noodles!

404
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,387
- Noodles! - Noodles!

405
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:08,864
Man this is so much more difficult than I expected.

406
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:10,033
Okay here we go it's good.

407
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,003
(grunting)

408
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,200
This is so tough dude.

409
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,033
- I know, I've been through it.

410
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:14,610
All right got that stick of butter,

411
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,838
now I gotta move onto my next one.

412
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:16,890
Okay then.

413
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,090
- Three, two, one, argh!

414
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:23,160
Bam there we go, tapioca noodles!

415
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,530
Or, Devon's new wig.

416
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,640
All right well here are the worms

417
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,110
for the inside of my alien

418
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,680
and now it's onto the next part of the body.

419
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,170
I've got some very hot isomalt here

420
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,161
because it is time to make the arms and legs of my alien!

421
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:34,550
What is that? - Good sir!

422
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,600
This is my lemon curd!

423
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,433
- [Collins] Wait so you're mixing

424
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:38,510
eggs with lemons over here?

425
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,830
- Yes. - Gonna pour my isomalt

426
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,847
in here like this, make sure it's set down, here we go.

427
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:43,551
- [Devon] All right just need to add this here

428
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,590
into this pan and then heat it up,

429
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,010
and then I'll be onto my next step.

430
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,230
Dude these lemon curds are gonna add

431
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,370
a whole 'nother flavor to my mummy stomach!

432
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,432
- [Collins] It's looking good so here we go,

433
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:52,517
just gonna add olive oil in like this.

434
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:55,129
Look at that dude, look at that!

435
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:55,962
- [Devon] Nicely done!

436
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:57,390
- Okay, it's coming together man!

437
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,490
I gotta say the olive oil's not

438
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,540
going in fast enough though,

439
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,373
it's gotta a little bit quicker.

440
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:01,764
Come on, come on, it's like collapsing,

441
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:02,597
it's collapsing no!

442
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:03,743
It's like dripping to the side,

443
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:05,370
it's like a Leaning Tower of Pisa right now!

444
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,203
Oh my gosh!

445
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:07,490
So what we're making alien arms,

446
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,050
so technically anything goes right now.

447
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,027
- That's the alien's arm?

448
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:11,580
- Yup, yup, that's the aliens arm.

449
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,700
Support it, support would be great.

450
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,726
I am out of oil!

451
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:14,680
- [Devon] It looks like it's about to pop man!

452
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,690
- I am out of oil man!

453
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,837
If you could hold this up here once I get this,

454
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:17,864
the rest of it should--

455
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:19,160
(screaming)

456
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,300
- It weirdly looks like an elephant trunk.

457
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,648
I did not realize that these intestines

458
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,017
would not mix very well with the lemon curd.

459
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,100
I'm gonna mix this up.

460
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,190
- Dry ice in there? - Yes!

461
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,023
All right here we go.

462
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:29,280
- [Both] Three, two--

463
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,113
- Wait wait three second challenge!

464
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:31,210
We wanna see if you can like this video

465
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,120
in three seconds, you ready? Here we go!

466
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,840
- [Both] Three, two, one, done!

467
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,190
Three, two, one!

468
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,164
- [Collins] Let's see, oh!

469
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:40,780
Mix it up, mix it up! - Then I gotta mix it up.

470
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,890
- This oil, all this oil's getting out of control!

471
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,756
Too much, too much, okay that should be fine.

472
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:46,530
(screaming)

473
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,340
What, what! - I am not cleaning that up.

474
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,300
Could you imagine if you had dug up--

475
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,450
- What, I'm dealing with loss.

476
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,020
- This looks like the innards of something

477
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,730
that's been dead for a very long time.

478
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,970
- Well I'm gonna have to clean up

479
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,010
all this oil right now 'cause otherwise

480
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,640
we're gonna be slipping and sliding everything.

481
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,900
- [Devon] Mission accomplished with mine.

482
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,930
- [Collins] It must've ate something really bad

483
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,274
before it passed away man.

484
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:04,160
- All right get this giant bingo tumbler here

485
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,254
all set up, because I am making

486
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:06,880
the core of his brain!

487
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,810
- I thought I had the coolest looking

488
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,100
cylindrical thing here man!

489
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,310
- Definitely not anymore!

490
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,040
- Well excuse me my jackfruit needs a smidge of room,

491
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,090
so could I just have you move yours over--

492
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:13,923
- They really don't want you

493
00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:15,103
getting into this bingo thing.

494
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:15,936
- Yeah I just want you to move it over this way.

495
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,310
Wait a minute, it turns! - Yes!

496
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,270
- While you do that we're gonna make

497
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,372
the skin of my alien.

498
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,560
I wanted it to have a very unique looking texture to it.

499
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,897
So we got some agar-agar over here,

500
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm just gonna pour it here on the jackfruit

501
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,340
and hopefully gonna get a nice

502
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,950
ridge-looking approach so here we go.

503
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,700
- I've never tried to get out so much

504
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,460
peanut butter in my life at one time.

505
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,840
- Next up I need to spread the skin!

506
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,670
Spread, spread. - Spread spread.

507
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,503
- [Collins] Spread spread!

508
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:38,180
- Now I gotta add in some of this granola right here.

509
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,384
- The way you said granola.

510
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,217
- Granola! - Gra-no-la!

511
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,702
- Close it up here just like this.

512
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:45,950
And now, mixy mixy!

513
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,783
All right--

514
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,006
- Yo man, what is shooting out?

515
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:49,977
Did I not mention the holes?

516
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,775
- You did mention them. - I mentioned the holes!

517
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:53,700
I know when a mess is about to be made,

518
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,850
it's like a spidey sense I have

519
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,860
it just goes off and I'm like

520
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,693
yup, a mess is about to happen.

521
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,430
- You have a spidey sense for when

522
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,460
a mess is about to be made?

523
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,310
- [Collins] Well I'm just gonna keep packing

524
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,520
the skin on, gonna let it dry,

525
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,353
and then peek it off.

526
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:04,169
- [Devon] Look at that, it's like seeping through!

527
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,650
- [Collins] Yeah, centripetal force bro!

528
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,600
- Like trying to make some noodles there!

529
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,393
What did I do wrong? - Everything, it has holes.

530
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:11,135
All right here we go, time to peel off my alien skin.

531
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:13,320
Oh my gosh-- - yes, it is actually

532
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,570
kinda coming together! - Watch the faucet!

533
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,733
This is so satisfying man, look at this!

534
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:20,530
- Whoa! - Holy cow!

535
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,905
And boom, all right!

536
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:23,990
This is going to be the skin of my alien.

537
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,920
- I've got to say this brain is gonna be really tasty.

538
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,360
- Only a few things left for my alien.

539
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,730
Just the rib cage, some eye balls,

540
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,640
and a couple different things

541
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,750
and mine will be fully done.

542
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,583
- Mines almost done as well,

543
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,640
just gotta put 'em together!

544
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,930
- We got the edible alien and mummy

545
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,300
and these things turned out so good man!

546
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,270
Like I gotta this might be the best

547
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,610
art I have ever done!

548
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,910
- I think so, it's either that

549
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,430
or the Pennywise bro. - Oh yeah!

550
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,640
The thing is for this one I did have to get

551
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,810
some friends to help me out with this

552
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,850
but it took a lot of time

553
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,400
and I'm really proud of how it turned out!

554
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,620
- Yeah and I actually also

555
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,930
had to use some friends help because

556
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,500
this one was really difficult.

557
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,410
- The thing I'm the most excited about

558
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,300
is opening these up, dissecting them,

559
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,260
and then eating whatever's on the inside.

560
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,520
Woo it's gonna be interesting!

561
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,353
Here we go!

562
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:00,650
- [Both] Three, two, one, ta-da!

563
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,780
- Look at these masterpieces! - Yes! I have to say,

564
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,613
I'm a little creeped out.

565
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,420
- [Collins] And like the eye in there too and everything!

566
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,750
We've got the edible alien and mummy

567
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,764
and now it is time to dissect them

568
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,260
and see how they taste!

569
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,500
We're gonna eat Devon's mummy first.

570
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,190
- There are four part of it that I am really excited to eat.

571
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,330
- All right Devon so what's the first one,

572
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,689
what are we gonna be tasting first?

573
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,522
- First part is going to be the arms.

574
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:18,930
So I'm just gonna break off one of these--

575
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,394
- [Both] Three, two, one, oh!

576
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:24,483
- Oh ow, ow, I forgot what we put in here man!

577
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:26,420
- [Collins] What is that, looks like maggots dude!

578
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,340
- I know right? - Holy cow!

579
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,720
- [Devon] Isn't that nasty?

580
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,300
- I gotta say I think I'm just going to,

581
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,054
gonna leave this one to you bro, you got this.

582
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:32,893
- What do you mean? - You got this bro!

583
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:34,170
- This looks so cool!

584
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,003
- You got this, I believe in you!

585
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:36,306
- It's supposed to be kinda gross!

586
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:37,139
- [Collins] Enjoy the taste!

587
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,110
- Well I guess we're gonna move on to Collins'.

588
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,733
- Hey well in that case I will come back.

589
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:42,007
- That's one arm, do you wanna do the next arm?

590
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,000
- Yes, I thought it was gonna be a little bit firmer

591
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,947
cause of how it all looks but like oh man,

592
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:45,780
it's a little squishy.

593
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,600
It literally looks like maggots,

594
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,510
did you actually put maggots in here?

595
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,040
- No I didn't bro, all right.

596
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,760
Let's just get to the chest now, you ready?

597
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,840
- Sure. - I'm just gonna go

598
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,170
for a bite of the arm? - Okay you ready?

599
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,545
- They're both the same, you ready?

600
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:56,378
- All right here we go.

601
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:58,173
- [Both] Three, two, one!

602
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,530
- It's very bready.

603
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,560
All right now that that's done,

604
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,160
it's time to open up the chest.

605
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,993
- Yeah I'm a little bit concerned

606
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:05,790
cause you've been really building this up,

607
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,120
there's a knife involved! - There is, and some pincers.

608
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,130
- Am I expecting something to like burst out of the chest?

609
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,620
- You're expecting a lot of things, Collins,

610
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,453
I don't know which one.

611
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,286
All right here we go.

612
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:15,443
- [Both] Three, two, one, argh!

613
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,280
- You slice it open? - Yup!

614
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,113
- [Collins] What's going on the inside man?

615
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:20,116
- [Devon] Look, it's the little intestines dude!

616
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:21,616
(both yelling)

617
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:23,620
- [Both] Ohhh, yeah!

618
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,530
- That's-- - that's awesome!

619
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,670
This one, it's probably gonna taste

620
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,930
better than the arms, but it looks

621
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,210
like it's gonna taste far worse.

622
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,953
- All right time to see how these things taste, you ready?

623
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:33,963
- [Both] Here we go, three, two, one!

624
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,610
- Whoa! - My lemon curd bro!

625
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,591
- That is delicious, yeah!

626
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:41,390
(talking with food in mouth)

627
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,300
- Let's get to the legs.

628
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,170
- [Both] Three, two, one, yup!

629
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,870
- Oh yup, it is definitely hard.

630
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,073
Gotta peel back this bit, whoa!

631
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,540
They're hollow! - What?

632
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,948
- Yeah! - What are those?

633
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:56,150
- Look, first of all his legs are baguette legs,

634
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,983
I know you'd love that.

635
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:59,060
And look, they're stuck in the legs!

636
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,390
I put little bugs in there

637
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,884
but they kind merged together into one massive bug.

638
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:04,210
- That's even grosser!

639
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,767
- [Both] Here we go, three, two, one!

640
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:08,770
(grunting)

641
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,258
- Wow, holy cow. - It's the best.

642
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:11,391
(coughing)

643
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,224
- The bread!

644
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:13,550
- Well now it's time to go for the main event,

645
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,383
the mummy's head!

646
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:16,240
- And I'm guessing stuff's gonna ooze?

647
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,790
- You're guessing may be correct!

648
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,623
All right here we go.

649
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:20,510
- [Both] Three, two, one!

650
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,424
- [Devon] Go for the slice.

651
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:23,997
(both yelling)

652
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:25,130
Okay, just a membrane thing.

653
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,220
So then give me the brain underneath this I guess.

654
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,250
- [Both] Three, two, one.

655
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,083
- [Devon] Let's see it!

656
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,400
(both yelling)

657
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,300
- Yes, wow!

658
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,550
- doesn't that brain look amazing?

659
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,494
- I'm impressed! - And now, it's time to just--

660
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,327
(retching) - oh, whoa!

661
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,820
That's that peanut butter stuff that I used, remember?

662
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,223
- Oh, so that's gonna be delicious then!

663
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:41,222
- Yes, it's gonna be great!

664
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:42,055
All right here we go.

665
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:44,143
- [Both] Three, two, one!

666
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,670
(both yelling)

667
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,190
- One of the best things we've done!

668
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,990
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah!

669
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,130
- That was amazing! - So good!

670
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,360
- [Collins] Devon the first part of my alien,

671
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,760
what do you think we're gonna start with here man?

672
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,990
- [Devon] I don't know man, it's up to you!

673
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,060
- Here's the thing, I really wanna start things off

674
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,100
with a bang so we're gonna go for the head first.

675
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,933
Here we go, here we go.

676
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,580
- [Both] Three, two, one!

677
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,730
- [Collins] Just like this, here we go!

678
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,104
(both yelling)

679
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:08,980
- That looks tough! - Yo, look at the inside

680
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,780
of the head! - No way, I have to eat that?

681
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,789
- It's kind of a little pocket!

682
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:13,203
That's pretty funky looking.

683
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:15,080
- I think I'm gonna grab some of the eye,

684
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,040
and then probably some of this outer membrane stuff.

685
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,610
- All right you know what, put on my little sock.

686
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,443
All right here we go.

687
00:17:19,443 --> 00:17:21,477
- [Both] Three, two, one!

688
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:24,980
- Whoa, oh! (retching)

689
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,877
It tastes like tar! - Yeah it's really bad!

690
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,710
- I know it sounds kind of counterintuitive,

691
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,360
but maybe the feet will taste better than the head.

692
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,820
We're gonna grab off one of the toes like this,

693
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,520
here we go-- - Oh, that is--

694
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,980
- [Collins] That is a stretchy toe!

695
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,813
- Let me do it.

696
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:36,646
- Okay, you wanna give it a shot?

697
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:37,832
- [Devon] Here we go, three, two, one!

698
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,324
(yelling)

699
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,240
- How'd you get that so easily?

700
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,073
All right here we go.

701
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:43,056
- [Both] Three, two, one!

702
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,551
(cheering)

703
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:47,050
- That is really good!

704
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,090
- That's redemption right there!

705
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,140
The big wow factor in my alien, the stomach right here!

706
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,540
Just wait 'till you see what happens

707
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,814
when we slice this thing open.

708
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:55,010
- I can't wait! - all right here we go.

709
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,215
- [Both] Three, two, one!

710
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:58,780
(both screaming)

711
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,950
- Dude it's like an alien inside an alien!

712
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,910
What is going on!

713
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,040
I put a water balloon and that's

714
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,873
way bigger than I expected man!

715
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,630
- You made this dude, what are you doing?

716
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,463
- I'm doing my best here we go.

717
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:08,464
- [Both] Three, two, one!

718
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:11,047
(both yelling)

719
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:14,310
- Whoa! - Look at that!

720
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,023
That's a lot, oh, look at that!

721
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:21,590
- [Both] Three, two, one!

722
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,753
(yelling)

723
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:26,434
- That's so bad!

724
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:29,810
(talking with mouth full)

725
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,890
- Now it's finally time

726
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,470
to reveal my Darth Vader watermelon!

727
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,150
- And I am truly blown away by this masterpiece,

728
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,210
it doesn't even make sense how you did this!

729
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,060
So here we go.

730
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,363
- [Both] Three, two, one!

731
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:41,748
(both yelling)

732
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:43,390
- Look at that bro, that is unbelievable!

733
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,970
We got the edible Star Wars art,

734
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,700
and now it's time to see how they taste.

735
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,940
Both of these are amazing,

736
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,320
some of the best stuff we've ever done.

737
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,410
- [Devon] I completely agree with you.

738
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,950
- So Devon the question becomes,

739
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,300
which one do we want to eat first?

740
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,430
Do we wanna sink our teeth into a solid Yoda?

741
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,760
Or into a fuzzy Wookiee?

742
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,780
- It's all on Yoda - Let's eat some of the feet.

743
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,512
I'm gonna take a full ear, what,

744
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:01,350
yeah look at that!

745
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,032
- Let's see if we can crack this like this.

746
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:03,865
(yelling)

747
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:04,700
There we go, all right cool,

748
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,533
we got some pieces of the ear.

749
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:07,020
I want a finger, can I grab his thumb?

750
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,853
- [Devon] Yeah go for it man.

751
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:08,830
- [Collins] I think this Yoda's thumb,

752
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,278
with the finger nail and everything.

753
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:11,111
- [Devon] I think I'm gonna take off

754
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:11,944
one of his feet right here.

755
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,904
- One of his toes-- - oh yeah, there you go!

756
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,597
- Look at that on the inside, that's a whole bunch

757
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:17,017
of flavor packed into some toes.

758
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:18,270
- All right here we go.

759
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,238
- [Both] Three, two, one!

760
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:22,936
- Oh, wow, whoa, whoa!

761
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:26,993
- [Both] Whoa, whoa, yeah!

762
00:19:27,887 --> 00:19:28,910
- I think I nailed it on this one!

763
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,300
- Oh my gosh! - It is really hard though.

764
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,372
You might chip a tooth.

765
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,560
- [Both] So good!

766
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,814
- You're mouth is green, like the Hulk!

767
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:37,311
(grunting)

768
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:38,144
(talking with mouth full)

769
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,350
- Now it's time to try Chewbacca.

770
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,530
And I gotta say with Chewbacca,

771
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,840
if you don't like hair in your food

772
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,110
you probably won't like Chewbacca--

773
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,070
- He's not the one for you.

774
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,240
- We're gonna go for two different parts.

775
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,217
I think one part I wanna try is the head,

776
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,150
I also wanna try an arm of him,

777
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,983
so which one do you want Devon,

778
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:49,980
do you want the head or the arm?

779
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,068
- I'll take the arm! - Here we go.

780
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:52,750
(both yelling)

781
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,100
There we go, all right.

782
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,490
I gotta say it's looking like it

783
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,803
lost a bit of it's shape.

784
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,890
Yeah it's very, very hairy.

785
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,810
Let me try and grab his head.

786
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,440
So sorry Chewbacca, you look so nice,

787
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,273
you look so lovely.

788
00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:04,106
All right well there we go--

789
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:06,020
- His beard came off! - Exactly, he is now

790
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,400
a cleanly shaven Chewbacca, he looks like Devon!

791
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,860
- No he doesn't. - Yeah with the hair I mean,

792
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,930
the hair styles kind of the same

793
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,846
as Devon's hair style man!

794
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,730
- Oh, I beg to differ!

795
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,510
- I mean Devon if you had hair all over your body,

796
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,530
you would be a Chewbacca!?

797
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,270
- Okay, I think let's move on from this topic.

798
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,230
- All right well it's time to take a bite

799
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,440
and see how Chewbacca tastes man, you ready?

800
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,370
- Yeah let's do it. - All we're gonna go for it.

801
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,620
- [Both] Three, two--

802
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,280
- Oh wait if you wanna win a 15 minute

803
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,420
video call with Devon and I,

804
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,540
text the word PET to 81800 right now!

805
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,880
So pause the video, text the word PET to 81800

806
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,044
you'll automatically be entered in to win.

807
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:35,160
- [Both] Three, two, one!

808
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,690
- Oh, oh, oh!

809
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,113
It was smoking for a second!

810
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,510
Look at this head! - Holy cow!

811
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,660
- He's gone bald!

812
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,160
- My new favorite thing is life is bald Chewbacca,

813
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,810
I think this is absolutely hilarious.

814
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,960
You get to comment down below

815
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,330
who is your favorite movie character

816
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,330
you would love to see us make

817
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,750
an actually art sculpture out of.

818
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,550
- [Both] Oh, and and Happy New Year!
