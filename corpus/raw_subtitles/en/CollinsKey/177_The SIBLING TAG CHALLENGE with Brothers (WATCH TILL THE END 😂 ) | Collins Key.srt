1
00:00:00,774 --> 00:00:02,359
(laughter)

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:03,192
- Did you just hit record?

3
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,692
- [Camera man] Yup

4
00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:06,717
- Oh yeah.

5
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:07,610
- [Camera man] Go for it.

6
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,861
- Oh boy, okay.

7
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:09,694
No start over.

8
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:10,527
- [Camera man] No, go for it.

9
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:11,360
- No, no.

10
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,213
- [Camera man] Why are you doing this?

11
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:14,225
- Because it was an awkward beginning, okay fine.

12
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:15,086
What's up.

13
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:16,115
(laughter)

14
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:16,948
Shoot.

15
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:19,198
(laughter)

16
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:23,109
- This is so bad, I haven't even started the video.

17
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,942
No.

18
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:24,858
- What's up guys.

19
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,691
- I have to make you appear.

20
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:27,740
- So he has this giveaway that he wants to tell you about.

21
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,846
- No, go away.

22
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:29,679
Alright.

23
00:00:30,854 --> 00:00:32,854
Compose myself, alright.

24
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:37,155
I can't even start the video.

25
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,133
Oh, I thought you were smiling, okay.

26
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:44,104
What's up, it's Collins Key, welcome to the Thursday,

27
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:47,324
this is totally, uh, see, okay, let me try this again.

28
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:49,965
Take one, we're gonna shut all that down.

29
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:53,024
We're back to the beginning.

30
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:55,274
(laughter)

31
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:06,174
I can't do it,

32
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:10,124
I can't start the video.

33
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:15,020
I'm crying too, fun fact, I cry when I laugh,

34
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,381
it's a thing that happens all the time.

35
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:17,214
Alright.

36
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:22,496
What's up, it's Collins Key and welcome to the Thursday

37
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:24,555
vlog, unfortunately this video, as you guys can tell

38
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:26,975
by the fact that none of that was edited at all,

39
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:29,039
and there's no music in this video.

40
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,652
Things are different today, so to help me explain

41
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:33,425
what's going on, my little brother, Devan Key.

42
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:36,008
(finger snaps)

43
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:38,443
Three,

44
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:39,451
two,

45
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,284
one.

46
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:41,117
- [Together] Hey!

47
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:42,176
- What's up bro?

48
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:43,009
- How are you?

49
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:43,842
- It's good to see you.

50
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:44,675
- Yeah, it's good to see you too man.

51
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:45,600
- It's been soo long.

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,062
- It's been I think a full like three weeks since

53
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:48,931
we've filmed, that's the only time we see each other.

54
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,628
- Oh yeah, well, they just.

55
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:51,642
- #jokers

56
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,249
(laughter)

57
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:54,275
Oh no.

58
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:55,799
- These are all the jokes that get cut.

59
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,885
- Yeah, this is all the stuff that

60
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:57,932
gets cut out of the videos.

61
00:01:57,932 --> 00:02:00,879
So for today's video, I think I need a tissue.

62
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,712
- Want me to get you one?

63
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:02,545
- Yeah, if you could.

64
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:03,378
- Be right back.

65
00:02:03,378 --> 00:02:04,475
- So for today's video we are doing the

66
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:05,308
what's it called?

67
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:06,141
- [Devan] Tissue.

68
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:06,974
(laughter)

69
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:07,958
- What's the video called?

70
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:08,791
- [Devan] It's called the

71
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,103
- [Together] Stripped down challenge.

72
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:11,920
- So today we are doing the stripped down challenge.

73
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,148
So basically for this video,

74
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:14,654
I'm not allowed to edit this video,

75
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:16,451
I'm not allowed to add music to this video,

76
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:18,948
no graphics, nothing, just Devan and I talking with you

77
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:23,348
for 10 minutes, we have my phone right here which will

78
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:25,284
act as the stopwatch.

79
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:27,093
(laughter)

80
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:27,926
- Great.

81
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:28,759
- This is so crazy.

82
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,592
- This is so good.

83
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:31,724
- Okay, yes, so I'm going to start the timer right now.

84
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:32,895
Boom, I don't know if you can see that but there's

85
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,469
now 10 minutes on the clock.

86
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:35,495
- Get to work.

87
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:37,080
- Is it really 10, yes it's 10 minutes.

88
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,527
Oh yeah, one quick thing I did want to let you guys know.

89
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:42,128
- You're doing this in the 10 minutes?

90
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,702
- Yes. Okay fine, I'll start it over, okay fine,

91
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:44,557
we'll stop it really quick.

92
00:02:44,557 --> 00:02:45,959
I just wanted to let you guys know, as always,

93
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,060
I'm stopping the 10 minutes, this part doesn't count.

94
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,097
I'm doing a giveaway on my channel,

95
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:50,977
I'm giving away a Macbook, so if you guys want to win that,

- Where are those graphics at though?

100
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,501
- I don't know though.

101
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,814
And, uh, you have to be subscribed to this channel,

102
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:01,653
that being said, now let's get into it for reals.

103
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:03,075
Alright, here we go, bam, there we go,

104
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:05,443
10 minutes on the clock, bam, high energy,

105
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:07,394
we're getting this on, even though there's no cutting

106
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:08,450
or no editing, we're keeping that energy up there.

107
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,411
Oh, oh, oh.

108
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:12,319
(laughter)

109
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,152
- Like an ape?

110
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,830
(mimicking ape noise)

111
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,555
- Oh my goodness, see this is all the stuff

112
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:17,805
that's normally cut out of the video.

113
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:18,638
- Yeah.

114
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:19,471
- Okay.

115
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:20,304
- Alright.

116
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:23,303
(laughter)

117
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,611
- I don't know what to say.

118
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:27,966
(laughter)

119
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,313
I think this may just be 10 minutes of us

120
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:31,396
just laughing a lot.

121
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:33,052
- Alright, what do we start with?

122
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:34,353
- What do we start with?

123
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:36,629
- I say we start with, let's, what?

124
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:37,462
(laughter)

125
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:38,713
What did you say?

126
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:40,097
- I said what should we say.

127
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:41,214
- What should we say?

128
00:03:41,214 --> 00:03:42,047
- Yeah.

129
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,197
- Let's start off with something informative.

130
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:44,335
- Okay.

131
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:45,278
(laughter)

132
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:46,111
- I don't know what to do.

133
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:49,015
Let's start off with, at some point we will jump into

134
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:49,848
our insecurities.

135
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:50,804
- Collins cries when he laughs.

136
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:51,696
- Yeah, we will jump into our.

137
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:52,529
- That's informative.

138
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:53,362
- Can you let me.

139
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:55,030
Okay, yeah that is informative.

140
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,859
I think we'll save insecurities for like the last

141
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,525
little bit of this whole thing.

142
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,069
- Alright cool.

143
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:02,060
- That parts going to get real and right now

144
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,173
we're just not in the place to get real right now.

145
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:05,677
So we'll start it off with.

146
00:04:05,677 --> 00:04:06,765
- That'd be a hard reversal.

147
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,878
(laughter)

148
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:09,711
Sorry.

149
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,425
- Let me explain to you really quick what that was.

150
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:17,645
We've been in acting class for a year now,

151
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:19,678
and one term they use in acting class is reversal.

152
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:20,909
(laughter)

153
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:23,484
(fingers snap)

154
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:24,697
I don't know if we did it at the same time.

155
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,979
- I crack myself up.

156
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,045
(laughter)

157
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,429
I crack my elf up.

158
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:30,576
- I need another, do you have another tissue.

159
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:31,437
- I wish I had an elf.

160
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,387
- Thank you.

161
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:33,326
- That would be amazing.

162
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:34,159
- An elf?

163
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,992
- Yeah.

164
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:36,096
- Okay, we got to focus on this video though,

165
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:37,681
because we're just laughing the whole time.

166
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:39,327
And my eyes are watery, and my eyes get red too

167
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,546
when they water, which is not fun.

168
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,836
- You've burned like five minutes already.

169
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:42,669
- Okay.

170
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:43,502
- Okay.

171
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:47,010
- What do you want to talk about?

172
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,633
- We were going to do something informative?

173
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:49,903
- Yes.

174
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:52,130
- Tell them one thing about yourself

175
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,161
that they probably don't know.

176
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,152
That face was great.

177
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:56,985
- You go first.

178
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:57,818
- Me first?

179
00:04:57,818 --> 00:04:58,651
- I need to think about it.

180
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:01,606
- Something about me you probably don't know.

181
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:02,541
I don't know whether to say this.

182
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,902
If you guys remember that video where I

183
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,802
spray tanned my feet.

184
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:07,397
- Oh yeah, I did that.

185
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:09,647
(laughter)

186
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:21,842
I don't even do that in normal videos.

187
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:24,606
(laughter)

188
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,556
- My face is going to be so red.

189
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:27,999
- I don't know why I did that.

190
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,229
- I did that.

191
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,534
(laughter)

192
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:33,403
- Fun fact I swear to cut the laughter.

193
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:34,236
- Oh my God.

194
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,293
- I cry when I laugh.

195
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,010
- I need another tissue, I need another tissue.

196
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,343
I need another tissue, okay.

197
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:41,854
I just handled the tissue.

198
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:42,687
I was like.

199
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:43,520
(blows nose)

200
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,770
(laughter)

201
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,875
Okay, my eyes are going to be so red,

202
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,334
and my face is going to be so red, so when I spray tanned,

203
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:58,390
when he spray tanned my feet,

204
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,219
my toe nails were not protected,

205
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:03,286
and so half of my toenail is still yellow from it,

206
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:04,871
because as my toe nails are growing out

207
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,346
is the only way it's coming off.

208
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:07,269
So I don't know how to describe this,

209
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,238
but still half of my toe nails are yellow,

210
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:11,107
and it's slowly growing out, so it makes it look like

211
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,897
nasty looking toenails.

212
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:15,147
(laughter)

213
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:19,105
I don't even know how we're going to get serious bro.

214
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:21,328
This was a serious video.

215
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:23,697
(laughter)

216
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:26,367
- That was you like trying to tell people you don't

217
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:27,618
have messed up toes.

218
00:06:27,618 --> 00:06:29,868
(laughter)

219
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:33,551
He's like guys, just so you know,

220
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:35,136
my toes are not messed up.

221
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:37,286
- I need another tissue, I need another tissue.

222
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:38,310
It's your turn, go for it.

223
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,477
- Okay, well, sticking on

224
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:43,243
the video thing,

225
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:45,661
I would say like half of the stuff I did in like the

226
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:48,972
previous ones, Collins was the one who was like,

227
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:50,749
"bro, you should do this."

228
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:51,786
- Oh yeah, that is a good disclaimer.

229
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,748
- So there's like one that,

230
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,865
where I was like the destroyer of all worlds or something.

231
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:57,698
- Yeah.

232
00:06:57,698 --> 00:07:00,026
- You want to recreate the shot right now?

233
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:01,479
- No I don't.

234
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:03,442
- And he would like, what did he do?

235
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:06,439
Oh yeah, he said, "you should run through the lawn and

236
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,036
go like oh."

237
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:10,304
- We got the clip.

238
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,602
- We could loop that, no but there's no editing.

239
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:12,435
- There's no editing.

240
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:13,268
- Shoot I would have looped that.

241
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:14,101
- Yeah.

242
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:14,934
- Continue.

243
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,767
- This video is working to my advantage.

244
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,327
- Yes it is, okay.

245
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:18,494
- That was it.

246
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:23,477
- Hey guys, I did that, I made him do that.

247
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,082
- Yeah, that's one thing.

248
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:26,239
(laughter)

249
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,487
That is one thing that has happened in real life.

250
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:31,270
- Yeah, a lot of the stuff until recently has been.

251
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,142
- Let's tell them some fun stuff that

252
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:33,573
happens off the camera.

253
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:34,406
- Okay.

254
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:35,618
- So normally stuff that we'd edit out.

255
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:38,361
One thing is like my face gets oily,

256
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,718
and so I will use oil face wipes on my face

257
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:41,795
to make sure.

258
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,688
No we're not doing a brand product thing for it.

259
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:46,143
- I was going to face it the opposite way.

260
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,360
- Oh okay cool, let's do that.

261
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,660
- We're going to do it now

262
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,493
- We've wasted so much time.

263
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:51,669
- Don't give that free promo.

264
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:53,497
Here we go, so it's this stuff here.

265
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:54,330
Don't look at how much time we have left.

266
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,692
- We have five minutes left.

267
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,080
- That's half way, that's a lot of time.

268
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,913
- Oh okay.

269
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:58,746
- So yeah, it's this stuff here,

270
00:07:58,746 --> 00:07:59,593
and I'll demonstrate for you,

271
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:00,974
this little beauty tutorial.

272
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:03,961
So you take a wipey and you put it on your face,

273
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,311
and like my face isn't oily right now,

274
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:07,810
so nothing's going to happen, but normally you can see

275
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,638
how oily and disgusting your face is.

276
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:11,072
- I usually just kind of like do that.

277
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:12,198
- Yeah, so.

278
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:13,031
- That's it.

279
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:13,967
- Just with the sleeve.

280
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,118
So that's one thing that happens off camera.

281
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:18,518
A lot of "bro, how do my eyes look?"

282
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:19,351
Because when I laugh my eyes get red.

283
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,305
- Yeah, because when he laughs he cries, and then

284
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:23,005
when he cries, his eyes get bloodshot.

285
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:25,370
- And when I sneeze, because that will happen

286
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,502
in videos, that happens just about once every video

287
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:29,730
I film, and I hate sneezing.

288
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,938
Really don't like sneezing.

289
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:32,569
- I don't understand why though, it feels so good

290
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:33,402
to get it out.

291
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:35,813
- No, it's horrible, you whole body is like.

292
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:38,063
(laughter)

293
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:41,870
- It just like happens, there's nothing you can

294
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,854
do to stop it.

295
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:43,687
- Yeah.

296
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:45,321
- If you can stop it, you sit there like,

297
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:46,369
trying to not sneeze.

298
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,202
- That's the worst.

299
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:48,188
- Yeah.

300
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:50,595
So we got to serious up this video.

301
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:51,428
- Okay.

302
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,318
(laughter)

303
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,564
- That was too hard of a reversal.

304
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:58,639
- We need to keep the pace up here.

305
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,912
- Oh yeah, the pace up, exactly,

306
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:00,826
- The pace is very important.

307
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:02,411
- That's another thing, when I'm editing the videos,

308
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,197
I always take out the pauses in between everything.

309
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:07,621
- He takes out so many pauses that he cuts out his words.

310
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:08,454
- Yeah.

311
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:11,004
- He'll start on a word like "ta," like "ba" and then

312
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:12,366
start it, it's like.

313
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:13,667
- Yeah, I talk really fast as well.

314
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:14,500
- Yeah.

315
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,415
- I need to watch that for this video.

316
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:17,480
Because normally if I was talking really fast right now

317
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,313
I could say hey guys.

318
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:19,999
What's up guys.

319
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:20,832
- He messed it up.

320
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:22,275
- No, see I'd totally edit that out.

321
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,667
See how I went for the re-edit on it?

322
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,500
- Yeah.

323
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,395
- If I mess something up, usually if I'm talking

324
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:26,247
and I'm like "oh, that didn't work."

325
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:27,781
If I mess something up then I'll just cut right back to it.

326
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:28,614
- Yeah.

327
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:29,994
- So I'm going to try to say a sentence

328
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:31,815
really fast right now.

329
00:09:31,815 --> 00:09:32,698
What's up, it's Collins Key, welcome to the Thursday vlog

330
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:33,531
for today's video, we're going to be doing something

331
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,526
really fun, we're going to be doing the stripped down

332
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:35,432
challenge, so basically what's going to be happening

333
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:36,375
is that I need you guys to watch this video really closely,

334
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,653
and Devan is going to appear for me.

335
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:41,313
Like I can talk very quickly and so for videos,

336
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:44,462
I always need to make sure I slow myself down.

337
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:45,815
- Yeah.

338
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:46,648
- Yeah.

339
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:48,749
So that's what's going to happen.

340
00:09:48,749 --> 00:09:49,959
- I was just thinking about how much time we just like,

341
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,056
we do not have a lot of time.

342
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:54,557
- No, so right now I'm actually feeling more serious.

343
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:55,390
- Yeah.

344
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,461
- I think things are getting more serious,

345
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,127
I'm not quite there yet, so we'll hit it with one more

346
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,558
topic before we go,

347
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,590
into real serious insecurities,

348
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,544
because I feel like that, we need to be more

349
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:03,377
serious for that.

350
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:04,210
- Oh, fun fact.

351
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,043
- Oh yes.

352
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,006
- This is a really kind of embarrassing fun fact.

353
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:07,839
- About me?

354
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,672
- No, about myself.

355
00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:09,849
- Okay, good, I was like whew.

356
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:13,487
- I love Star Wars so much, I have 200 Star Wars

357
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,737
action figures.

358
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:18,595
- And another fun fact, we actually grew out our hair.

359
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:19,428
- Oh yeah.

360
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,537
- We grew those Padawan braids.

361
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,634
- Yup.

362
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:24,914
And I grew mine on the wrong side, so I was halfway

363
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:27,006
through growing it, and I cut it off,

364
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,571
and then started on a new side.

365
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,186
- Yup, that was a big one.

366
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:31,019
- That was not fun.

367
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:31,852
- That was a big one.

368
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:34,198
Another fun fact is Devan.

369
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,871
Can I tell them that you're always that side?

370
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:38,051
- Oh yeah.

371
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:40,671
- I didn't know if I could go into this,

372
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:41,504
but you go for it.

373
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:43,992
- We had debates because Collins thinks that

374
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:45,391
this side of my face.

375
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,511
- I think this side of my face looks.

376
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,985
- For some, I do not understand.

377
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:50,978
- We'll do this.

378
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:52,499
- They both look exactly the same.

379
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:53,332
- We'll go to this side first.

380
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:55,285
- Okay. - Ready, go.

381
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:56,202
Other side.

382
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,528
You guys comment down below, do they look the same

383
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:03,341
or different, because we both think that this side.

384
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:05,491
- Of his face looks the same as that side.

385
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:06,546
- No, no, no.

386
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:07,379
- We both think.

387
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,118
- But this side is totally different, look like.

388
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:10,579
The jawline kind of goes like that,

389
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:12,004
I have more of a distinct one on that side,

390
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,769
and then this side,

391
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,019
is like completely gone.

392
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,776
- Well I don't really have a jawline

393
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,109
that's my issue.

394
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:20,165
- Yeah you do.

395
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:20,998
- Oh!

396
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:21,831
- I think you do.

397
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:22,664
- Do I have a jawline, have you found one for me?

398
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:23,667
- I don't know.

399
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,233
Okay, shall we.

400
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:28,808
- That was the throat clearing of seriousness.

401
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:29,641
- What?

402
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:32,425
- Trying to stay still serious.

403
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,542
Yes, let's get serious Devan.

404
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,057
- Alright let's do it.

405
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:35,899
Insecurities.

406
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,281
- Yes, jump right in, you go first.

407
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,227
- No, you go first.

408
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:39,060
- Me?

409
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,893
- Yeah bro.

410
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:40,726
- Rock, paper, scissors?

411
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:41,559
- Okay, fine.

412
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,883
- [Together] Rock, paper.

413
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,937
- Just do rock, paper, scissors, whoever wins, wins.

414
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:47,786
- [Together] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

415
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:48,619
- Aww.

416
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:49,832
- You go first.

417
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:50,749
Ha, ha, ha.

418
00:11:57,798 --> 00:12:00,550
- I guess, we'll just throw it right out there.

419
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,647
I have a learning disability.

420
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:07,235
This video went like 100 to 0 real quick.

421
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:10,474
Sorry, okay, I needed to stay serious with this.

422
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:11,835
Well actually I don't, but this is something that

423
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:13,085
I want to talk.

424
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,183
I can't freaking do this, okay.

425
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:18,186
Think, stay focused, okay.

426
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:20,775
I literally throughout the beginning of it,

427
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:24,240
and then got unserious, and back in joke mode,

428
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,691
but I need to remain serious, give me a tissue.

429
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:29,613
I have an idea.

430
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:31,916
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

431
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,358
(laughter)

432
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:34,374
I can't stay serious.

433
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:35,207
- What is happening?

434
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:36,194
- I don't know.

435
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:37,297
- Should I just do mine or something?

436
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:38,130
- Yes, please.

437
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,433
- Because I need a second to get more serious.

438
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:40,266
- Oh wow.

439
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,498
- I've been laughing so much, you go.

440
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:46,665
- Okay, my biggest insecurity was, is, my skinniness.

441
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:50,337
No wait.

442
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,170
(laughter)

443
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,601
- Sorry.

444
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:56,003
I'm so sorry, like I'm trying to be serious, continue,

445
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:58,464
I am so sorry, wow this is bad.

446
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:01,004
- It was how skinny I am, and you could say,

447
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:04,864
oh I used to work out and stuff like that, which.

448
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:06,917
- What? We hit 10, wow.

449
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,212
Alright, you know what, we're just getting to the

450
00:13:09,212 --> 00:13:10,521
juicy parts, we're going to continue.

451
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:11,354
- Okay.

452
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:12,187
- If you guys don't want to watch.

453
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:13,285
- Oh you should work out, but my shoulder's actually

454
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,816
injured, so I haven't been able to work out for a year.

455
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:20,265
Which is not fun, but when I was about 13 and stuff

456
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:22,701
I didn't want to lift weights or anything because

457
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,207
I didn't want to stunt my growth, because I was

458
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:26,530
also shorter, I was a lot shorter, I didn't start

459
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,803
growing until I was like 15, so that was a big

460
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:33,388
insecurity of mine as well, because I was on a basketball

461
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:36,345
team and everyone was a lot taller than I was.

462
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:40,512
So I got injured, literally every single practice.

463
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:45,234
So it was my skinniness, I didn't even go places really,

464
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:47,032
I didn't enjoy going to the mall or anything,

465
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:51,095
because I just felt like people were judging me and stuff.

466
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:53,777
Yeah, I didn't hang out with anyone so I became

467
00:13:53,777 --> 00:13:56,186
really socially awkward and stuff,

468
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:59,497
and then now I'm just kind of able to laugh about it

469
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:02,525
and stuff because I've come to the realization that

470
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:04,882
you only live one life, so you might as well

471
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,182
just live it to the fullest.

472
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:07,340
- Yolo.

473
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,649
- Exactly.

474
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,844
- And just be happy with who you are,

475
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,749
so I'm happy with who I am now,

476
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:17,467
constantly improving though, and yeah, so that was it.

477
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:21,360
- Cool, so back where I kind of veered off.

478
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,612
I have a learning disability, and I've never talked about

479
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,779
this before with you guys.

480
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:28,972
And I'm dyslexic, so basically what that means is

481
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:32,243
reading is very challenging for me, and words always

482
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:35,543
get like mixed around, and letters get mixed around,

483
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,993
and that's why also spelling is very difficult for me.

484
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:40,228
So if you guys notice a lot of spelling errors on Twitter,

485
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:41,061
that's it.

486
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,001
And it was so bad that when I was younger,

487
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,582
I thought that I was stupid, and I thought that I was

488
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:49,665
not smart in any classes.

489
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:52,102
Like math was always very easy for me,

490
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:54,682
but for what ever reason, whenever I was English class

491
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:56,746
or whatever, all my friends were able to read

492
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:59,579
super easily, and super quick, and it took me a lot longer

493
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,130
to read things, even in tests and stuff, I would always

494
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,632
be the last person to finish, not because I didn't

495
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:06,092
know the information, just because it was difficult for me

496
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:09,911
to read all the different questions, and it was actually

497
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:10,826
so bad that.

498
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,329
I was always very creative in classes as well,

499
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,461
and there was one writing class that I was in,

500
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:16,932
and my spelling errors were all over the place,

501
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:18,831
but the stories were creative.

502
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:22,060
- He had the funniest stories, I was always so jealous

503
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,915
of his stories.

504
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:23,758
- Thank you.

505
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:25,242
- You literally has killer stories.

506
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:27,376
- Yeah, so, when I was reading my stories,

507
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,123
it was no issue, because I already knew what I

508
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:30,716
had written down, and it was very easy for me,

509
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:32,279
if I didn't know what it was exactly,

510
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,776
if I couldn't figure it out, I could always improv,

511
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:35,064
and just make it up.

512
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:38,701
But there was one teacher who, he saw my story on the table,

513
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:39,880
and picked it up, and noticed there was a couple

514
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,878
of spelling errors, and decided to read the paper

515
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:47,045
in front of the whole class with all the spelling errors,

516
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,712
and that was no fun.

517
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:52,459
Because no one else in the class knew that I wasn't

518
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,685
a good speller until that moment when he was reading

519
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:55,721
it out in front of the entire class,

520
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,728
and everyone's laughing at me, and at the spelling errors.

521
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:00,374
And literally to this day there will still be kids

522
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:02,699
who I know from that class who will come up to me

523
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,356
and be like "remember that one time in the class,

524
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:06,489
he was like reading your story, and like you spelled

525
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:07,973
walk as wack."

526
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:09,749
For whatever it was,

527
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:13,249
and that was a moment that was not so fun,

528
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:17,847
so I won't go into anymore, but I figured out how

529
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:22,569
to deal with it and stuff, but yeah, your turn.

530
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:24,093
- We're doing more?

531
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:25,344
- Yeah, let's do like one more each I think.

532
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,177
- One more each?

533
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:27,010
- One more each.

534
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,473
Because I know we've already passed the 10 minute mark.

535
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:30,545
- So then I'll hit the whole face region.

536
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:31,976
(laughter)

537
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:32,809
- Sorry, trying to be serious, what?

538
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:34,162
- Because my ears like,

539
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:37,259
for a long time, I've felt they're too big,

540
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,485
for my head, and then my nose kind of like,

541
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:40,318
like that.

542
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,018
- I don't see it on the nose.

543
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,512
- I wish I had a nose that was straight.

544
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:46,169
- Okay.

545
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:47,964
- Oh yeah, my smile, the reason I don't smile

546
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,420
in selfies is actually because I don't like

547
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,841
how they look in selfies.

548
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:51,797
- Really?

549
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:55,016
- Yeah, I've always been insecure about that,

550
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:57,980
because it's not like an even smile or anything.

551
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,813
So I've tried to get it more even,

552
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,468
but you have a great smile.

553
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:04,789
- I actually don't think so.

554
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:05,622
- Really?

555
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:07,503
- Like my smile, I feel like makes my face

556
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:08,913
look too long almost.

557
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:11,749
- For me, I feel like my face gets just scrunched,

558
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:14,652
and like wrinkly and all that stuff.

559
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:15,485
- Yeah.

560
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:17,377
- So that's why I don't smile in Instagram photos.

561
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:19,052
But I don't mind it if I'm with like friends

562
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:20,625
and stuff like that.

563
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,734
- Alright.

564
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:23,472
This one is going to sound kind of weird,

565
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:25,147
but height.

566
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:27,745
I've always been really tall, I'm 6'3",

567
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,527
and it doesn't sound like something that would be

568
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:31,811
a big insecurity, but growing up I was always the tallest

569
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:34,220
kid, and I don't know if you guys know this,

570
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,023
but with guys there's this thing to where if

571
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,126
one guy is taller than another guy,

572
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,832
the shorter guy is going to be intimidated

573
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:44,266
by the taller guy, and it's just I don't know.

574
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:47,242
It's just kind of how it is, and so, I didn't know this,

575
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:49,040
but when I was growing up, a whole bunch of kids

576
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,267
would always make fun of me, and tease me,

577
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:55,237
and I was always not part of the groups.

578
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:57,471
And it sucked that I didn't know what was going on.

579
00:17:57,471 --> 00:17:59,576
My mom finally explained to me what was happening,

580
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:01,414
and why it was always happening, it's because,

581
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,831
I was always way tall for my age.

582
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:07,213
And that's what intimidated the other guys.

583
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,021
Even I remember there was one time, I was at,

584
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,186
a group photo, and there were doing this big,

585
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:14,295
like all these different grades, and I was in line,

586
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:17,248
with kids who were in high school, even though I was

587
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:19,319
I think 10 at the time,

588
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,589
and I was in line with the kids who were in high school.

589
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:22,849
And there was one kid who was in high school,

590
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,686
but he was shorter than me, and so he was standing

591
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,068
on this side, and he looked at me and was like

592
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:28,181
"bro, you're kind of like a freak man, you're so tall,

593
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:29,289
what the heck, how old are you?"

594
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:30,122
I'm like, "I'm 10."

595
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:31,512
He was like "dude, you're only 10 years old,

596
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:32,732
that's just weird."

597
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:35,587
Then everyone kind of started ripping on me,

598
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:37,801
"dude, like you're 10, you're way too tall bro."

599
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:39,852
That just kind of.

600
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,783
Oh my God! There's literally a spider.

601
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:43,616
- No.

602
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:44,995
- Oh my God!

603
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:45,828
- [Devan] Where is it?

604
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:46,661
- [Collins] I don't know bro.

605
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:47,494
- [Devan] Where is it?

606
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:48,327
There it is.

607
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,160
- [Collins] Where, where, where, where, where, where?

608
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,993
- [Devan] I see it, I see it, I see it.

609
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:50,826
- [Collins] Get a tissue, get a tissue.

610
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:51,670
- [Devan] I can't.

611
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,503
- [Collins] Where is it?

612
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:53,336
- [Devan] I have a huge fear of spiders.

613
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:55,176
- [Collins] Oh my God, straight up, a real big fear.

614
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,009
- [Devan] I don't like spiders.

615
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,676
- [Collins] Hey dad!

616
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,646
Yo dad.

617
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:01,299
- Yo, can you grab a glass.

618
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,180
- [Collins] Yeah, we need a glass, like pronto bro.

619
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,513
- It's a spider.

620
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,245
- Seriously, we need a glass.

621
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,078
- Can you please?

622
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:09,602
Oh my gosh, it's missing a leg.

623
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:10,435
- It's missing a leg?

624
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:11,268
- It is.

625
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:12,101
- It's in my room.

626
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:12,934
Okay, Steven come on.

627
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:13,836
- And I can't tell if it's facing me.

628
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,096
- Dad, do you have a glass?

629
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:16,762
Can you get it, it's right there.

630
00:19:16,762 --> 00:19:18,509
Bro, it's gonna like move, can you get it?

631
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:19,342
- [Dad] Where is it?

632
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:20,175
- It's right there.

633
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,008
- It's right there.

634
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,226
- [Dad] It's a black one, not a big deal.

635
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,710
- Yeah, but it's huge.

636
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,543
- Yeah, those are kind of a big deal.

637
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,376
- It was huge.

638
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:26,209
It came like right at us.

639
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:27,042
- It came at his foot.

640
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:27,875
(Collins screams)

641
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,125
(laughter)

642
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,547
- Oh my God.

643
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:35,502
- Our dad is the best.

644
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:36,527
- He put it right in my face.

645
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:37,658
Alright.

646
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:38,896
Hey dad, can you turn off the bathroom light,

647
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:40,428
because it kind of effects the sound.

648
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:41,994
(laughter)

649
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:44,322
- We deal with this so much, literally in filming.

650
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:45,326
- Our door is open.

651
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:47,024
So I think on that note.

652
00:19:47,024 --> 00:19:47,857
(laughter)

653
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:49,573
Did he flush the toilet?

654
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:51,758
That was the spider, not you right dad?

655
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:52,713
- Yeah, it was the spider.

656
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:53,839
- You flushed the toilet, the spider down the toilet.

657
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,733
- There is no way he went that fast.

658
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:55,566
- [Dad] It's all good

659
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:56,404
(laughter)
