1
00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:01,864
(screaming)

2
00:00:01,864 --> 00:00:03,512
- [Both] Three, two, one.

3
00:00:03,512 --> 00:00:04,512
- No! - Yeah!

4
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:07,225
- Dude, I have to eat Spam.

5
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:09,213
No, I have to make a Spam smoothie

6
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:10,616
because you guys challenged us to do

7
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:12,313
the Halloween smoothie challenge.

8
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,614
One is a delicious item, like a caramel apple

9
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,780
and one is a terrible item, like Spam.

10
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,396
- Bro, that smells so bad.

11
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:19,767
- Oh, no.

12
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:20,768
- I can't, why?

13
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:21,766
You ready, three.

14
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:22,599
- Are we doing it at the same time?

15
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:23,432
- Yeah. - All right.

16
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:24,349
- Two, one.

17
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,398
(squealing)

18
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:31,040
- I didn't even get the apple.

19
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,540
Bro, are you good?

20
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:34,993
You can't even get it out.

21
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:35,826
Bro.

22
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:37,046
- Yeet!

23
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:38,862
(can clunking on the floor)

24
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:40,583
- Bro, you dented our floor.

25
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,170
(gagging)

26
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,416
- And at the end of this, we're gonna be

27
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,573
blending up the weirdest smoothies in the world

28
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:47,194
and then, drinking them, so stick around for that,

29
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:48,783
but right now we are on to the next round.

30
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:49,887
Let's go.

31
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:51,872
For the next ingredient, Devan, you get to choose.

32
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:53,411
Do you wanna keep them or switch them.

33
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:54,406
- Ooh, I get to choose?

34
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:56,086
I wanna switch them.

35
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:56,919
- Switch them?

36
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:57,752
- Yep. - All right.

37
00:00:57,752 --> 00:00:58,609
So, yours has a spoon, which means it's either really good

38
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:01,145
or really bad. - Oh, no.

39
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,441
- Here we go, are you ready?

40
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,523
- I've got a bad feeling about this.

41
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:05,507
- [Both] Three, two, one.

42
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:06,424
- Yes! - No!

43
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:09,476
- I get to do pumpkin spice cupcakes.

44
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:11,242
- Aw, Mayonnaise?

45
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:13,009
- [Collins] Well, there's your spoon.

46
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,321
- That looks so good.

47
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:16,646
(angelic music)

48
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:17,499
- Bro, cupcakes.

49
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:18,693
(kissing noises)

50
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:19,624
- Can we switch?

51
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:20,813
- You had your chance earlier

52
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:22,173
and you had a good thing in front of you,

53
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:23,192
but you messed it up.

54
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:24,403
- I don't even wanna smell it.

55
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:28,143
The smell of mayonnaise and Spam mixed together.

56
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:29,951
I can't even describe it.

57
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:31,424
- You might wanna mix it up a little bit, bro.

58
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,079
- I wanna mix it up. - The top has gotten crusty.

59
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,755
(mayonnaise squishing)

60
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:35,894
Ew, the sound!

61
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:36,727
(squealing)

62
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:37,560
Ready?

63
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,393
- No.

64
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:39,226
- All right, so you take your bite,

65
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:40,701
I'm gonna chuck it up and I'm gonna catch it in my mouth

66
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:41,668
'cuz I'm coordinated.

67
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,168
- Three, two, one.

68
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:48,257
Oh, my gosh, is it that bad?

69
00:01:48,257 --> 00:01:50,109
(screaming and gagging)

70
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,521
Ow!

71
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:52,354
Ow!

72
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:55,133
You gotta kinda first dangle.

73
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,296
- You need to add a lot to counter that Spam.

74
00:01:57,296 --> 00:01:58,155
- Yeah, for sure.

75
00:01:58,155 --> 00:01:59,336
I wanna take my smoothie to the next level.

76
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:02,210
Usually you would remove the cupcake from its wrapping.

77
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,181
- No.

78
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,014
(laughing)

79
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:04,847
- My bad.

80
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:05,680
Bro, this is legit.

81
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,781
They're, like, sticking to the sides.

82
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:07,614
(coughing)

83
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:08,447
It's like a wall of cupcakes.

84
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:09,280
- I know.

85
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,113
- Woo hoo!

86
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:10,998
- Oh!

87
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,492
All right, Collins, it is your turn.

88
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:13,814
Do you wanna keep it or switch it?

89
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:15,177
- I don't wanna run into a trick.

90
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,241
I only want the treat.

91
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:17,245
I'm gonna keep it.

92
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:18,078
- You're gonna keep it, all right.

93
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:18,911
- I have no idea if that was the right decision.

94
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:19,744
- All right.

95
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:22,630
- [Both] Three, two, one.

96
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,579
- No! Wait, what?

97
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,650
Soy sauce?

98
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,206
At first, I was like, Coca Cola in a weird bottle.

99
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:29,022
- Dude, this is literally almond milk

100
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:31,970
pumpkin spice with cinnamon, limited edition.

101
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,966
The edition, it's limited.

102
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:35,612
- You know what, I'm just gonna pretend it's a nice

103
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:38,334
Coca Cola cold beverage.

104
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:39,187
- Yeah, that's not gonna work.

105
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:40,437
Ready, set, go.

106
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:45,353
(coughing)

107
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,971
- So salty!

108
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:48,246
- Dude, mine's delicious.

109
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:49,459
- Bro!

110
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:50,654
(coughing)

111
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:51,867
- Okay, bro, you need.

112
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:52,763
- No!

113
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:53,999
How's yours?

114
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,457
- Dude, mine's so good.

115
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:56,857
Devan, your drink needs a liquid base.

116
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:58,259
- No. - You need a liquid base.

117
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:00,340
- No, I'll hope for a better liquid base.

118
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,576
- Dude, look at just the color of it.

119
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:04,055
It looks as good as it tastes, man.

120
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:05,976
I mean, it tastes as good as it looks.

121
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:07,140
It just tastes really good.

122
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,662
Oh, yeah. - That looks really full.

123
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:09,579
- Oh, yeah.

124
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:11,621
Yeet!

125
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,201
My smoothie is actually starting to look really delicious

126
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:15,772
until I remember there's a big chunk of Spam in it,

127
00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:17,391
but right now, for the next ingredient,

128
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:18,668
Devan, do you wanna keep it or switch it?

129
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:21,145
- You know what, I had some bad luck with switching it.

130
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:22,550
- All right. - So, I'm gonna switch it.

131
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,383
- What?

132
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:24,463
That makes no sense.

133
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:26,319
- [Both] Three, two, one.

134
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,152
- No!

135
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,345
- [Collins] Dude, two onions.

136
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:31,861
- Bro!

137
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,405
- I get, like, a lovely, little pie.

138
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:34,766
Oh, my gosh, man.

139
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:36,476
I am loving this challenge.

140
00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:38,386
- Not happy about this.

141
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:39,284
- All right, so I guess--

142
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,117
How do I eat my--

143
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:40,950
(spitting)

144
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,012
I think I had some onion residue on my hands.

145
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:43,200
- I'll probably cry.

146
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,218
- Yeah, if Devan starts crying at some point, guys,

147
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:48,774
just know it's been a very emotional day for him.

148
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:49,945
- No, it's the onion.

149
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:50,778
- It has nothing to do with the onion.

150
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:51,611
- It's the onion. - Don't hold it

151
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,314
close to me, please. - Don't believe him.

152
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:55,763
- [Collins] There we go, there we go, there we go.

153
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:56,720
I got it, I got it, I got it.

154
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,137
Okay, here we go.

155
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,042
- I don't even wanna know.

156
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:00,893
- Dude!

157
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:01,867
It's so good!

158
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,006
- I'm sure it's amazing.

159
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:03,854
- Oh, my god.

160
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:05,115
I will, with pleasure, man.

161
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:06,379
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

162
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,426
No, no, it's too much

163
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:08,878
(sputtering words)

164
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:11,662
- Meanwhile, I have finally finished peeling my onion.

165
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:12,727
- Oh, dude.

166
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,493
My eyes are gonna start watering.

167
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:15,342
I can smell it.

168
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:16,356
That's so potent. - Tell me about it.

169
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,050
- I've got funky Spam breath and now,

170
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,096
you're gonna have onion breath.

171
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:19,944
Oh, my gosh. - Three.

172
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:21,000
Like and apple.

173
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,161
Two.

174
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,140
This is not gonna taste like an apple.

175
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,309
One. - Wait, wait, wait.

176
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:27,190
First, we have a five second challenge for you.

177
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,175
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

178
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,892
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

179
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:32,750
- Yep - Are you ready.

180
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,248
- [Both] Five, four, three

181
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:35,331
two one, done

182
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,711
- If you did that, leave a comment below,

183
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,763
Keyper squad, right now.

184
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,217
And Devan, it's time to eat your onion.

185
00:04:41,217 --> 00:04:42,451
- All right, here we go.

186
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:43,349
- Oh, my gosh.

187
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,901
(onion crunching)

188
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:47,901
Oh, my gosh!

189
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:50,752
- All right, on to the other one.

190
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:52,344
- Holy cow, you just did that, bro.

191
00:04:52,344 --> 00:04:53,674
Are you okay? (screaming)

192
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:54,507
- No.

193
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:56,315
- Bro, yours looks so good.

194
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:57,441
- That came in so loud out of nowhere,

195
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:58,477
I was like what?

196
00:04:58,477 --> 00:05:00,327
- The fate is in your hands.

197
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:01,270
- Okay. - Will you get a bad one

198
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,103
or a good one?

199
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:03,444
- I'll switch it, bro.

200
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:04,685
- [Both] All right, here we go.

201
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:06,018
Three, two, one.

202
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:07,830
- Yeah!

203
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:10,313
- No!

204
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:12,286
I got New England clam chowder.

205
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:14,670
- My first good one in a million years.

206
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,519
- Wait, wait, wait.

207
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,895
Are these, like, candy corn peeps?

208
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:17,751
- [Devan] Are they?

209
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,829
- [Collins] Whoa!

210
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:21,015
- It's got like it's dipped in white chocolate.

211
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:21,989
Oh, my goodness.

212
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,836
- And these ones here are dipped in regular chocolate.

213
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:25,701
- Hey, don't touch it.

214
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,551
It's mine.

215
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,551
Ew. - Oh, no.

216
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:30,097
- I'm so glad I didn't get that.

217
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,824
Oh, bro! (shouting)

218
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:32,673
Move it over there.

219
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:33,575
I don't wanna smell it. - Okay.

220
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:34,510
- Should I just eat mine now?

221
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,516
- Yeah, let's go for it. - All right, cool.

222
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:38,243
Ooh, oh, this looks so good!

223
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:39,091
Mmm!

224
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:39,977
- How is it?

225
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:40,827
- So good!

226
00:05:40,827 --> 00:05:41,772
- Yo!

227
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:43,545
Why is it so chunky?

228
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:44,747
(bell chiming)

229
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:45,637
- Bro, it's chunky!

230
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,979
It's looking mad funky.

231
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:47,906
You ready?

232
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:48,739
- Oh, I'm so happy I'm not doing this.

233
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:49,683
- I need a bigger spoonful too,

234
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,922
'cuz it's gotta go ham. (buzzer)

235
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:52,480
Clam. (laughing)

236
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,526
(rim shot sound effect)

237
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:55,359
Okay, three, two, one.

238
00:05:57,838 --> 00:05:59,358
- Ooh!

239
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,497
Oh, I feel so bad for you,

240
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:04,134
but I'm so happy I didn't get it, at the same time.

241
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:05,279
- All right, we're gonna add. - All right.

242
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,311
- Oh!

243
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:07,249
- I'm adding all of mine.

244
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,285
- Ugh! Why?

245
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,562
For the next ingredient, Devan,

246
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:10,608
do you wanna keep 'em or switch 'em?

247
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:11,574
I think you should switch it

248
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:12,907
'cuz you've had amazing luck with that.

249
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,279
- I'm actually gonna switch it 'cuz there's no chance

250
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,871
it's gonna happen three times, right?

251
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:18,466
- All right, something's green on your side.

252
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:19,877
- Three, two. - I'm so nervous.

253
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:21,239
- One. - Really?

254
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:24,572
- No! (Collins cheering)

255
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:26,597
Three times!

256
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:27,807
- I thought for sure there was no way

257
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:28,799
you were gonna switch it

258
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:29,755
'cuz every time you switched it, it was bad.

259
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,343
- What are the chances?

260
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:32,933
- Wasabi peas!

261
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,951
(laughing)

262
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:39,413
I got fall flavored Skittles, M&Ms, and, like, big M&Ms.

263
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:40,991
Oh, my gosh.

264
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:41,970
Blessed.

265
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,229
Wasabi peas, those are gonna be terrible.

266
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,256
- These are gonna be spicy, and terrible,

267
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,655
and all of the above.

268
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:49,365
(sniffing)

269
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:50,198
Oh!

270
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:51,309
- I'm gonna try all three of my flavors,

271
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:52,548
and then, you can eat your wasabi peas.

272
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:53,408
- All right.

273
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:54,575
- Wasabi peas.

274
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,208
(laughing)

275
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,041
- Oh!

276
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:00,437
- Oh, yeah!

277
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:02,223
Candy corn M&Ms, bro.

278
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:05,556
This is just, oh, my gosh, my lucky day.

279
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,631
(muffled talking with mouth full)

280
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:10,582
- [Devan] You know it's good

281
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:11,684
when you can't understand Collins.

282
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:13,263
- This is the best day I've ever had.

283
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:15,126
The best wish ever.

284
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:17,003
And, to complete the trifecta of deliciousness,

285
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,138
pumpkin pie M&Ms.

286
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,388
(laughing)

287
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,320
I mean, these are delicious, bro.

288
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,078
Oh, my gosh.

289
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:29,835
I missed all of them. - You missed all of them.

290
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:30,702
- Bro!

291
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:31,535
Yeet!

292
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,535
It fell out of my mouth.

293
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,796
- That yeet went nowhere.

294
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:38,506
- That yeet was not yeet-eee.

295
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:39,838
Is my tongue weird?

296
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:40,693
(laughing)

297
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,721
- It looks very orange.

298
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,055
It's like a pumpkin tongue.

299
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:43,909
- Yeah!

300
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,153
- Here we go, the moment that I'm not excited about.

301
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:47,818
Three, two, one.

302
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:48,651
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

303
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:51,230
First, we have a three second like challenge, right now.

304
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,082
Can you like this video in three seconds?

305
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:53,915
Here we go, are you ready?

306
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:56,893
- [Both] Three, two, one, done

307
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,770
- All right, there we go.

308
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,693
(peas crunching)

309
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:02,542
- Oh!

310
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:03,450
Oh!

311
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,427
(screaming)

312
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:05,587
Whoa!

313
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:06,811
- Dude, I can smell the wasabi.

314
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:08,414
It's like singeing me, bro.

315
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:09,460
- It's all over my lips.

316
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,451
Oh!

317
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:11,640
Onto the next one.

318
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,550
- Onto the next one?

319
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,409
Are you good?

320
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,257
- No!

321
00:08:14,257 --> 00:08:15,090
- Yeah, yeah, put some M&Ms, yeah.

322
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,923
Open up your mouth, bro.

323
00:08:15,923 --> 00:08:16,855
I've got M&Ms right here.

324
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:17,864
- Oh, the combination!

325
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:18,886
- The combination's bad?

326
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:19,863
It's like a weird food combination, right?

327
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:20,696
(screaming)

328
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:23,157
Bro, so far you have not been doing good with switching it,

329
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:24,914
but I have, so I'm gonna switch it.

330
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:26,641
Every time we switch, it's been fantastic.

331
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:27,976
- Oh, no. - Here we go.

332
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:30,096
- [Both] Three, two, one.

333
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:32,436
- No! (Collins laughing)

334
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:33,888
- What if I did this?

335
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,924
What is it?

336
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:36,078
- Oh, it's cat food!

337
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:37,125
No!

338
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,111
I can already smell this.

339
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,071
- And, we have no idea what's under what tray,

340
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:42,673
so the fact that I've gotten all the good ones,

341
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:44,347
this is so funny!

342
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:45,881
Dude, I even got sugar cookies.

343
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:47,677
(laughing)

344
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:49,124
Bro, get that away from my cookies.

345
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:51,187
- It smells even worse than the last one

346
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:54,181
and the one before that and the one before that

347
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:55,302
and the one before that.

348
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,705
You look like you're enjoying it so much.

349
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:59,504
I just wanna experience that just one time.

350
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:00,496
Please?

351
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:01,966
I just want some of these crumbs.

352
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:02,890
- No! - What?

353
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,772
- Do not eat my crumbs.

354
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:04,670
Eat your cat food

355
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,950
- Oh, no. - Dude, I can't

356
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,650
believe you've gotten all the bad ones.

357
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,983
- Same, dude.

358
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:09,831
Same.

359
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:11,162
- [Collins] Dude, what are those red chunks?

360
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:12,247
- I don't even wanna know.

361
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:14,963
- Bro, the consistency of the liquid is like mucus, bro.

362
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:16,262
- Don't even mention it. - Like, I'm getting

363
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:17,401
sick just looking at it.

364
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,249
I can't even look.

365
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:19,305
That's disgusting. - Don't even mention it.

366
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:20,692
My stomach's already queasy.

367
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:21,723
Are you ready?

368
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:22,572
- Yeah.

369
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:23,426
- All right here we go. - Yeah.

370
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:25,311
- Three, two.

371
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,144
One.

372
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:30,929
(grunting)

373
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:32,450
- Oh, my gosh.

374
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,347
- So gross.

375
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:35,178
It's so gross. - It's so gross?

376
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:37,232
Yo, guys, Devan is a trooper.

377
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:40,584
Like you've don all the worst things in this entire video.

378
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:42,029
- I know, I can't believe it

379
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,437
and this smoothie is gonna be the worst of it all.

380
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:45,286
- I know.

381
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:46,411
I'm gonna make a little cookie tower

382
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:48,057
'cuz I have sugar cookies and I get to make

383
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:49,023
a cookie tower, now.

384
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:49,904
- That's great.

385
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:51,404
Oh, it's so gross.

386
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,965
- So, Devan. - Yeah?

387
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,081
- The moment of truth,

388
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:56,978
do you wanna keep it or switch it

389
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:58,951
because we know what's happened every time

390
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:00,799
you've switched it, so what do you wanna do?

391
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,773
- There is no chance,

392
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:05,276
no chance it's gonna happen for,

393
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:07,924
what is this, the fourth or fifth time?

394
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:08,822
- I don't know. - I don't know,

395
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:09,986
I'm switching it. - Switching it?

396
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:10,819
All right. - I'm doing it.

397
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,652
I'm doing it.

398
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,735
- [Both] Three, two, one.

399
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:16,074
- Yes!

400
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,587
- Yeet!

401
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:18,700
- No, uh uh.

402
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,706
You don't get to do that, fam.

403
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:20,624
- You gotta eat it. - Dude, my smoothie

404
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:21,585
does not need broccoli.

405
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:22,460
- You gotta eat that.

406
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,344
You go retrieve your yeet.

407
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:24,177
- All right.

408
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:27,127
- These are dark sea salt caramel marshmallows.

409
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,173
- That sounds delicious.

410
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:29,653
- Carrots, I like carrots. - Yeah.

411
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:30,610
- Mmm.

412
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,943
- Kids, eat your vegetables.

413
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:36,975
- How is it?

414
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:38,159
- I think I got used to all the sugar,

415
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,080
so there's definitely no sugar.

416
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,603
I mean, hey, I like vegetables, so, yeah.

417
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:43,271
I'm gonna need a healthy food

418
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:44,959
after all the candy I've been eating.

419
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:45,827
That's for sure.

420
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:46,660
- Oh!

421
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:48,382
Yeah!

422
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:49,915
No!

423
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,262
There we go, it's out.

424
00:10:51,262 --> 00:10:52,113
- Oh, my gosh.

425
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:53,779
It's got sea salt on it.

426
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:54,773
- I love this.

427
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:55,997
- [Collins] That looks so good.

428
00:10:55,997 --> 00:10:56,949
- I can't wait.

429
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,349
I'm so ready.

430
00:10:58,349 --> 00:10:59,995
Mmm.

431
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:01,654
I want this moment to last forever.

432
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:03,735
- That looks so delicious!

433
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,466
- Well, it is, so, be jealous.

434
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:06,936
- His eyes are closed it's so good, man.

435
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:08,515
He's just enjoying it so much.

436
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:09,754
(buzzer)

437
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:10,763
- All right, here we go.

438
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:12,490
Time to add it in.

439
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,751
- Oh, that looks so good.

440
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:15,634
- No! (bell chiming)

441
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,491
Get that out of there.

442
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:17,714
Yeet.

443
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:19,145
All right, Collins, it is your turn.

444
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,008
Do you wanna keep it or switch it?

445
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:22,286
- Bro, I'm feeling spontaneous.

446
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:23,372
I'm gonna keep it.

447
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:24,223
- Okay.

448
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:25,073
- Okay.

449
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:27,425
- [Both] Three, two, one.

450
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:28,425
- Yeah! - No!

451
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,422
- This is awesome! - You know what it is?

452
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,382
Like, are you, like, sneaking a peek before.

453
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:34,251
- No, I promise.

454
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:35,800
I literally have no idea what's under these.

455
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,796
- What is going on?

456
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,922
- And you got mustard.

457
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:39,191
Yellow mustard.

458
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:40,041
Oh, my gosh, bro.

459
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,080
What do I have?

460
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,367
I got apple pie and pumpkin pie.

461
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:44,218
Dude.

462
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:45,500
Oh, I have an idea!

463
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,146
So, I'm gonna peel one apart

464
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:48,925
and I'm gonna create a super Oreo.

465
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:49,784
- A double decker.

466
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:50,967
- [Collins] With two different flavors.

467
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,138
- [Devan] Oh, that's cool

468
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:54,010
- I've got innovation in my finger tips.

469
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,769
This is apple pie and pumpkin pie Oreo.

470
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:58,085
Come on, you can't eat all my Oreos.

471
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:58,918
Come on.

472
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,751
All right, here we go.

473
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,084
Three, two, one.

474
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:03,666
- How is it? - Mmm!

475
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,672
Bro! - What?

476
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:07,379
- Together they burst into flavors all over again

477
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,037
(explosion noises)

478
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:11,279
- You're really into the bursting of flavors.

479
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,914
- With pleasure.

480
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:13,933
(giggling)

481
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,212
- All right, it is my turn

482
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,844
to have some mustard. - Squirt it

483
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:17,867
in your mouth, bro. - I will, I will.

484
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:18,964
I can't believe it.

485
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:19,891
Why?

486
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:22,891
(mustard squirting)

487
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:25,330
(laughing)

488
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,562
- Bro, you got mustard all over your shirt.

489
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:29,678
That's, like, never gonna come out.

490
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:30,511
Ever.

491
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:32,354
We are on to the next one, Devan.

492
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:33,532
I am so sorry.

493
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:35,288
Now, your shirt's ruined, your smoothie's ruined,

494
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,719
your day is gonna be ruined next.

495
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,568
Let's go.

496
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:38,760
So far, Devan, you have had

497
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,663
(coughing)

498
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,258
Right now, Devan, the choice is yours.

499
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:42,666
Do you wanna keep it or switch it?

500
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,498
- You know what, I've switched it every single time

501
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,389
and something bad has happened.

502
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:48,240
- Yep.

503
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,186
- I'm going to keep it

504
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,285
for the first time in this entire challenge.

505
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:53,156
- Are you sure?

506
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:54,121
- No, I'm not

507
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,551
'cuz this could be my downfall,

508
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:56,669
but we'll find out.

509
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:57,502
Ready? - All right.

510
00:12:57,502 --> 00:13:00,146
- [Both] Three, two, one.

511
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,806
- Yeah! - No!

512
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:03,556
- Yes, yes, yes! - No.

513
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,454
- [Spongebob] One hour later.

514
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:07,696
- Yeah!

515
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:09,195
I learned from my mistakes

516
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:10,905
and I got a good one.

517
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:12,168
- [Collins] I got cat treats.

518
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:13,191
- Yes!

519
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:14,507
- These are treats for cats.

520
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:15,474
- Yes!

521
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:16,451
- What are they though?

522
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:17,487
What are those?

523
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:19,529
- [Devan] They're pumpkin spice marshmallows.

524
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,029
I don't know.

525
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:21,862
- Are they delicious?

526
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:22,695
- Oh, my gosh.

527
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:23,528
It's like a cloud.

528
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:24,588
A cinnamon cloud.

529
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:26,602
- Bro, you know cats, man.

530
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:27,920
I don't know where I was going with that sentence.

531
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,252
I was like, you know cats, man,

532
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:30,102
and then, just stopped.

533
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,466
It says these are not suitable for humans.

534
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:33,673
All right, we got to move on to the next one,

535
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:34,523
can't eat these,

536
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,441
it says not suitable for humans.

537
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,108
(bag crinkling)

538
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:40,802
Dude, these are tiny!

539
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:41,696
Look at these little things, man.

540
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,491
They're like little cereal things.

541
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,952
- How is it?

542
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:46,456
Bro, you gotta do more than that.

543
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:48,527
Come on, come on.

544
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,562
There you go.

545
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,370
(screaming)

546
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,594
(kibble crunching)

547
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:53,427
- Oh!

548
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:58,238
(muffled speech)

549
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,460
- Okay.

550
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,547
All right, bro, it is your turn.

551
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:01,741
Do you wanna keep it or switch it?

552
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,004
- See, man, I'm feeling saucy right now

553
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:04,681
and right now, I'm gonna keep it.

554
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:05,837
- You're gonna keep it. - Yes.

555
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:06,792
- All right, here we go.

556
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:09,307
- [Both] Three, two, one.

557
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,392
- Yeah, wait.

558
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,324
- Yeah!

559
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:12,178
What is that?

560
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:14,566
- It's cold brew, pure black.

561
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:15,415
- [Collins] Coffee?

562
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:16,266
- I guess.

563
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,707
I've literally never seen this before.

564
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:18,820
- I got pumpkin butter, bro.

565
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,720
- I gotta, oh, man.

566
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,886
Look at that.

567
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:21,803
Smell that!

568
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:24,397
- It kinda smells like baby food

569
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,856
and reminds me of all those times we've had baby food.

570
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,027
- It's called pumpkin butter, Devan.

571
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:29,425
(sniffing) Oh, my goodness.

572
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:30,484
That is intense.

573
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:31,576
- Oh, I can smell it from over here.

574
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:32,409
- Woo!

575
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:33,431
- I'll go first and then, you go

576
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:34,264
- All right. - 'Cuz I wanna see

577
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:35,147
how hyper you get after the coffee.

578
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:37,747
All right. (chuckling)

579
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:38,580
(dramatic sting)

580
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,688
- Remind you of baby food?

581
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:40,585
Yeah.

582
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:41,524
Yes.

583
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:42,357
The tides have turned.

584
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:43,677
In a sneak attack.

585
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:44,693
It was a little sneak attack.

586
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:46,904
It was like, oh, this is a great one, pumpkin butter,

587
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:47,935
but no, fam.

588
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,699
It's like baby food is gross.

589
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:51,285
(gagging)

590
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:52,134
Oh, this is good.

591
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:53,585
I need a liquid base for my smoothie,

592
00:14:53,585 --> 00:14:54,788
so I'm actually excited about this.

593
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,198
- I literally just said that.

594
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:57,818
- Dude, your drink needs a liquid base.

595
00:14:57,818 --> 00:14:58,687
- Oh. - Yeah.

596
00:14:58,687 --> 00:14:59,520
- All right, here we go.

597
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,353
Ready? - Yeah.

598
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:01,853
- Three, two, one.

599
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,119
Hmm.

600
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:05,989
- Is it good?

601
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,981
- It actually tasted like water, at first.

602
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:09,829
- Really?

603
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:13,372
- And then, I just have an aftertaste of coffee beans.

604
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,820
- So, I'm gonna add my pumpkin butter.

605
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,837
Oh! That's too much!

606
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:17,536
All right, Devan, so, I guess you can use that

607
00:15:17,536 --> 00:15:18,514
as your liquid base.

608
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:20,392
So, Devan's gonna have, like, a coffee version

609
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:21,286
of a weird smoothie.

610
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:23,191
So, Devan, you've now had a few good ones.

611
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:24,632
You've been able to taste the glory,

612
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,550
you had the treat, not the trick,

613
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,882
so what do you wanna do right now?

614
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:29,214
You wanna keep it or switch it?

615
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:31,050
'Cuz I have a feeling, this one is gonna be pretty intense.

616
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,180
- Bro, I have no idea,

617
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,247
but right now, I feel like the caffeine kinda kicked in

618
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,464
and I'm a little, little, little bit hyper right now.

619
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:37,719
I don't even know which one I wanna go.

620
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,250
I wanna keep it 'cuz that's been doing

621
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,099
a good job for me, so I'm gonna keep it.

622
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:40,969
- All right. - So, here we go.

623
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,329
- [Both] Three, two, one.

624
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:43,162
- Yeah!

625
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,695
Yeah!

626
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,948
- [Collins] Sriracha hot sauce.

627
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:48,944
- Woo hoo!

628
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:50,708
- I hope you never go to Starbucks ever.

629
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,925
(laughing)

630
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:52,945
- Geeze. Yeet!

631
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:53,778
- Mmm!

632
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:54,611
- Is it good?

633
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:56,251
- Oh, my, bro, better than you can even--

634
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:57,218
- Dude, I wanna. - Uh uh!

635
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:58,051
No. - Yes, yes.

636
00:15:58,051 --> 00:15:58,884
- Nope.

637
00:15:58,884 --> 00:15:59,717
Uh uh.

638
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:00,813
- No, I wanna try a little bit.

639
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:01,888
Stop, okay!

640
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:03,316
I should not challenge Devan

641
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:04,484
while he's crazy hyper off of coffee.

642
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:05,397
- No!

643
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,823
No. - Yep.

644
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:07,671
- Can't do that.

645
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:09,921
(giggling)

646
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:13,026
- Bro, your teeth are all blue.

647
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:13,954
- I know what's going on.

648
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:16,654
You cannot yeet this away from me.

649
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:17,629
No, fam.

650
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:18,921
Bro, is my tongue blue?

651
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:21,272
Is it blue? - Yeah, it's blue.

652
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,372
- All right, cool.

653
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:23,205
- Stick your tongue out and close your eyes.

654
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:24,038
- No, I won't.

655
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:25,185
No, uh uh!

656
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,018
- All right, here we go.

657
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,018
Three, oh, no, two, one.

658
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,030
- No, fam

659
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,298
Squeeze it. (Collins shouting)

660
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:32,716
Squeeze it. (Collins shouting)

661
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:33,752
- Ow, ow, ow!

662
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:34,937
It burns, it burns, it burns.

663
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:35,770
Why would you do that?

664
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,603
You got it in my face.

665
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:37,436
Why would you do that?

666
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:38,269
Ow!

667
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,102
Dude!

668
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:40,295
- Bro, I'm so sorry.

669
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:41,575
- That was so close to my eye.

670
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:43,365
- I thought it would just go right in your mouth.

671
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:45,572
You, like, moved it as I squeezed it.

672
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,219
- My face is kinda, like, on fire right now.

673
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:48,265
- Hands away, I won't do anything.

674
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:49,265
- Thank you.

675
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:52,513
- Bro, you've gotta put more on.

676
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,890
That's, like, nothing.

677
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,760
- Ow, ow!

678
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,717
Oh, Jesus!

679
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:56,550
- Really, bro?

680
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,520
- Okay, it burns, it burns.

681
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,464
I would never do well on hot ones, bro

682
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:02,187
'cuz I have a terrible spice pain tolerance bro.

683
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,132
So, this, right now, is the final round.

684
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:07,895
The final ingredient to complete our masterpiece smoothies.

685
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,800
Both of them have kinda gone off the deep end.

686
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,979
Mine, definitely not as much as Devan's has.

687
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:12,830
- Nope.

688
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,724
- It's my choice if I wanna keep 'em or switch 'em.

689
00:17:14,724 --> 00:17:16,755
So far, switching them has never been good,

690
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:18,544
but I'm gonna switch them right now.

691
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:19,392
- All right.

692
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:20,247
- I'm switching.

693
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,701
- [Both] Three, two, one.

694
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:22,534
- Yeah!

695
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:25,808
- [Collins] Pork rinds.

696
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:26,783
- Standing ovation.

697
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,075
Standing ovation.

698
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:29,979
- No. - Thank you so much, Collins.

699
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:33,021
Your service to me has been well recognized

700
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:34,274
and received. - What are?

701
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:35,132
- Thank you.

702
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:36,452
- Pickled in vinegar solution.

703
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:37,550
- Oh, I can smell it.

704
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,501
So, these are pumpkin spice soft caramels.

705
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,984
Oh, yes.

706
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:43,618
Mmm.

707
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:44,676
Wow. (gagging)

708
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:45,735
- Oh, I'm not looking forward to this.

709
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:47,221
This whole thing was going so good,

710
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,984
and then, now it's going, oh, my gosh, so badly.

711
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:51,191
What even is a pork rind?

712
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:52,389
- I don't know. - What is it?

713
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:53,222
I know it has something to do with pork,

714
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,352
but what is a rind?

715
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:55,489
You ready?

716
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:56,322
- Yep.

717
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:57,405
- Three, two.

718
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,905
Oh, and by the way, this was suggested by

719
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:01,099
the Instagram Keyper of the Week.

720
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:02,322
So, shout out to you and if you want to be

721
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:03,694
shouted out as the Instagram Keyper of the Week,

722
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:05,438
check the description down below to find out how.

723
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:06,271
All right.

724
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:09,457
- What?

725
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,688
- Bro, it's like so salty.

726
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:13,404
- As good or better than you expected?

727
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:14,237
- Worse.

728
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:15,070
- Worse.

729
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,522
- So much worse.

730
00:18:16,522 --> 00:18:17,528
Oh, so bad.

731
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:18,643
I don't even wanna add this.

732
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:21,360
- [Devan] You got the item.

733
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,026
- Now I gotta add a couple more pork rinds in.

734
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:24,250
That's it, that's it, that's it.

735
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,635
- See, I would say I would feel bad,

736
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:29,300
but I really don't because I've gotten so many bad ones.

737
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,545
- And now, the moment you've all been waiting for.

738
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,707
Time to blend it and then, drink it.

739
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:35,720
And guys, fun fact, we got better blenders

740
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,121
because we keep breaking our other ones.

741
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:38,685
So, these ones are supposed to be, like,

742
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,153
some crazy, heavy-duty blenders.

743
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,377
Well, hopefully they work and hopefully they can

744
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:43,132
blend up the madness we put inside of here.

745
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:43,983
- [Devan] Yeah, right?

746
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:45,168
- I told you guys, we're not messing around

747
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:47,102
with the blenders for this smoothie challenge.

748
00:18:47,102 --> 00:18:48,002
All right, just flip a switch, I guess.

749
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,201
- All right.

750
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:50,129
No, that didn't work.

751
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,027
- Nothing. - No, that didn't work.

752
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:53,360
(screaming)

753
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,866
I hear the cucumber.

754
00:18:57,866 --> 00:18:58,699
Oh, man!

755
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:01,353
- Let me smell. - It smells so bad.

756
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:02,392
(gagging)

757
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,537
Why doesn't the onion wanna go down?

758
00:19:04,537 --> 00:19:07,219
It's not going down at all.

759
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:08,192
Well, that was a fail.

760
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:09,025
- Bro. - Bro.

761
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:10,061
- Watch how this thing goes.

762
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:11,147
It goes, like, in a second.

763
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:11,980
You ready? - Yeah.

764
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,501
- [Both] Three, two, one.

765
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:14,863
(record scratching)

766
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:15,772
- What the heck? - What?

767
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:17,855
Press it up. - Oh, geeze!

768
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:20,352
Whoa!

769
00:19:20,352 --> 00:19:21,494
- Dude, I hear all the dog treats.

770
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,964
- It's the Spam and the treats, man.

771
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:23,885
The treats!

772
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:27,013
(blender grinding)

773
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:28,117
What the heck is in there?

774
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:29,598
Maybe it's, like, the paper from the cupcakes.

775
00:19:29,598 --> 00:19:30,621
- Oh, that's right.

776
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:32,766
(screaming)

777
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:33,599
Look at this, dude.

778
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,432
- [Collins] You ready?

779
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:35,299
I'm gonna pour a little bit in.

780
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,325
(screaming)

781
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:38,223
Oh, my gosh!

782
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:39,239
- [Devan] Oh, marshmallow!

783
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:40,098
- Marshmallow.

784
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:41,053
(laughing)

785
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:41,999
I think because of all the coffee,

786
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:43,049
yours is way more liquid-y than mine is.

787
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,286
- Yeah, mine's like a cube.

788
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:45,119
It's like a cube of ice.

789
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:45,970
- Mine looks like pudding.

790
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,482
All right, bro, we're about to drink this

791
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:48,751
and if you want to be shouted out in the next video,

792
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,481
comment down below, what are some foods

793
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,941
that we should put in a smoothie

794
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,787
in the next smoothie challenge that we do?

795
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:55,010
This is either gonna taste delicious or disgusting.

796
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,093
- [Both] Three, two, one.

797
00:20:02,123 --> 00:20:03,399
- Hmm.

798
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:04,232
Hmm.

799
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:05,378
(gagging)

800
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:07,355
(screaming)

801
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:08,203

Five, four, three,

806
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:15,516
two, one.

807
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:16,444
