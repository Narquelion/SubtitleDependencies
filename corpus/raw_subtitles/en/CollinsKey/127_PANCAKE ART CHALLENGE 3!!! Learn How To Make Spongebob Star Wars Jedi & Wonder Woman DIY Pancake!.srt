1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:02,261
- [Devan] Three, two, one.

2
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:04,448
- [Collins] That looks amazing, dude.

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:07,317
You challenged us to do the Pancake Art Challenge, again,

4
00:00:07,317 --> 00:00:09,550
and this time we're kicking off with Spongebob.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,706
- Dude, what are you doing?

6
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:11,542
- Gotta get the top off.

7
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:12,474
- That's like the most--

8
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:13,517
(glass crashing) (laughs)

9
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:14,871
Almost made a mark on the wall.

10
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:15,704
- Yay!

11
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:18,269
(object clatters)

12
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:21,186
- Everything you need is important.

13
00:00:22,894 --> 00:00:24,863
Please, do not bump me.

14
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:26,897
Be cautious of my elbow.

15
00:00:26,897 --> 00:00:28,118
- [Collins] My Spongebob's going to be huge.

16
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:29,302
- Bro, that's going to be massive.

17
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:31,686
The eyes are a very small part of Spongebob.

18
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:33,172
- Yeah, I didn't realize that.

19
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:34,005
- Oh, dude.

20
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:35,367
(screams)

21
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:36,919
- Jeeze. - What, what?

22
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,937
- (laughing) My thumb barely touched it, bro.

23
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:41,960
I thought I burned my thumb off.

24
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,774
Why did we put the bottles so close

25
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:45,336
to the super hot skillet?

26
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,706
(hip hop music)

27
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:49,524
Spongebob looks like he just got electrocuted.

28
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:51,154
Like a giant bolt of lightning hit him.

29
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:51,987
Oh man, no!

30
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:53,005
No, no, no, no, no.

31
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:54,295
Stop, stop, stop.

32
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:56,378
(laughs)

33
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,803
- It's like a club or like a spatula.

34
00:00:59,803 --> 00:01:01,568
- [Collins] He's got a massive forearm.

35
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:04,046
My Spongebob has no legs, it'll only have an upper body.

36
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:04,879
I apologize.

37
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,712
Okay, there we go.

38
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:08,804
Now my dude just needs to roast.

39
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:10,206
I'm very excited to see how both of these turned out.

40
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:12,608
And now, the moment of truth.

41
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:13,508
Devan, do you want to go first?

42
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:15,267
- Yeah, sure, I'll go first.

43
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,647
Hopefully it doesn't break.

44
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,199
- [Collins] Oh my gosh, it looks so--

45
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:19,792
He's got even the little legs.

46
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:21,191
- [Devan] This is always the hardest part.

47
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,024
Oh!

48
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,773
- Oh!

49
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:25,002
- [Devan] That actually looks pretty good.

50
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,192
- [Collins] That looks fantastic.

51
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:28,083
- You don't have any legs, what happened?

52
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,089
- Well-- (sighs)

53
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,035
Alright here we go, you ready?

54
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:30,868
Three, two, one.

55
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:32,607
No! - Oh, no!

56
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:34,081
- My hand.

57
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:35,236
- Both his arms broke off.

58
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:36,220
- Arms broke off.

59
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,326
Dude he got super burned.

60
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:38,847
Look at his eyeballs, bro.

61
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:41,030
His eyes are, like-- (screams)

62
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,347
Three, two, one.

63
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:45,092
(mumbles)

64
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:46,646
- And this is actually a battle, and you get to choose

65
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:47,974
who wins each round.

66
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,740
So, comment down below who won round number one.

67
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,173
Was it my beautiful--

68
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:53,942
It looks like a little mole that's supposed to be his nose.

69
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:55,001
- That's supposed to be his nose?

70
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:55,850
- That's his nose.

71
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,700
And then you got Devan's,

72
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,858
so comment down below who won.

73
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:59,548
We'll be eating these at the end of the video,

74
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:00,603
so stick around for that,

75
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,839
but right now it's on to round number two.

76
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,378
For this round, we are making a clown.

77
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:05,417
- Wait, what?

78
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,820
- Yeah, we're making a clown.

79
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,760
- No, bro.

80
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,008
Clowns are terrifying.

81
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:09,841
- What?

82
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,262
No, dude, clowns are like, they're all happy

83
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:12,497
and they juggle stuff, they got, like--

84
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:13,451
(record scratches)

85
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:14,390
- Have you seen a clown, bro?

86
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,272
- Well, let's do this, then.

87
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:16,498
Maybe you make your version of a clown, and I'll make

88
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:19,529
my version of a happy, just wonderful, tiptoeing clown.

89
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:20,469
- Okay.

90
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:22,680
- Tiptoeing in my clown shoes.

91
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,457
- Alright, I have one eye done.

92
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:25,316
It's a good start.

93
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:26,477
Whoa, I love his eyebrows.

94
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:27,457
Those are cool.

95
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:28,290
- Thank you.

96
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,798
He's got a massive nose.

97
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,504
Rudolph the red-nosed clown.

98
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:33,087
Oh, dude my guy looks so happy.

99
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,561
He's like, "Yeah I'm a clown, what's up?

100
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:37,047
I'm here for the birthday party".

101
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:39,606
- My eyes are looking like some eagle eyes over here.

102
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:40,663
Oh, it's looking good.

103
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:41,640
- Alright, here we go.

104
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,473
The final tooth.

105
00:02:42,473 --> 00:02:43,477
Yeah boy.

106
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:45,576
And actually, guys, right now comment down below,

107
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:47,338
what would you name my clown?

108
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:48,511
'Cause he looks super friendly.

109
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:49,485
He needs to have yellow teeth.

110
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:50,793
My clown don't brush his teeth no 'mo.

111
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:51,626
He has bad hygiene.

112
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:52,459
- That's not good.

113
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,015
- [Collins] One tooth is gonna be blue for no reason.

114
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:54,848
- Oh, dear.

115
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,439
- Okay, I gotta unclog my thing.

116
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,272
There we go.

117
00:02:57,272 --> 00:02:58,805
Oh!

118
00:02:58,805 --> 00:02:59,748
- [Devan] Oh!

119
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:01,379
- [Collins] They always have rosy cheeks, right?

120
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,584
So I gotta get some pink on my dude's cheeks.

121
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,465
(hip hop music)

122
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:08,297
- Ooh, this is turning out nice.

123
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:10,029
- See, I only have a very limited space right now to

124
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:11,352
make the rest of my clown body.

125
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:12,751
So, I gotta really make the most of it.

126
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:16,248
Dude, if my lower body stays in place, I will be so happy.

127
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:17,581
Three, two, one.

128
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:20,605
Yeah! - Oh!

129
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:21,438
Whoa!

130
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:22,926
- Dude, it's Bubbles the Clown.

131
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:25,000
Look it, he's so colorful and happy,

132
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,975
and he's got a blue tooth.

133
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:26,808
- Yeah?

134
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:27,711
- (laughs) He's got Bluetooth.

135
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,058
I'm gonna turn off the thing right now,

136
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:30,997
I'm gonna go get a snack and let me know when you're done.

137
00:03:30,997 --> 00:03:31,830
- Will do.

138
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,914
(circus music)

139
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:35,747
- Ah!

140
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,214
Why you bumping me bro?

141
00:03:37,214 --> 00:03:38,047
- Sorry.

142
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:40,739
(circus music)

143
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:41,572
- Nope.

144
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:45,059
- Probably not.

145
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:45,892
- What?

146
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,475
(circus music)

147
00:03:58,492 --> 00:04:00,171
- Yo dude, that looks crazy!

148
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,086
- I know, it's finally ready to flip.

149
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:03,642
- I cannot see what this thing's gonna look like,

150
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:04,475
so you got it?

151
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:05,308
- I got it, I got it.

152
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:06,141
- Wait, wait.

153
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:08,092
First we have a five second subscribe challenge for you.

154
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:10,062
Can you subscribe to this channel and turn on the channel

155
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:12,174
post notifications in five seconds?

156
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:13,007
Here we go, are you ready?

157
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:15,340
Five, four, three, two, one.

158
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,141
Done.

159
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:20,176
If you got it, comment down below "Keyper Squad" right now

160
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,280
and let's see what this pancake looks like.

161
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,347
- I think I got it, here we go.

162
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,694
- Three, two, one.

163
00:04:24,694 --> 00:04:25,527
- Oh! - Oh!

164
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:29,389
- Get it, get it, get it...

165
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:30,865
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

166
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:34,316
- Oh! - (laughs)

167
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,129
- That looks incredible!

168
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:38,157
What the heck?

169
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:39,274
(clapping) - Wow, alright.

170
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:40,618
- I don't even wanna do this anymore.

171
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:43,125
I just wanna like cover mine and be like R.I.P.

172
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,433
You get to vote which clown won this round,

173
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,266
whether you want the happy clown

174
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,662
or the flipping masterpiece.

175
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:52,059
- It did turn out better than I even expected it to.

176
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:52,892
- Mind blown.

177
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,432
And right now we are on to the next round.

178
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:57,414
For this round, we are doing Wonder Woman.

179
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:59,321
- Alright, time to get some detail.

180
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,154
- No, no, no

181
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:02,193
because we are doing a 90 second flash challenge.

182
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:04,400
You've got 90 seconds to make Wonder Woman.

183
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,527
- How am I supposed to-- - Go!

184
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:06,360
- What?

185
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,527
- My grill's not even on, oh gosh, okay cool.

186
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:10,326
(squeaky voices)

187
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:11,915
- How are we supposed to do this?

188
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:13,473
(squeaky voices)

189
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:15,726
- Dude, we only have like one minute left.

190
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:17,321
- Wait, really? - This is not enough time.

191
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,898
- I couldn't find the right color.

192
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:19,731
Here we go.

193
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:22,481
(squeaky voices)

194
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:29,055
(groans)

195
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:33,148
(overlapping chatter)

196
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:39,964
(squeaky voices)

197
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,797
Five, - What?

198
00:05:40,797 --> 00:05:41,630
- Four, - Now?

199
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,463
- Three, - Really?

200
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:45,056
- Two, one. Done, done!

201
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,432
What happened there?

202
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:47,669
That was insane,

203
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:50,083
like the pressure I felt on that was unprecedented.

204
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,333
- What is that?

205
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:53,313
- Yeah, she's definite not joining like

206
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:54,702
the Justice League looking like that.

207
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,420
Yours is just like abstract art.

208
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,253
- It's weird.

209
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:58,746
- And now the moment of truth,

210
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,060
time to see if we can flip it.

211
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,612
- Hold up, truth I think both of these were a fail.

212
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,239
- Aw man, this is not looking good.

213
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,300
She's getting wrinkled, she's getting a little bit old.

214
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,217
Oh my gosh!

215
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,248
Oh no, well that's great.

216
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:12,081
- Oh no!

217
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,067
- [Collins] She lost an eyeball.

218
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,654
- [Devan] Her torso, I didn't even flip it properly.

219
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:18,627
- I can't even put this onto a plate, so here's how it works

220
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,414
again you guys comment down below who won this round.

221
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,866
Alright, it's a toss up. - Yeah.

222
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,572
And this round is gonna be sweet

223
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:26,622
'cause we are making an ice cream cone

224
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:27,560
so no time restriction.

225
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,279
That looks like a pizza, that look like a Doritos chip.

226
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,073
- It kinda looks like the Illuminati,

227
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:33,883
you should just build the rest of the pyramid.

228
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:35,538
- Yeah, illuminati ice cream cone.

229
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:39,090
(suspenseful music)

230
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,412
My Doritos chip now looks like a giant malfunctioned waffle.

231
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:43,363
So here's what I'm gonna do guys,

232
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:45,942
I'm going for an artistic vision.

233
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:48,797
I'm making a super tall ice cream.

234
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,614
- Why does it have green spots on it?

235
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:52,653
- Well, because I wanted to be like flavored

236
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:53,731
so I gotta put it all over now.

237
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:54,851
Alright, so here we go.

238
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:56,914
There's three types of scoops: you got the long scoop,

239
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:58,346
the medium sized scoop which is next,

240
00:06:58,346 --> 00:06:59,588
and then you gotta little stump scoop.

241
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:00,524
- Scoop dabbed it.

242
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:01,357
Scoop dabbed it.

243
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:02,190
Scoop dabbed it.

244
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,867
(hip hop music)

245
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:06,196
This is my fourth time doing one of these things

246
00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:07,885
and I should learn my lesson at this point

247
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,429
that this challenge is not for Collins.

248
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,262
At all.

249
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,489
- It even looks like some sort of weird spacecraft.

250
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:15,060
- I was going for like a foot--

251
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,911
I'm tryna be abstract with it here

252
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:18,018
because this is not what it was supposed to be

253
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:18,851
in the beginning.

254
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:21,023
Right now, it's time to see what my flippin' ice cream

255
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,102
flippin' looks like as I flip it right now.

256
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:23,106
Let's flippin' do this.

257
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:24,673
- Flip it. - Flip it.

258
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:26,223
Three, two, one, flip.

259
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:27,194
Oh! (groans)

260
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:29,194
Dude, actually, yes yes.

261
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:33,374
- It looks like a cradle.

262
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:35,187
Bro, how do you mess up ice cream.

263
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:38,519
It's literally just a cone and like two blobs.

264
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,106
(melancholy music)

265
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:41,939
Alright, here we go.

266
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,770
Three, two, one, whoa!

267
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,195
Actually, bro, that actually looks pretty darn good.

268
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:48,170
Look at this.

269
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,003
Do you see this?

270
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:50,634
- Well, my-- (groans)

271
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:52,267
So comment down below right now

272
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:54,424
who do you think won this round?

273
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:57,472
This round, for this, we do Yoda.

274
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:58,815
- No, Yoda we do.

275
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:00,452
- Yoda we-- I'm not good at this.

276
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:03,453
So guys, for this round, we are doing Yoda from Star Wars.

277
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:04,286
- Let's go.

278
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:05,183
- And begin.

279
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:06,274
- Wait, I just said that.

280
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:07,107
Aw man.

281
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:11,339
- I think I got the whole table and the camera.

282
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:12,524
(groans)

283
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:15,191
(hip hop music)

284
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,076
You know that long hair that you can never control?

285
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:19,909
- [Devan] Yeah.

286
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:22,252
- That's why Yoda's got, he has one that has like--

287
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,085
(laughs)

288
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,047
(hip hop music)

289
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,907
I don't understand what you're doing but I'm sure at the end

290
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,792
I'm gonna be like, "Oh, that looks awesome!"

291
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:29,896
- [Devan] You have a red nose?

292
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:30,928
- [Collins] I have a red nose!

293
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,178
- You're thinking of a clown then, bro?

294
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,011
- Yeah boy!

295
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:34,976
Mine's very simplistic, as in I'm just gonna take

296
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:36,177
a whole bunch of green over here.

297
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:37,177
Oh! Come on!

298
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,728
Maybe the part of my strategy is

299
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,912
Devan will have no green left. (chuckles)

300
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:42,745
- What?

301
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:44,171
- Yoda's been holding his breath recently,

302
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:45,791
and his face has turned to purple.

303
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,248
So Yoda, you gotta breathe my man.

304
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:48,081
- Breathe, I will not.

305
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:48,914
- Breathe, I will not.

306
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:51,183
(hip hop music)

307
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:53,381
Actually, the ears look more like little arms.

308
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:55,044
I heard that the Hulk is gonna be in the new Thor movie,

309
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:57,034
and maybe this is how he'll look when he's in the movie.

310
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,012
I doubt it but I think it's his chance.

311
00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:01,679
(hip hop music)

312
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:07,089
Dude I am exhausted just watching you make this whole thing,

313
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,622
like this pancake is just next level.

314
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:12,122
Time to flip the Yoda pancake,

315
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:13,711
this is gonna look super interesting.

316
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,663
And we have a three second like challenge.

317
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:18,231
Basically, can you like this video in three seconds?

318
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:19,316
Right now, here we go.

319
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:21,731
Three, two, one, done.

320
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:22,715
Alright, here we go.

321
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:25,215
Three, two, one. Not my hairs.

322
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,793
No! Yoda went bald.

323
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,672
- [Devan] It looks like he's on a pogo stick.

324
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:34,140
- I can't believe he broke his spingly hair.

325
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,658
It was my favorite part of this entire thing.

326
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:39,294
Yeah-- what?

327
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:41,201
I don't have time for that Devan.

328
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:43,275
Alright, three, two, one.

329
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:45,237
That looks amazing dude!

330
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:46,199
You have him a bit burnt,

331
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:48,168
that's what happens when Yoda's in the sun for too long man,

332
00:09:48,168 --> 00:09:50,381
his face just gets--

333
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,751
It's incomprehensible to me how you do what you do.

334
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:56,512
This is called the Pumpkin 90 second flash challenge.

335
00:09:56,512 --> 00:10:00,268
Again, 90 seconds to put the pumpkin emoji, Devan.

336
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:01,824
Three, two, one, go.

337
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:03,675
(squeaky voices)

338
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:05,829
I forgot the Pam, hopefully doesn't burn the pumpkin.

339
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:09,388
(squeaky voices)

340
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:13,040
Dude, I'm not gonna get this at all!

341
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,790
(squeaky voices)

342
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,183
Ah, triangle illuminati.

343
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:22,536
Alright, here we go.

344
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:24,434
Dude, we have like forty seconds left.

345
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:27,184
(squeaky voices)

346
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,375
- I need orange, I need orange!

347
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,536
- No, dude that's mine!

348
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:34,869
- (screams)

349
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:37,228
- Ten seconds.

350
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:38,697
( squeaky voices)

351
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:40,363
- I'll help out. - Thank you.

352
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:42,035
Four, three, two, one, done.

353
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:42,868
Stop, stop, stop.

354
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:45,402
- Mine almost turned out good but it wasn't cooked enough,

355
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:46,599
so now I think it's just a mush.

356
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,648
- Man, bro, my heart is beating so fast

357
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,436
like that was a quick palpitation for it.

358
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:52,114
- I can't believe it, I can't believe it.

359
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:53,801
- And I think I smell it burning

360
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:55,845
because we forgot to use the Pam.

361
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:57,628
I've got a whole bunch of little bubblies at the top.

362
00:10:57,628 --> 00:10:59,869
The first ever simultaneous flip.

363
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,412
Three, two, one. (screams)

364
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,412
I caught it!

365
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:05,953
That was awesome.

366
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:09,987
Can we get an instant replay on that 'cause that was legit?

367
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:12,081
Mine got so burnt you can't even tell it's a pumpkin.

368
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:13,174
Everything looks the same color.

369
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,351
The green looks the same color as the brown, as the purple.

370
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:18,172
Like a basketball had gotten squished in lava.

371
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:19,873
- It's a deflated basketball.

372
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:21,422
- [Collins] Yours looks very, like, abstract.

373
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:22,255
- I messed it up.

374
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,284
- Sweet, mine's smoking.

375
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:24,375
I'll just turn this off.

376
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:28,032
So comment down below, who do you think won this round ?

377
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:30,702
And right now, we are headed into the finale.

378
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:32,797
- Ooh, the finale. I'm so ready.

379
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:34,138
- Let's do this, let's do a cross flip.

380
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:35,775
I'm gonna put my pancake over your pancake.

381
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:36,710
- Can I do a full flip?

382
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,987
Three, two, one.

383
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:39,235
(splats)

384
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:41,210
Oh, oh! I did a full flip!

385
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,765
- Aw, I missed.

386
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:45,872
As a tradition, we are doing self portraits of ourselves.

387
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,101
But this one's gonna be taken to the next level

388
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:51,265
because we're doing Snapchat filter versions of ourselves

389
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:52,442
so if you haven't added us already,

390
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:54,548
right over here is our names, go add us right now,

391
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,309
we do a whole bunch of crazy stuff behind the scenes.

392
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:58,347
And begin.

393
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:01,776
(hip hop music)

394
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:03,339
I got big ol' eyeballs

395
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:04,596
because that's what Snapchat filters do,

396
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:07,059
takes your eyes from here and is like "Whoa, hello!"

397
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,726
(hip hop music)

398
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:14,700
- Oh, I'm gonna do some red lips, some nice--

399
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,533
- Smoochy.

400
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,692
I'm looking like the orange eye bandit, man.

401
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:19,532
This is going pretty slow, I gotta speed up the process.

402
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,564
- Whoa! No, no, no.

403
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:22,928
You can't do this.

404
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:24,022
Oh my gosh!

405
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:27,037
- Yeah, yeah, don't try this at home.

406
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,509
- It looks like a marshmallow.

407
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:30,649
- [Collins] I know.

408
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,257
- [Devan] You got 'em.

409
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:33,674
You can stop now.

410
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,464
Whoa, you're gonna burn, you gotta stop,

411
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,728
you're gonna set off the smoke alarm, it's good.

412
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:41,847
- Perfect (coughs) perfect!

413
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:43,693
So I think I'm ready to flip mine now,

414
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:45,717
'cause that was a good little scorch.

415
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:47,550
Three, two, one, whoa!

416
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:50,108
It didn't get burned at all.

417
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:51,478
It doesn't look anything like me,

418
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:52,546
but it didn't get burned!

419
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,281
(hip hop music)

420
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,158
Alright, it is time.

421
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:57,787
If you make this flip happen, I will give you--

422
00:12:57,787 --> 00:12:58,714
- Give me what, the win?

423
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:01,374
- Yeah, I will automatically give you the win

424
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:03,811
if you make this flip happen where nothing breaks.

425
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:04,644
- I'll take it.

426
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:05,477
Alright, here we go.

427
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:07,206
Three, two, one.

428
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:11,139
Oh! (laughs) - (screams)

429
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:12,097
- I made it happen.

430
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:14,042
- How is he so good at this?

431
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,131
- This guy looks pretty funny.

432
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:16,619
I don't think it really looks like me.

433
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:18,812
- Dude, that looks just like your Snapchat filter.

434
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,321
So again, make sure you add us on Snapchat, right over here

435
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:23,301
because we are doing crazy stuff on there all the time.

436
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,657
And comment down below who won this round.

437
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:26,799
We are about to eat these pancakes,

438
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,717
but right now we have the final round.

439
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:31,463
For this one, we are doing a freestyle challenge.

440
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:33,610
Whatever you want to do, it's time to do it.

441
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,451
- (laughs) Okay. - (laughs)

442
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:38,351
Again, 90 seconds and that time starts now, go!

443
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,184
- Alright, here we go.

444
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,238
(squeaky voices)

445
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,463
Alright, got that done.

446
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:43,296
Okay, alright.

447
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:45,626
Next up, I gotta get the wheels.

448
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,885
(squeaky voices)

449
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:49,003
Dude, you're so focused.

450
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,004
- Yup, all I do.

451
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:51,983
I know exactly, I know what I want.

452
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:54,578
(squeaky voices)

453
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:56,337
Oh, only 40 seconds left.

454
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:57,561
Alright, here we go.

455
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,401
The masterpiece comes into play.

456
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:00,234
- Oh, no.

457
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:02,390
(squeaky voices)

458
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,889
- I hope you don't need these colors Devan.

459
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:06,639
(squeaky voices)

460
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,775
(timer dings)

461
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:16,670
Oh no, there we go.

462
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,464
Alright so mine's just roasting right now,

463
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:19,423
mine's gonna take a little bit.

464
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:20,918
What the heck did you draw?

465
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:22,700
- (laughs) It's supposed to be a skateboard.

466
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,889
I messed up the perspective in the very beginning,

467
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,996
all downhill from there so.

468
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,360
- And this is the skate park.

469
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,079
It was literally gonna compliment

470
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,672
whatever it is that you made.

471
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:32,928
So if you were like, "I made a skateboard.",

472
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,235
I'm like, "Well this is my skate park."

473
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:35,312
And if you made like a bird,

474
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:36,586
I'm like, "Well here's the sky."

475
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:37,747
- Alright, now here we go.

476
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,512
Three, two, one, oh no!

477
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,889
Alright, this is gonna be very hot.

478
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:43,308
- That's hot?

479
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,641
Speaking of hot!

480
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:50,499
Whoa, roasted!

481
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,832
- The heat's like going into the pancake.

482
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:53,665
- Oh, no.

483
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:54,916
- And making it like in flames.

484
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,547
- Oh, there you go, now--

485
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:59,171
Oh snap, that's smokin', that's smokin' real bad.

486
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:00,181
- (coughing)

487
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:01,307
- The fire alarm better not go off.

488
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:02,526
We still have a video to finish.

489
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,809
- If you don't want the fire alarm to go off,

490
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:04,921
stop using the blowtorch.

491
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,437
- I must cook my pancake.

492
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:09,374
(fire alarm blaring)

493
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:11,261
Ah, how do we turn this off?

494
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,178
Here we go.

495
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:16,177
You might wanna move back a little bit.

496
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:17,844
Three, two, one, no!

497
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:21,958
- It actually kinda looks pretty cool.

498
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,328
It looks like some sort of landscape.

499
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:25,064
- Now this is kind of a bummer because the main thing that

500
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:27,050
made this was the different colors, but as you can tell,

501
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,402
the colors have scorched.

502
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:32,319
I'd say if nothing else, you made a good emoji.

503
00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:34,438
(laughs) - This is a masterpiece.

504
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:35,937
But really, it's up to you guys.

505
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:36,874
If you want to prove Devan wrong,

506
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:39,388
and you think that this is just brilliant as I think it is,

507
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:42,529
comment down below who won this final round.

508
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,375
Now the moment you've all been waiting for,

509
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,253
time to taste all of these different pancakes.

510
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:49,019
So let's do this right now, pick up Yoda.

511
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,283
I guess you can eat your Yoda, I'll eat my Yoda.

512
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,262
- Okay, looks yuck.

513
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,484
- I'm gonna go for, I'm gonna direct in the middle here.

514
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:56,317
- Ready? Oh wait.

515
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:57,515
(crunching)

516
00:15:57,515 --> 00:16:00,924
- Dude, Yoda tastes great, I mean--

517
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:04,298
Next up, we have our beautiful self po-- Oh man.

518
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,711
I do not wanna eat this, I forgot I scorched this thing.

519
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:08,716
- Oh no, that's the downside of the blowtorch.

520
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:11,038
- Aw man, it's just charred, I don't wanna--

521
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,274
Okay, I'm gonna go for the mouth,

522
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:13,399
it's the least charred bit of it.

523
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,467
Here we go, three, two, one.

524
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:15,628
(crunching)

525
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:16,461
Ow!

526
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:17,711
- Mmm, so good.

527
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:20,846
- Ow! - No?

528
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,365
- It tastes like burnt-- (gags)

529
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:24,238
We're gonna do a speed round now,

530
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:25,184
and if you want to see another video,

531
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,099
click right over here.

532
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:29,266
(overlapping chatter)

533
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,243
Five seconds, you have one minute.

534
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,576
Five, four, three, two, one.

535
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,312
- Stop. - Alright.

536
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:42,321
(overlapping chatter)

537
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:43,429
- Taste that. - Okay.

538
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:46,895
- It's Spongebob. - I'm gonna eat his mouth.

539
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:49,197
