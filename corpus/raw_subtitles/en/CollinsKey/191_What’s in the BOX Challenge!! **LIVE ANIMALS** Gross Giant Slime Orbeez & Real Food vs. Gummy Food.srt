1
00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:01,960
- Oh, my gosh!

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,304
Oh, what is that?

3
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:04,706
I hope I'm not hurting it,

4
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:05,709
I'm pinching it really hard.

5
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:08,488
(screaming)

6
00:00:08,488 --> 00:00:10,658
You challenged us to do the what's in the box challenge.

7
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:12,063
Today, I'm here with Coyote Peterson

8
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:13,265
from Brave Wilderness.

9
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:14,098
- What's going on, guys?

10
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:16,203
- And we're about to stick our hands in this box

11
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:18,335
and guess what you wanted us to touch.

12
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:19,168
This is gonna be crazy.

13
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:20,001
All right, here we go.

14
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:20,834
Three--

15
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:21,667
Oh, hold on

16
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:22,950
Two, one, go.

17
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,062
(screaming) Geeze, what is that?

18
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:24,895
What is that?

19
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:26,287
I'm gonna touch it.

20
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:27,418
Oh, geeze.

21
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:28,535
- Oh, it's on my finger!

22
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:30,156
(screaming)

23
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:31,893
- Whoa, what on earth?

24
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:32,748
(sniffing)

25
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:34,187
It smells so weird!

26
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:35,020
(sniffing)

27
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,320
- Oh, my gosh, that does not smell good

28
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,524
This feels like toilet paper

29
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:38,515
and I think I know what's on it.

30
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:39,793
- Oh, no! - Oh!

31
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:40,627
I do not agree to be a part of this!

32
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:42,732
- Oh, no, is this like a poopy diaper?

33
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:44,893
Yo, that is disgusting!

34
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:45,745
What do you think it is?

35
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,114
- I mean, I wanna guess that it's a poopy diaper,

36
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,924
but there's not way that--

37
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,112
- [Collins] That's your final guess?

38
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:51,945
Oh, my!

39
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,631
It's a diaper, bro. - It is not!

40
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:56,384
- It is literally a diaper, bro!

41
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:57,808
- Oh, no!

42
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:58,936
- What the heck?

43
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:01,277
It smells kinda weird, like funky,

44
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:02,888
like it's got a weird tang and odor to it, man.

45
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:04,316
- It's not good.

46
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:05,395
Here, try some. (screaming)

47
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:07,592
It's the look that really makes you gag.

48
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:09,249
- No, look, 'cuz it looks way too realistic, bro.

49
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,417
It looks way too realistic.

50
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:12,200
- I think it's caramel and peanut butter, though.

51
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,033
- That's pretty gross.

52
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:14,981
Guys, Coyote won the very first round

53
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:16,591
and we're gonna be doing a whole bunch of rounds

54
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:17,770
and whoever wins the most,

55
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,253
apparently they get to give a punishment to the loser.

56
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:21,675
So, what is this punishment gonna be?

57
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:24,467
- Well, Collins, I just so happen to have with me

58
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:26,309
some habanero peppers.

59
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:27,550
- Oh, no.

60
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,897
- One of the hottest peppers in the world.

61
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:31,653
So, if you don't win all the challenges,

62
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:35,198
you have to eat one or maybe the entire box of peppers,

63
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:36,872
depending on how brave you feel.

64
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,249
- All right, game is on.

65
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:39,202
We're going for it.

66
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:41,218
So, I think, Coyote, it's your turn right now.

67
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:42,541
You've got the next item ready to go,

68
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,571
so I'm gonna turn around

69
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:44,799
and I guess, let's do it.

70
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,129
- Let's put something in that box.

71
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:47,057
All right, guys.

72
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:48,866
Well, my first item for Collins to guess

73
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:50,627
is now inside of the box.

74
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:52,447
So, if you're ready--

75
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:53,280
- Can I turn around?

76
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,128
- Turn around, let's see if you can figure out what it is.

77
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:56,795
- Okay. - Whoa, wait!

78
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:59,987
You gotta remember that I sometimes

79
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,463
have tricks up my sleeves.

80
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:02,444
- Oh, no.

81
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:03,376
- So, hold on a second.

82
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:04,430
Hold on.

83
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,608
Oh, stay, buddy.

84
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:07,418
Stay. - What is it?

85
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,060
- Very slowly, place your hands inside of the box.

86
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,981
- Oh, my gosh. - Do not squeeze,

87
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:13,706
just gently feel with the tips of your fingers.

88
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:15,218
- I'm so nervous, hold up.

89
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,903
- Come on, it's gonna get out of the box.

90
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:17,736
- It's gonna get out?

91
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:18,581
Okay, okay, oh, my gosh.

92
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:19,708
- [Coyote] Go, go, go, go, go.

93
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:20,541
(screaming)

94
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,374
- What is that?

95
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,833
(screaming)

96
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,727
I hope I'm not hurting it.

97
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,815
I'm pinching it really hard.

98
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:25,758
- Oh, it doesn't look good.

99
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:26,676
- I'm pinching it.

100
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:27,829
It stayed pinched, bro.

101
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,663
(screaming)

102
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:29,837
What is that?

103
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:32,082
- You know I've worked with a lot of large worms and snakes.

104
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:32,915
- Oh, god.

105
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:35,503
Okay, I'm going with both hands.

106
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:36,731
(screaming)

107
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:37,564
Oh, my gosh.

108
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:38,397
It was sharp.

109
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:39,230
- It's not sharp.

110
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,063
- Dude, there was an edge.

111
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:40,896
I felt and edge.

112
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:41,729
- Was it a tooth?

113
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:42,562
- That's what it felt like.

114
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,499
- It could have been a claw.

115
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:44,651
- Oh, dude, I'm tripping.

116
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:45,611
I'm tripping right now.

117
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:47,444
Oh, my gosh.

118
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:48,997
- Now, just go with both hands in there

119
00:02:48,997 --> 00:02:49,830
and pull it out.

120
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,163
(screaming)

121
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:57,974
Do you have any idea what it possibly is?

122
00:02:57,974 --> 00:02:59,117
- Dude. - I'll give you a hint.

123
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:00,605
It's not really alive.

124
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,438
- Boing

125
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:02,459
(screaming)

126
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:03,617
I broke it in half.

127
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,680
It juiced on me.

128
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,056
Bro, I can't. - Do you give up?

129
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:07,318
- I have literally no idea.

130
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:08,611
- You haven't even said anything yet.

131
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:10,827
- I literally have no idea what it is.

132
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:11,660
- I've got an idea.

133
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,851
Close your eyes. - Oh, my gosh.

134
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,712
- And take a piece out and just bite it

135
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:15,937
and see if you can guess based on taste.

136
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:18,575
It's okay, it's not moving now.

137
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:20,180
Just take a big bite out of it.

138
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,557
- It's spiky on that end.

139
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:23,216
It's not gonna bite me?

140
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:24,049
It tastes salty.

141
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:25,028
It's super salty.

142
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:25,971
Oh, my gosh, it's so salty.

143
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:28,079
- Oh, man, you're a brave individual.

144
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,367
Any idea yet?

145
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:30,438
- Oh, it's like a hot dog.

146
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:31,271
A sausage.

147
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:35,513
- It's kinda something between a worm and a snake.

148
00:03:35,513 --> 00:03:37,120
- That was the worst.

149
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,050
Terrifying.

150
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,838
A ton of you guys suggested this one right here.

151
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:41,558
I don't think he's gonna know what it is.

152
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:43,607
We'll have to see 'cuz it's a little bit dangerous,

153
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:44,968
which, Coyote is not afraid of danger,

154
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:46,894
but, hopefully, they stay in there

155
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:47,727
and they don't move.

156
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,952
So, you guys, if you see it moving,

157
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:49,870
make sure nothing happens.

158
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,393
All right, so, Coyote, you can turn around.

159
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:52,842
I would suggest using one hand for this

160
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:54,396
just in case something goes on.

161
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:56,576
- One of them usually is getting bitten by things.

162
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:59,599
Now, generally, I always look where my hands are going

163
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,795
because that's how you accidentally get bitten by stuff.

164
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:03,558
- Yeah, so, hopefully that doesn't happen on this one.

165
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:05,308
So, put your hand in.

166
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:08,651
- Oh.

167
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:09,657
- I touched something there.

168
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:10,820
- I don't know why I'm getting scared.

169
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,175
- It's like a bowl.

170
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:13,354
Oh, there's something in the bowl.

171
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,606
There's something in the bowl!

172
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:15,439
- Yes.

173
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,874
- Ooh, it's like jelly-ish.

174
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:18,189
Like little eggs.

175
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:19,118
It's kinda like little eggs.

176
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:20,072
Ooh, it's soft.

177
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:21,437
I'm gonna squeeze one and see what happens.

178
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:22,976
Oh, it shot out of my hand.

179
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,317
Oh, it's lima beans

180
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:26,739
Are they gummy lima beans?

181
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:28,133
Oh, no, I know what it is.

182
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,605
You guys took those Jelly Belly jellybeans

183
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,065
and sucked all the outside off of them

184
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:33,458
and just left the inside, right?

185
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,142
Let's see if I can do this.

186
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,680
It went all over the place.

187
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,004
(laughing)

188
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,480
- They're Orbeez.

189
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,523
- What's an Orbee?

190
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:41,810
You can't do this.

191
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,902
- No, no, no, no, no!

192
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:45,028
- No, don't do that?

193
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:46,185
- No, do not eat the Orbeez.

194
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,151
- I thought they were candies.

195
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,008
I love how they bounce, though.

196
00:04:48,008 --> 00:04:48,841
- Yo, those are--

197
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:49,674
Yeah, they're very--

198
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:50,674
Oh, my gosh.

199
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,333
- Whoa! (maniacal laughing)

200
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,622
- Right now, we're on the next one

201
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:57,817
and I'm nervous to see what you've got in store for me

202
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:59,291
'cuz this guy, he might be like a tarantula.

203
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,435
- I'm gonna get you on this one, buddy.

204
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:01,268
- Oh, man

205
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,138
- As long as I don't slip on these Orbeez.

206
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:03,971
- Hold on, one second.

207
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:04,936
I gotta make sure it's--

208
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:05,769
Oh, geeze.

209
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:06,626
Hold on, I gotta make sure it's like--

210
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,290
Okay, one second.

211
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,123
Okay.

212
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:09,956
All right, so, on this one now,

213
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:10,891
you get to guess what's inside.

214
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:11,724
I'm just gonna let you know on this one,

215
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:12,669
you wanna be a little careful.

216
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:13,746
Just go for it.

217
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,472
- Oh, that makes me feel confident.

218
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:16,305
Just go for it.

219
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:17,218
I'm gonna go left handed on this one.

220
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:18,198
- Oh, man.

221
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,041
Oh, wait a second!

222
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:19,874
Get your hand out, hold on.

223
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:20,707
Wait, wait, wait.

224
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:21,540
Okay, you have to turn around again.

225
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,373
Okay. - It sounds like

226
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:23,305
you're struggling over there, man.

227
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:24,138
- Yeah. - Are you sure

228
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:24,971
this is a good idea?

229
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:25,804
I don't even feel anything yet.

230
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:28,099
- Oh, it's kinda being sneaky right now.

231
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:28,932
(screaming)

232
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:30,692
- It's in the back corner!

233
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:31,525
Ooh.

234
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,078
Oh, no.

235
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:34,245
It's not poop again, is it?

236
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:35,101
(laughing)

237
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,666
Oh, is this old cheese?

238
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,655
Rotting cheese?

239
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:38,981
Rotting cream cheese.

240
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:39,986
- Not quite rotten, but yeah, it's cream cheese.

241
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:42,645
- Is it right? - Yeah, you got it.

242
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:44,299
He just whips out a chunk of it.

243
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:45,859
- Oh, I do not like cream cheese!

244
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:47,434
Okay, now, before you put your hands in there,

245
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,780
I do want to make you aware that here in the Sonoran desert

246
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,658
of Arizona, the only scorpion species that's capable

247
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:55,073
of hanging upside down, which is called the bark scorpion,

248
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,761
is right in this area.

249
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:58,212
Now, the thing inside of this box

250
00:05:58,212 --> 00:06:00,271
may also be capable of hanging upside down.

251
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:03,257
I'm just warning you in advance, it may be a scorpion,

252
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:04,518
it may not be a scorpion.

253
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:05,706
So, go ahead and put your hands inside the box

254
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:07,082
and let's see what happens.

255
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:07,990
Oh, wait a second.

256
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,196
Whoa. - You're kidding me.

257
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:11,087
- Oh, no, it's still in there.

258
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:11,920
I thought it was out here.

259
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,610
- I don't even wanna do this anymore.

260
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,148
(screaming)

261
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:16,029
Okay, that's it.

262
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:16,958
That's nothing.

263
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,272
- You didn't squish it, did you?

264
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:20,343
Just kinda explore around on the inside there.

265
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:21,249
There you go.

266
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:22,700
Be brave about it.

267
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,815
Getting warmer.

268
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:25,081
- I feel like you're trying to, like--

269
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,020
I don't know where it's at.

270
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,853
Trying to hear it.

271
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:27,794
Hello, are you in there?

272
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:30,464
- A lot of times, these things are ambush predators, right?

273
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:32,145
Which means they sit and wait for their prey

274
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:34,413
to come to them, figure that's probably a great thing

275
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,463
for this sort of an experiment.

276
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,768
If it just waits in the box,

277
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:39,497
maybe one of the corners of the box?

278
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:40,330
- Are you sure it's even in there?

279
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,256
- Oh, yeah, it's in there.

280
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:43,339
Whoa, take your hand out.

281
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:45,963
No sudden movements.

282
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:47,052
That's how you're gonna get attacked.

283
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:48,051
- Bro, you said take your hand out.

284
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,188
I'm like, it's out, fam. - Here's what I'm gonna do.

285
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:52,112
- It's gone. - Take a deep breath.

286
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,033
- Okay. - Don't look,

287
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,210
just turn in that direction. - Okay.

288
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,709
- I'm gonna place it in an area.

289
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,445
Hold on. - Place it?

290
00:06:57,445 --> 00:06:58,358
- Ooh, okay.

291
00:06:58,358 --> 00:06:59,326
- What the heck? Ow!

292
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:00,974
I smacked my knee, you scared me so bad.

293
00:07:00,974 --> 00:07:01,807
- [Coyote] Go, go, go, go, go.

294
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:02,640
It's gonna move.

295
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,558
Forward, forward, forward.

296
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:05,150
(screaming) Oh, my gosh!

297
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,637
- Put your hand flat, straight down,

298
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:07,700
and just keep it there.

299
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,157
Keep it there, keep it there, keep it there.

300
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:10,887
If you move-- - Wait a minute.

301
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:12,636
What in the--

302
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:14,042
What in the--

303
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,210
I was about to say sticky hand, but this--

304
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,114
- What is it?

305
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:17,947
- Yee.

306
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:20,676
- But it's not a scorpion

307
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:22,116
and you didn't get stung,

308
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:24,357
so we live for the next challenge.

309
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:25,275
(toy gun sound)

310
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:27,187
- So, I hate to say this, but on this one, here, Coyote,

311
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:28,601
be careful of the tail.

312
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:29,951
That's all I'm gonna say.

313
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:33,112
- I'm Coyote Peterson and I'm about to enter the strike zone

314
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:35,519
with I don't even know what's in this box.

315
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,996
Okay, are we ready?

316
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:37,901
Are you ready?

317
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:38,734
- Here we go.

318
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,401
- One, two, oh, boy.

319
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:44,048
- Go for it. - Three.

320
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,156
- Wait, first, actually, I've got a challenge for you.

321
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:48,027
I wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel,

322
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,061
turn on the channel post notifications,

323
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,490
and give this video a thumbs up in seven seconds.

324
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,930
Okay, let's see if you can do this right now, you ready?

325
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,847
Seven, six, five, four,

326
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:59,011
three, two, one, done.

327
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:01,333
If you can do that, comment down below,

328
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,648
Keyper Squad, right now,

329
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,248
and Coyote, I was trying to buy you a little bit of time

330
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:05,834
because it's looking like it's a little more settled

331
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,211
down now, so it's good for you to go.

332
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:09,667
- You know, that little pause for that call out,

333
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:12,195
made it even harder now to put my hand inside the box

334
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:13,858
'cuz the nerves have only built.

335
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,495
Thanks, Collins, I appreciate that.

336
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,458
- I got you. - Here we go, guys.

337
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,679
I'm just going for it. Ready? - All right, go.

338
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,145
(screaming)

339
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:21,978
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.

340
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:22,811
- It moved. - It moved

341
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,107
- It moved. - It moved.

342
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:25,240
- Oh, my leg is shaking.

343
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,223
I'm just gonna take this one slow.

344
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:29,212
I was gonna go straight for it, but--

345
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:30,476
If I make a little movement like that,

346
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,423
maybe, if it's alive, it'll strike.

347
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:33,673
Oh, It's gushy!

348
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:36,139
I don't know what that is.

349
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,818
- [Collins] You, straight up, if you guess what this is

350
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:38,857
you will be like a ninja.

351
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:40,332
- Oh, there's something solid inside of it.

352
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:42,501
Oh, it does feel like it has some bones, though.

353
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,227
You did not pick something off the road outside?

354
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,370
- Yo, when I was picking this one out,

355
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,240
I was like there is no way he's gonna guess it.

356
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,563
- I think it's prehistoric in nature.

357
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,126
I can feel the spikes on top of it.

358
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:54,223
It might be related to a stegosaur.

359
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:56,913
- I don't even know what that is.

360
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:57,746
(fake screaming)

361
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,362
- Oh, something is sharp on it.

362
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:00,847
Is this a dinosaur?

363
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:02,458
- Yes.

364
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,569
- [Coyote] Wait a second, is that a skeleton inside of it?

365
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:05,660
- Yep, there you go.

366
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,497
- It's a dinosaur with a skeleton inside of it.

367
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:08,866
- Dude, look how awesome this thing is, bro.

368
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:09,699
- What!

369
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,615
- You can like fully remove the skeleton.

370
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:13,630
- Sweet, now it's just a finger puppet.

371
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,463
Look at that.

372
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:16,454
I love this game.

373
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:18,254
Oh, Collins! - Yes?

374
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:20,820
- I got another treat for you inside this box, buddy.

375
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,710
Now, don't look.

376
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,645
I'll give you guys a little bit of animal facts.

377
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:26,054
One of the most dangerous jellyfish in the world

378
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:27,442
is called the Box Jellyfish,

379
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,303
so why wouldn't you bring a Box Jellyfish

380
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,429
and put it inside the box

381
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:31,869
when you're guessing what's inside the box?

382
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:32,759
- 'Cuz it's dangerous.

383
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,927
- I'm not gonna say if there is or isn't

384
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:35,605
a Box Jellyfish inside of this box,

385
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,452
you're just gonna have to reach your hand inside of there

386
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,661
and tell us whether or not it is a Box Jellyfish.

387
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,497
Now, I will warn you, if it is,

388
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,786
we may have to end the shoot and go to the hospital.

389
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,720
So, without further ado, put your hand inside the box

390
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,593
and let's see what's in there. - Oh, my gosh.

391
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:47,473
I'm not excited about this.

392
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:48,886
- Hi, buddy.

393
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,173
Okay, you don't look happy.

394
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,347
Yeah, well that's not gonna hurt you at all.

395
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:53,700
That's just a bowl.

396
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,211
(screaming) Oh, there you go.

397
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,597
You know what, have you ever played those games

398
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,559
where you put in 50 cents and it's got the grappling claw

399
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,392
that comes down? - Yeah, yeah.

400
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:00,853
- And you grab the toy and you can never get the toy.

401
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:02,093
Today, you're the grappling claw

402
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:03,135
and you're gonna get the toy.

403
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,137
Only, that's not a toy,

404
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,628
so put your hand in there like a grappling thing,

405
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:07,749
I'll tell you when you're close and

406
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:11,249
there you go. (screaming)

407
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:15,924
Yeah, that' right.

408
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:17,219
What do you think it is?

409
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:18,417
I see you're very excited.

410
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,709
- I wouldn't use the word excited.

411
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:20,982
- Give me one guess.

412
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:22,151
What does it feel like?

413
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:23,589
A little bit like a jellyfish, right?

414
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,908
- It's like the most runny mashed potatoes

415
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:28,225
I've ever had, like, felt.

416
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:29,455
What is this thing?

417
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:30,400
- Oh, I don't know.

418
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,442
I don't know what that is. - It's almost like

419
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:32,275
yogurt and peaches.

420
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:34,280
Is it like a peach baby food?

421
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,502
- Um, babies could technically eat it,

422
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,492
if you want a hint.

423
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:38,587
Go on, you got this.

424
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:39,787
You need a point. - I do.

425
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:40,641
Is it like--

426
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,685
It can't be Jello.

427
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:42,827
- Oh, it could be.

428
00:10:42,827 --> 00:10:44,129
- Jello, peach, peach Jello?

429
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,194
- Oh!

430
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,054
Taste it and tell us.

431
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:48,215
- Yeah, it's like Jello.

432
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,048
- Oh, yeah.

433
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,008
That's a point. - That was close.

434
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:51,463
That was disgusting.

435
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:52,626
All right, so you can turn around

436
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:55,901
and this may be the grossest item yet.

437
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:56,782
- Why?

438
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:57,699
Why me?

439
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,337
- On this one, there's really no approach to it,

440
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:00,354
it's just gross.

441
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:01,345
(grunting)

442
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,562
- Oh, it's wet and slimy.

443
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,395
- I know, right?

444
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:05,228
- Is that a cow tongue?

445
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,061
- No, what?

446
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:07,552
No! - Oh, no!

447
00:11:07,552 --> 00:11:08,676
Oh, it's an ear!

448
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:09,509
Is it an ear? - You got it.

449
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:10,437
That was quick.

450
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,686
You got it, don't lick it, bro.

451
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:13,029
It probably has all chemicals, okay.

452
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:13,879
Yo, what's up, dude?

453
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,807
- Yeah, is there only one in here?

454
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:15,640
- I can't hear you.

455
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,473
I can't hear you.

456
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:17,831
Coyote's kinda dominating right now,

457
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:19,307
but, hopefully, this next round I'll be able

458
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:20,345
to take it back.

459
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:24,290
- Oh, it's got danger written all over it.

460
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,315
Now, this one is not potentially an animal.

461
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:28,271
- Great. - But, it can

462
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,367
possibly hurt your ears, your nose, and your eyes.

463
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:32,843
Yeah, keep going.

464
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:33,963
Just a hair further.

465
00:11:33,963 --> 00:11:35,578
- It's a can of sorts.

466
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,509
There's like a button at the top of it.

467
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:38,709
Should I press it? - I don't know.

468
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,209
(fart sounds)

469
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:45,123
(screaming)

470
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:46,297
Why would you smell it? - Holy cow!

471
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:47,429
It smells so bad.

472
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:48,519
It smells like a fart can.

473
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,858
- This is the big boy.

474
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:51,946
(screaming)

475
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:53,769
- I got the point on that one. - That is a point for you.

476
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:54,649
- Sweet!

477
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:55,751
All right, on to the next round.

478
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:57,019
This thing is just terrible.

479
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,096
(shouting)

480
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,167
All right, this one here was suggested

481
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,717
by the Instagram Keyper of the Week,

482
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:01,943
so if you want to be featured as the Instagram

483
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,085
Keyper of the week,

484
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:04,608
check the description down below to find out how,

485
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:05,725
but right now, Coyote, it's all you.

486
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,171
And for this one, the best suggestion I would have

487
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:09,826
is just both hands in at the same time

488
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:11,707
just grab and tear.

489
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:14,540
- Just go for it? - Just go for it.

490
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:18,733
- It's plastic and rubbery.

491
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,208
Oh, what is this?

492
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,203
Is it Play-Doh?

493
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:23,036
- Nope!

494
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:24,520
- It feels like liver. - He's got the whole box.

495
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,473
He's like yee.

496
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:27,534
Literally like any other YouTuber would know what this is.

497
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:28,452
- Is it slime?

498
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:29,817
- Yay!

499
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,006
- Like, bubblegum slime?

500
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:32,700
- You shouldn't eat it, dude!

501
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,317
Right now, guys, we're onto the next round.

502
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:35,354
I'm making a comeback right now.

503
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,345
It's a comeback, baby

504
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:37,178
Don't you ever for--

505
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:38,011
Oh, geeze.

506
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:39,744
Yeah, there we go onto the next round and let's go.

507
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,322
- Now, on my channel, people often want to know,

508
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:43,283
Coyote, when are you gonna catch Bigfoot?

509
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:44,487
I don't think I'm ever gonna catch him,

510
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:45,776
but if you're ready, turn around,

511
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:47,078
find out if Bigfoot's in the box.

512
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:47,911
- What?

513
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:51,021
- Ooh, I would go kinda further toward the front of the box,

514
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,873
just for safety sake.

515
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,836
Just a little more forward.

516
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,339
Yeah, there you go.

517
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:57,416
- Was that the box or was that it?

518
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,249
- That was it.

519
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:00,332
- This is the most terrifying thing of all time

520
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:01,917
- It's really close. - Oh, my god!

521
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:02,896
There's hairs on it.

522
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,091
- [Coyote] Yeah, this thing is--

523
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:05,291
It appears to be alive.

524
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,586
(screaming)

525
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,430
- [Collins] Where'd it go?

526
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,844
I feel it moving out of the box.

527
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:10,290
- No, nope, it's still right in the middle

528
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,684
Maybe if you just kinda gently put your hand on top of it

529
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:14,644
like you did the Box Jellyfish Jello.

530
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:15,811
There you go.

531
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,074
There you go. (screaming)

532
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:18,091
- Holy cow, okay.

533
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:21,203
(screaming) Oh, my gosh

534
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:22,491
- I did not do that.

535
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:23,696
- Oh, my gosh.

536
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,442
Okay. - Now, often times

537
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:27,330
when I catch animals, usually the best approach

538
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,592
is to just commit.

539
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:31,246
If you kinda just dance around it, it may take a bite,

540
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:32,695
so I would just go ahead and reach around there and--

541
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:33,974
(screaming)

542
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:34,820
Hold it right there.

543
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,085
- I got it in my hand.

544
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:37,583
- Do not shake the box, Collins.

545
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,947
Do not shake the box.

546
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:39,927
- It wasn't alive, right?

547
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:41,875
- I don't know, 'cuz it looked alive.

548
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,782
- Definitely not anymore, the way that I grabbed it.

549
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:44,787
- You squeezed it?

550
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:46,222
Just really slowly try to guess.

551
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:47,272
Kinda open up your hand a little bit

552
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:48,548
so the audience can see what it is.

553
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:49,528
- It's kinda fuzzy.

554
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,425
- Guess, guess, guess before it gets away.

555
00:13:51,425 --> 00:13:52,552
- Why is it gonna--

556
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:54,006
I don't wanna touch it anymore.

557
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:55,518
- Try to guess what it is when it's right there.

558
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:56,880
- What the heck is that?

559
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,517
- He can't even get it when it's right on there.

560
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:00,517
- What the heck is that?

561
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:02,450
- Sorry.

562
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,283
- I almost had a heart att--

563
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:04,251
Whoa, what is this?

564
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:05,304
- It's Bigfoot's mustache.

565
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,137
See that.

566
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,505
(laughing)

567
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:08,460
- That's so funny.

568
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,310
- Now, you look like me. - Hey, guys,

569
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,381
I'm Coyote Peterson and welcome to Brave Wilderness.

570
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:12,845
- There you go. - Today, I'm gonna get stung.

571
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,306
- You know what, I don't know if you can

572
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:15,850
make a comeback here, and if you don't,

573
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,956
I think you should wear the Bigfoot mustache

574
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:19,556
while eating a habanero pepper.

575
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:20,943
- New punishment, you have to eat--

576
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,194
Oh, my gosh. - You gotta wear

577
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,993
the Bigfoot mustache while you eat the pepper.

578
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,547
- Game on, let's go.

579
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,404
I've seen the video of yours where you literally

580
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:29,113
had leeches on your arm.

581
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:29,986
- Yes.

582
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:31,165
- I thought, if you've already done that,

583
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,334
then this is gonna be no issue

584
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,158
to kinda do something similar to that again.

585
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:37,491
- [Coyote] All right, here we go, ready?

586
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,621
- [Collins] Oh, there you go.

587
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:41,458
- It's a bowl!

588
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,652
- It is a bowl. - It's a bowl

589
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:43,752
Got it, point!

590
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:44,696
- Uh uh, no, no, no.

591
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:45,779
- [Coyote] Go back inside the bowl, here we go.

592
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,196
- [Collins] Inside the bowl.

593
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:48,589
- Ooh, no, no, no.

594
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:49,678
Are those bird eggs?

595
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:50,580
Oh, no.

596
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,181
Not pickled eggs? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

597
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:53,931
- Is it a lizard egg?

598
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:55,609
Yeah, it's a lizard--

599
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:56,569
(screaming)

600
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:57,559
No, olives!

601
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,566
Olives!

602
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,042
I don't like olives!

603
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:00,987
- Well, you got it.

604
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:01,820
(shouting)

605
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,834
- All right. - Let's see what comes out.

606
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:03,909
Oh, is that a lizard? - What is it?

607
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:04,742
- No, that's-- - That's like

608
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:06,097
a piece of garlic. - Ew.

609
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:07,514
Watch this, guys.

610
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:10,516
That'll get him good.

611
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:12,766
Now, I read on the internet

612
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,193
you are afraid of slugs.

613
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:16,716
So, I said to myself, you know what

614
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:17,907
I'm not gonna bring today?

615
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:18,949
Any slugs. - Great.

616
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:20,287
- 'Cuz that wouldn't be cool.

617
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,213
- That would not be cool.

618
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,527
- But, instead, I found something

619
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:23,965
that's really close to a slug,

620
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,651
so that's just the only hint that you're gonna get.

621
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:27,216
- Okay. - And, at this point,

622
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:28,899
I think you do need to score some points,

623
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:29,916
so do your best.

624
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:30,980
Yeah, both hands.

625
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,813
There's two of them in there,

626
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,526
so you might as well use both hands.

627
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:35,250
One of them seems to be a little angry, so--

628
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,083
- What?

629
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,036
- [Coyote] Oh, there you go.

630
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:37,953
- What the heck is that?

631
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:39,672
- Oh, boy, he's going for it.

632
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,796
You're getting braver as this is going on, you know that?

633
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,236
Take one and squish it in your hand.

634
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:44,574
Give it a good old squeeze.

635
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:46,138
- [Collins] Is it a turd?

636
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:48,109
- I mean, some may consider it as such.

637
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:49,262
- It feels just like a turd.

638
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:51,109
Oh, it's a Twinkie.

639
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:52,854
- You know, Twinkies say good forever,

640
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:54,039
so that means this is still good.

641
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,872
Go ahead, eat it.

642
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:55,806
Break a piece off. - Okay.

643
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,620
- Oh, man, that one's stale.

644
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,418
- Bro, this is, like, super dry.

645
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,781
Okay, so you can turn around

646
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:02,095
and you gotta guess what's inside.

647
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,060
I'm not gonna give you any hints,

648
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,251
I'm not gonna set it up in any way,

649
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:05,852
just reach inside and go for it.

650
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:08,008
- I'm gonna be bold, go both hands.

651
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,484
I like to check the edges--

652
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:10,460
Oh, what's this?

653
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,098
Oh, some residue from something left over from before

654
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:13,088
(laughing)

655
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:15,013
Oh, it's another bowl.

656
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:16,117
It feels kinda warm.

657
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:17,317
Oh, it's a crumble cake.

658
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,558
- Nope. - Cinnamon crumble!

659
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:19,737
- I'll give you five guesses.

660
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:21,311
So, there goes two guesses, you've got three left.

661
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:22,589
- Parmesan cheese. - Nope.

662
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:24,574
Okay, Coyote, you've only got two guesses left.

663
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:25,477
- Oh, man.

664
00:16:25,477 --> 00:16:26,818
Brown sugar, hot brown sugar.

665
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:29,122
- One guess left. - What, it's not brown sugar?

666
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,622
- Ooh, it's coming down to it.

667
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,290
- It smells like crayons.

668
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,384
Melted crayons!

669
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:37,031
- Nope! - What?

670
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,210
- It's kinetic sand.

671
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,364
- I don't even know what that is.

672
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:40,344
Can you eat it?

673
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:41,668
- Dude, why would you eat--

674
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,884
You eat everything, bro.

675
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:44,458
- All right, Collins, for the last round,

676
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,335
I've got something extra special planned for you,

677
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:49,332
but it's gonna require a little bit of set up.

678
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:51,638
So, if you would, go, other room,

679
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:52,529
down the hallway.

680
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,005
You can't see anything, you can't hear anything.

681
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,197
Trust me, it's gonna be worth it.

682
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:57,091
- Oh, my gosh. - Build up some nerves,

683
00:16:57,091 --> 00:16:59,412
we'll call you as soon as we're set up, okay?

684
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:00,444
- This can't be good.

685
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:01,570
- Don't think about it, just go.

686
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,645
- All right. - Just go.

687
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:03,478
- Okay.

688
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:04,311
Is this gonna be safe?

689
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:05,144
- Yeah, yeah.

690
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:06,487
All right, guys, now, this entire time

691
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:08,146
we've been teasing Collins with the idea

692
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:09,747
that there are actually dangerous animals

693
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:11,237
inside of this box.

694
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:14,101
Now, technically I cannot bring animals on this episode

695
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,125
because, if Collins was bitten or stung,

696
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,970
it would be a really bad situation

697
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,436
and, of course, we have to worry about

698
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:20,437
the safety of the animals,

699
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:22,918
but what I do have is a stuffed animal.

700
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,880
What I'm gonna do is actually play some sounds on my phone

701
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,027
and make Collins think that there's a dangerous

702
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:29,800
forest predator inside of the box

703
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,536
and let's see how far he's willing to go

704
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:34,561
to possibly win this what's in the box challenge.

705
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:35,715
So, if you guys are ready,

706
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:37,737
let's bring in the forest predator.

707
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:38,914
Oh, Collins!

708
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:39,818
- [Collins] All right, I'm coming.

709
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:42,387
- All right, turn the corner, turn the corner.

710
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:43,229
- Okay. (tiger growling)

711
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,607
- Just go straight, walk straight.

712
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,999
- What is that sound?

713
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,920
- All right, I'm just gonna leave you here, all right?

714
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,804
- Now, I know this has been a lot of fun and games

715
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:51,794
the entire time, right?

716
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:54,041
But, I know what everybody wanted to see

717
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,888
was something a little more risky.

718
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:57,588
Now, we chose to put you in a blindfold on this one

719
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,820
so that you could really push the envelope, man.

720
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,998
I need you to be extremely brave right here.

721
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,599
- Oh, my gosh. - And just be careful.

722
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,072
I cannot promise you that something bad isn't gonna happen

723
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:07,906
but that's what people wanna see.

724
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:10,060
So, if you're ready, place your hand inside of the box.

725
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,013
- What is-- (lion growling)

726
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:12,926
I'm just saying, like, it sounds like a live animal

727
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,269
is in this box right now.

728
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:15,880
Wait, is this box bigger?

729
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,860
- It is bigger.

730
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,050
- What the heck?

731
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,624
- I think he's getting nervous, folks.

732
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:21,028
I almost forgot to remind you,

733
00:18:21,028 --> 00:18:23,367
if you do not guess what's inside of this box,

734
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,416
you're going to have to eat habanero peppers

735
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,561
with the Bigfoot beard.

736
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:27,394
- That's scary.

737
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:28,227
Can I go.

738
00:18:28,227 --> 00:18:30,121
- Yeah, real slow. - Oh, my gosh, dude.

739
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:33,121
It's probably getting more agitated.

740
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,826
What the heck is that?

741
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:38,385
Oh, my gosh, what is that?

742
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:39,712
- It's gonna get upset.

743
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:41,375
- Hold on, am I, like, legit safe right now?

744
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,287
- I can't promise if you're safe or not safe.

745
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:44,621
Well, let me put it like this.

746
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:45,454
- Yeah. - You can either

747
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:46,936
put your hand back in or try to guess what it is.

748
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:48,647
You could just eat the box of habanero peppers right now.

749
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:49,497
You pick. - No way.

750
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:52,048
- It's one or the other, you gotta get this point.

751
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,635
- Oh, it touched me!

752
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:54,600
It's furry!

753
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,905
- Go on, one more, you got this.

754
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:56,946
Be brave.

755
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:58,558
This is your big adventure right here, buddy.

756
00:18:58,558 --> 00:18:59,747
- Dude, it's stuffed.

757
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:00,763
It's stuffed.

758
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:01,596
(screaming)

759
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:03,233
There's something inside of it, what the heck?

760
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:04,489
- Can you guess what it is?

761
00:19:04,489 --> 00:19:07,228
- Dude, it's your hand inside of a stuffed animal

762
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,114
- Hey, that's pretty good.

763
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,850
- Oh, my gosh. - Ta-da!

764
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,708
- My heart is beating like a mile a minute right now.

765
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,271
- I got some good news and some bad news for you.

766
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:15,475
- Okay. - The good news

767
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:16,649
is you got a point.

768
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:17,953
We didn't think you were gonna get that point,

769
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:19,825
but the bad news is, you still don't have

770
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,794
more points than I do,

771
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,818
so you're gonna have to eat some habanero peppers.

772
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:24,450
- Oh, no. - Come on.

773
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,898
I know everybody out there watching

774
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,344
also wants to see me eat a pepper,

775
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:29,659
so put on the Bigfoot beard.

776
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:31,243
Whoa, those are spicy!

777
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:32,423
- Yo, I cannot believe you're about to

778
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:33,516
eat a pepper right now.

779
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:34,455

The hair is sticking to my mouth.

Oh, my gosh, sorry.

This thing is like mad spicy, bro.

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,687
- I'm Coyote Peterson, this is Collins Key,

793
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:57,038
- Hey. - And we're about to enter

794
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,753
the spice zone with the habanero pepper.

795
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:01,332
- Cheers. - Are you guys ready?

796
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:02,550
One. - Oh my gosh.

797
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,981
- This is gonna be bad.

798
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:05,064
Two. - Oh, no.

799
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,793
- Three.

800
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:09,914
- I can't get it in my mouth.

801
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:10,792
- Oh, my god.

802
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,725
- Holy cow!

803
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:13,077
(screaming)

804
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:14,633
Oh, my god!

805
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:15,844
Oh, my gosh!

806
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:18,511
(both shouting)

807
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:20,309
It's hot!

808
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,800
It's like drippin out of my mouth.

809
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,145
(both shouting)

810
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:27,669
My mouth is on fire.

811
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:28,502
- Oh, my gosh.

812
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:29,409
My mouth won't stop watering.

813
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:30,744
- The initial hit is like ah!

814
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:32,642
And then, it just keeps going like ah!

815
00:20:32,642 --> 00:20:33,560
- I can't feel my lips.

816
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,171

00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:36,825

Bye.

824

Oh, my gosh!

825
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:50,078
- That is a hot pepper.

826
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:51,141
Water's not gonna help.

827
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:51,974
Milk!

828
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:52,856
We need some milk!

829
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:54,907
- We need some milk.

830
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:56,551
- This is one of the hottest peppers in the world, buddy.

831
00:20:56,551 --> 00:20:57,782
What did you think was gonna happen?

832
00:20:57,782 --> 00:20:58,764
- The worst are my lips.

833
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:00,956
- Captain tiger seems to be just fine, though.
