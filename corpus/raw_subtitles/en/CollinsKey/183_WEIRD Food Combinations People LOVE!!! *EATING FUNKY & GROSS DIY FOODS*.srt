1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,461
- You challenged us to mix Flaming Hot Cheetos with milk.

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,557
Oh, this does not look good!

3
00:00:05,557 --> 00:00:07,298
This is such a weird food combination.

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,676
- Ugh; are you ready?

5
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,717
- Three, two, one.

6
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:13,300
(loud chewing)

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,467
(moaning)

8
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:20,680
I thought the milk was supposed to make it not spicy.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,574
It's still spicy.

10
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:23,628
- Why would anyone do this?

11
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:25,651
That tastes so, ugh.

12
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,923
- You guys challenged us to a whole bunch

13
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:30,417
of crazy weird food combinations that people

14
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:32,805
actually seemed to love and so today, we are going to be

15
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:35,785
trying all of them, right now, let's go.

16
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,735
Time to find out what the next food combination is,

17
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:39,729
here we go, three, two--

18
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,546
- Oh wait I think we're forgetting something I think we're--

19
00:00:41,546 --> 00:00:42,854
- Oh yeah yeah yeah, sorry, at the end of this,

20
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:44,595
we're mixing all the foods together

21
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:47,490
into the weirdest food combination of all time.

22
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,859
So this is the bowl of doom, we're going to

23
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,483
leave it over to the side.

24
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:52,982
- Alright now that we got that out of the way,

25
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:55,565
three, two, one, oh, wait what?

26
00:00:56,945 --> 00:01:00,335
Doritos, marshmallows and nacho cheese.

27
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:01,301
- Oh my gosh.

28
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:03,633
- Alright, that looks good. - I think that's enough right?

29
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:04,876
- Oh, I have an idea!

30
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:05,894
- Ooh, what?

31
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:07,955
- I think we should dip the marshmallows in the cheese.

32
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,365
- But first, we juggle.

33
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:12,074
Oh no! - That's not even juggling.

34
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:14,655
- I completely failed, hey.

35
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:16,429
- Four ball juggling fam, yeah that's lit.

36
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:17,646
Back to three balls.

37
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:18,896
- Distractions.

38
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,463
- Suh dude.

39
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:24,213
Alright I'm ready, going to dip it in,

40
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:26,195
wait, stop stop stop.

41
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:27,194
- That actually looks pretty cool.

42
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:29,052
- I'm just gonna just plop it in.

43
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:29,885
- [Devon] Nice.

44
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:30,849
- So let's do this, actually I think

45
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:32,568
we should just pop the marshmallows on here because

46
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:33,769
we've got to melt them as well.

47
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:35,852
- [Devon] And now we're going to drizzle.

48
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:37,715
The final step; I have no idea

49
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:39,831
how this is going to taste though.

50
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:42,498
(ragtime music)

51
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:48,540
- [Boy] Dude this actually looks amazing!

52
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,092
It smells phenomenal.

53
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:52,741
- Oh it smells 10 times better than this other Cheeto thing.

54
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:55,019
- Like the chips mix with the marshmallows

55
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,592
and then the nacho cheese, heavenly bro.

56
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:59,974
- Oh, oh oh oh, cheers.

57
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:01,899
- This is gonna be so good bro.

58
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:03,339
Wait wait wait wait wait but first

59
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:05,218
we got a challenge, I want to see can you subscribe

60
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:08,117
to the channel turn on the channel post notifications

61
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:10,232
and give this video a thumbs up in seven seconds,

62
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:11,636
here we go, are you ready for this,

63
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:15,469
seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, done.

64
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:19,802
- If you can do that comment down below Keyper squad,

65
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:20,722
right now. - I can't wait any longer.

66
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,222
- Let's go for it.

67
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,449
Mmm, oh my gosh.

68
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,282
- Wow.

69
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:29,633
- This may be my new favorite meal of all time,

70
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,261
like I thought this would be disgusting

71
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:33,941
but all the flavors actually came together perfectly.

72
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:35,695
- Ended up all over my face and I just

73
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:37,926
didn't care because it was a second meal, just, you know.

74
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,819
- So whoever came up with this, shouts out to you

75
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:41,435
because I would've never put this together.

76
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:42,268
- [Devon] Alright here we go.

77
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:44,293
- Just going to spoon it in, ew.

78
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,257
Alright here we go,

79
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:46,590
three, two, one.

80
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:50,105
- What, what, grapes and ranch?

81
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:52,049
People like this?

82
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:52,882
- Grapes?

83
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,066
Want to crack them open? - Sure.

84
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:57,932
- Oh dude this is cool I can like spin the top off, pew.

85
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,672
- Sounds like you broke something.

86
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:01,245
Here is your bushel of grapes.

87
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:02,092
- Is it called a bushel?

88
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:02,925
- I don't know.

89
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:04,025
- [Boy] Alright, just kind of dump them in?

90
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:05,275
- [Devon] Yeah.

91
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:07,146
Alright, my turn.

92
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:07,979
- Ew.

93
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,812
- Alright here we go.

94
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:09,784
- This is not how you're supposed to do this.

95
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:11,117
Three, two, one.

96
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,224
- Eugh, mm.

97
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:17,811
- I can't I can't I can't I can't.

98
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:20,123
Uh uh, uh uh, no no no no.

99
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:21,459
Dude wait hold on I've got an idea,

100
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:22,713
we have to mix them all together,

101
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:23,674
so let's do this, put all the grapes

102
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:24,996
in the Ziploc bag right now and then

103
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,871
we're going to dump all the ranch in here.

104
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:27,871
- Wait what?

105
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,192
You better not pop it bro, you better not pop it.

106
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:35,882
- This looks disgusting dude. - Oh, I'm not ready

107
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,970
to add this in here.

108
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,891
- Alright so you have to open it up bro,

109
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:42,558
I don't want to smell what this smells like.

110
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:44,505
- How does it smell?

111
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:45,922
- Mm, just ranch.

112
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:48,218
Eugh, oh my gosh.

113
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:52,568
- Hmm, I wonder what's under here?

114
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:53,922
- Now this was actually suggested by the Instagram

115
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:56,133
Keyper of the week, if you want to be shouted out

116
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,367
as the Instagram Keyper of the week, check

117
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:59,112
the description down below to find out how

118
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:00,708
but right now I guess we're going to find out

119
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,016
what you suggested, three, two, one.

120
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:06,439
Bread and peanut butter and pickles.

121
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,272
- Wait what?

122
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,105
- Like a sandwich?

123
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:09,938
Oops.

124
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:11,199
- I think we should do something where

125
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,091
we each make our own sandwiches and see

126
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,174
who can make the best sandwich possible.

127
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:17,573
- This is some thick peanut butter bro.

128
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:18,406
Woah.

129
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:20,181
I know that Devon has a master plan strategy

130
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:22,801
going on, I don't but I'm going to try to beat him anyway,

131
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:26,189
so there we go, boom, you've been peanut buttered.

132
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,873
- [Devon] Now I'm making a skyscraper sandwich.

133
00:04:27,873 --> 00:04:29,781
- What? - Yep.

134
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:31,895
- Ah, stop dripping your pickle juice on me.

135
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,671
I could leave it like this which is kind of basic,

136
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:37,799
but I think simplicity might be the goal in this one.

137
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,632
- Maybe.

138
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:39,633
(air horns)

139
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:43,238
What, what, you're never going to be able to get that--

140
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:45,580
- Yep yep yep haters gonna hate Devon,

141
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,747
and then for the win, pickle mania, yeah boy, woo.

142
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:52,002
It's been pickle-ified.

143
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:53,468
I got to make an X with it, it's like,

144
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:55,253
this is the X Games of pickle sandwiches.

145
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,187
Alright there we go, bam, masterpiece completed.

146
00:04:58,187 --> 00:05:01,526
Now the moment has come to taste the sandwiches.

147
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,438
- Alright mine's going to be pretty easy to eat.

148
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:05,165
- [Boy] You taking a bite out of it already?

149
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:07,326
- Mm, this is actually really good.

150
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:08,849
- Mine's like real heavy bro,

151
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:12,020
oh it's dripping pickle juice.

152
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,329
I don't know how I can make this work.

153
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:14,221
- Enough stalling.

154
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:16,304
- I can't, I can't do it.

155
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:19,976
My mouth is stuck.

156
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:20,809
- Too much peanut butter?

157
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:22,636
- Way too much peanut butter.

158
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:23,469
- Really?

159
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:25,652
- Oh my gosh it just fell apart, okay quickly, put it,

160
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:26,955
okay boom, there we go.

161
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:28,225
- I'm going to take another bite,

162
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:29,058
this is actually really good.

163
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:30,151
- Add your sandwich to it.

164
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:32,199
(groans)

165
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,599
Let's see what you got in store for us this time,

166
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,521
three two one.

167
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:37,230
Honey Nut Cheerios and what, cream cheese?

168
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,063
- Is that right?

169
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:38,896
- That's a thing?

170
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,892
As you guys know I'm the best at opening cereal

171
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:42,314
because you got to make sure when you open it

172
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:43,505
that you can reuse it next time.

173
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:44,338
- Uh huh?

174
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:46,100
- The family loves me.

175
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,097
- Wait what?

176
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,236
- Yeet, yeet yeet.

177
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:50,631
- Bro I wanna pour it, I wanna pour this.

178
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:52,463
- Okay fine and we want to let you guys know

179
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:54,707
that every single Saturday at one PM Pacific

180
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:56,528

00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:18,040
so right now Devon do we have it going?

190
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,873
- We got it going.

191
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:19,959
- We just going to stick a spoonful in,

192
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,253
just kind of carry the lot out.

193
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:22,420
Three two one.

194
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,553
(loud crunching)

195
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,179
I actually like it a lot, 10 out of 10.

196
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,873
- It tastes like popcorn, this tastes like popcorn.

197
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,366
- You're so right.

198
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,547
Going to put a big, um.

199
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:36,154
That's looking pretty gross man.

200
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:39,071
Alright here we go three, two, one.

201
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:43,424
I love Oreos, and I love orange juice.

202
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:44,854
- Bro you can't eat the filling,

203
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,329
dude we have to dunk it first.

204
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:49,187
- Okay hold on wait wait, if I.

205
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:51,270
- No way what, seriously?

206
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:53,817
- We good, okay wait, can I dunk it?

207
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:54,924
- Dude go for it.

208
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:58,342
- Alright let's go, alright I want to try it, here we go.

209
00:06:58,342 --> 00:07:01,007
- And he can actually eat it, what?

210
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,507
I got to try this.

211
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:07,014
Mmhmm, that's so good.

212
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,049
I wonder what could be under here?

213
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:15,885
- Can I take a guess?

214
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:16,718
- Sure.

215
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:18,051
- It's a banana.

216
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,884
Let's find out.

217
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:24,073
Eh it's Pringles, and some, Nutella on chips?

218
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:25,573
Game changing bro.

219
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:30,754
- Nailed it.

220
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:31,587
Alright, I'm going to try these Pringles,

221
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:33,015
you try the Ruffles.

222
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:37,232
Ah, no, I hate it when that happens; why?

223
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:38,972
- [Boy] Your Pringles are just way too thin for this.

224
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:41,064
- Oh no it's breaking again, okay.

225
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:41,897
I got half a chip and a lot of Nutella.

226
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:43,397
- Three, two, one.

227
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,293
Yo.

228
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:51,592
- I think I've found my true love.

229
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:54,983
- This is the greatest thing I have ever experienced, ever.

230
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:57,805
- The crunch of the chip, mm, mixed with the creaminess

231
00:07:57,805 --> 00:07:59,141
of the Nutella.

232
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:02,489
- Mm we're adding this weird food combination with pleasure.

233
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:03,945
First some chips.

234
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:06,210
- Then some Pringles which are chips I guess.

235
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,021
- [Boy] And then last but not least, some Nutella.

236
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:12,188
- [Devon] It's not, there we go, ugh, that was a mess.

237
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:16,122
- This is the final weird food combination before we try

238
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,894
the world's weirdest food combination.

239
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:19,991
- Not excited. - Who knows, it might

240
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:22,511
be delicious, three, two, one.

241
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:24,245
Doritos. - Hey Mountain Dew!

242
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,580
(fizzing)

243
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,010
- Alright there we go, alright cool

244
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,234
so then I guess just dump it in here?

245
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:32,535
Yeah just go for it, alright, here we go, dump it in.

246
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:36,695
I can feel like, oh, this feels so weird, second bottle.

247
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:37,578
Ooh.

248
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:39,298
It makes like, it makes all the chips look

249
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:40,221
like regular chips because it takes off

250
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:43,173
whatever the Dorito coating is on them.

251
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,006
- Eugh!

252
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,666
- Oh it smells toxic guys.

253
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,863
I guess we kind of crunch it up a bit.

254
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:49,522
(overlapping talking)

255
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:50,367
Alright here we go.

256
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:51,200
- Don't pop--

257
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,033
- What?

258
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:52,866
- I thought I saw the bag pop.

259
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,197
- [Boy] You got to crunch the top of it a little bit more.

260
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:57,864
Ugh, oh, oh that looks so gross.

261
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:00,778
- [Devon] Splash guards splash guards splash guards.

262
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,978
- [Boy] Oh no it's about to get chunky, ugh.

263
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,540
- I'm sorry but that does not look good.

264
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,391
- There's no way this can be good.

265
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:09,867
- No. - No way.

266
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:10,768
Are you ready to take a bite of it?

267
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:11,733
- Yeah.

268
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,455

00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:21,777
Let's try this.

273
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:22,610
- It dripped on me.

274
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,610
- Three, two, one, oh I can't, there we go, one.

275
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:29,869
Oh, I can't do it bro.

276
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:30,702
- Not good.

277
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:34,672
Did you, did you just spit back in there?

278
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:36,480
- [Boy] So here we go, going to dump the Doritos now in,

279
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,230
ugh, not looking forward to this.

280
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,967
No that's enough, that's enough.

281
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:43,988
The Cheetos turned into pudding, literally bro.

282
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:45,017
- [Devon] They're so soggy.

283
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,910
- And the grapes with the, ugh.

284
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,494
- Oh I forgot about the grapes.

285
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:49,830
- Eugh, I don't want to do this anymore.

286
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,416
- [Devon] Dude I completely forgot about the grapes.

287
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,286
- Oh man the cream cheese and the cheerios.

288
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:57,491
The worst is the bottom feels like a flippin' sponge.

289
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,289
I got a full bushel of grapes, Devon.

290
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:00,122
Ready?

291
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:00,955
- Yeah I'm so ready.

Ugh.
