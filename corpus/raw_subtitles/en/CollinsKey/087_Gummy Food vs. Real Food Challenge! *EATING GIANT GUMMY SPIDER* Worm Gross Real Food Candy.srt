1
00:00:00,341 --> 00:00:02,813
- You would never eat a real hairy spider, right?

2
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:03,718
- Nope!

3
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:05,576
- I'm asking if they, nevermind.

4
00:00:05,576 --> 00:00:06,432
Okay, well we thought we would

5
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:08,423
never have to eat real worms!

6
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,496
(tape rewinding)

7
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,918
They're alive, uh!

8
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:14,601
- Oh (bleep)!

9
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:15,951
- After the last video you guys had

10
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:18,719
a ton more disgusting ideas for real foods

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,887
versus gummy foods you would love

12
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,035
to see us eat, and stick around to the very end

13
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:26,306
to find out which one of us has to eat a real frog. Help!

14
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,139
- Ugh.

15
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:28,588
- Round one. (bell dings)

16
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:30,526
We have no idea what these items are

17
00:00:30,526 --> 00:00:31,958
because our dad's the one who went through

18
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,162
all of your guys' comments, picked out the foods,

19
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:36,196
and today we don't know which is which.

20
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:37,029
We're gonna eat them.

21
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:38,415
Three, two, one, go!

22
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:39,886
- Yo! - Oh!

23
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:41,286
- Oh my god!

24
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:42,781
- Ah, it's a spider!

25
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:43,653
- Dude!

26
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:44,941
- [Boy In White Shirt] It's a spider in a can!

27
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:48,476
- I am so glad I didn't get that.

28
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:49,615
Mmm.

29
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:51,190
- So this is called a zebra spider.

30
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,215
It comes in a can like dog food.

31
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:54,239
I aint no dog!

32
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,115
(dog barking)

33
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:56,115
- [Boys] Oh!

34
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,233
- Ah!

35
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,066
- Ugh!

36
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,125
- They even have one of those little

37
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,291
like keep fresh packets in there.

38
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,753
Oh, look at that booty though (laughs).

39
00:01:04,753 --> 00:01:06,367
- [Boy In Gray Shirt] Bro, the fangs!

40
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:07,200
- Ah!

41
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,534
- [Boy In Gray Shirt] Look at the fangs!

42
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:11,379
- [Boy In White Shirt] I'm very upset right now,

43
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,795
not because I have to eat this, it's missing legs.

44
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:15,058
- Alright bro, you just gotta eat it.

45
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:17,249
You just gotta chew it up and swallow it.

46
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:18,974
- Dude, but it's like crunchy, I can't chew it up!

47
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:20,272
- Bro, you gotta do it.

48
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:21,105
- No!

49
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:21,938
- Bro, do it for them.

50
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:23,422
- No, no, no, no, no, no dude!

51
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:24,933
It's so crunchy, ewww!

52
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,870
- It's so nasty.

53
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,196
- Bro, licking it is worse.

54
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:30,132
(screaming)

55
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,785
Bro, I'm like waiting for this thing

56
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:33,024
to just like pop out--

57
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:33,857
(shouting)

58
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:34,825
Oh no!

59
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:36,266
(laughing)

60
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:38,643
(evil slow motion laughing)

61
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:40,976
Oh no, no, that is not okay.

62
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,215
- I'm just gonna start with a leg first.

63
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:45,048
Ah!

64
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:48,650
(crunching)

65
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,870
(shouting)

66
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,703
(crunching)

67
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:52,953
(shouting)

68
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:56,556
- Okay, dude to make this better

69
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:57,774
I'll just do a leg too.

70
00:01:57,774 --> 00:01:58,607
- Okay.

71
00:01:58,607 --> 00:01:59,440
- Alright cool.

72
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,312
No, not one of those, I'm doing one of these.

73
00:02:01,312 --> 00:02:04,836
- Dude no, you can't, oh my god, you're kidding me bro!

74
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:06,456
This is not even the same at all.

75
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:07,491
- Bro, it's your turn, you gotta go

76
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:10,066
and just chew it up just like I did.

77
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,058
It's no problem.

78
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:12,350
Three-- - Three seconds.

79
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,267
- Two, one.

80
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,344
- Oh, you know what, first I've got

81
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,248
a challenge for all of you.

82
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:18,379
I want to see if you can subscribe to this channel,

83
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,596
turn on the channel post notification thing,

84
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:23,638
give this thing a thumbs up in seven seconds.

85
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:24,471
Can you do it?

86
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:25,304
Here we go, seven.

87
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:29,304
- [Boys] Six, five, four, three, two, one, done.

88
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:31,959
- If you can do that comment down below,

89
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,279
Keyper Squad right now and we'll be responding

90
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,997
to people who were able to do all three

91
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:38,348
of those things in seven seconds, but right now--

92
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:39,181
- Quit stalling.

93
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,078
You gotta eat it now.

94
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,320
(shouting)

95
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,153
- I don't want to do it!

96
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:45,422
- Three, two, one. - Alright, here we go.

97
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:49,242
(crunching) (shouting)

98
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:50,930
I can't, I can't! - Bro!

99
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,003
(screaming)

100
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:55,065
Dude, it smells so bad!

101
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:56,714
- There's like weird eggs in it!

102
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:58,372
- [Boy In Gray Shirt] What are those?

103
00:02:58,372 --> 00:02:59,321
- [Boy In White Shirt] There's eggs!

104
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,734
- What are those?

105
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:02,926
(screaming)

106
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:04,176
What are those?

107
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:07,052
(moaning)

108
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:08,302
What are those?

109
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:11,687
They look like corn kernels. (bell dings)

110
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:13,605
- I am traumatized by that tarantula right now.

111
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,527
Traumatized, that was horrible.

112
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:17,074
Like what were those little yellow things inside of it bro?

113
00:03:17,074 --> 00:03:17,907
- I have no idea?

114
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:18,740
- What were they?!

115
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,619
But right now we are introducing

116
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:20,805
what's called switch it up, which

117
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:23,334
basically means we can switch 'em.

118
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,687
Like I'm super hyped but that's really all it is.

119
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:25,520
- Switch it.

120
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,934
- Switch it, ooh. - I don't know why.

121
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:28,513
- Oh pressure's on, here we go.

122
00:03:28,513 --> 00:03:29,346
Three--

123
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:30,535
- No, I think I made the made the wrong choice.

124
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:31,452
- Two, one.

125
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:33,387
Yeah!

126
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:34,220
- [Boy In Gray Shirt] No!

127
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,790
- [Boy In White Shirt] Dude, that's a pig's foot.

128
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,131
- [Boy In Gray Shirt] No, why?

129
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:38,290
- [Boy In White Shirt] That's a pig's foot.

130
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,993
- This cruel, cruel world.

131
00:03:39,993 --> 00:03:41,040
- Dude, pick it up.

132
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,873
- No, I can't.

133
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,564
- It's pickled!

134
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:44,397
(squelching)

135
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:45,895
(shouting)

136
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:47,549
- I touched the bone of it.

137
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,428
Dude, my heart is racing.

138
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:51,428
Bro, this smells so bad.

139
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:54,559
- Do you want to name the pig's foot?

140
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,532
- No way, that's just too gross.

141
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:59,700
- I think his name should be Chris P. Bacon.

142
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,927
- No, I can't eat that part, that part's hard.

143
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:03,395
- Dude, here's what you do, you take the bacon,

144
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:04,531
put it in your mouth, go (imitates chewing),

145
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:05,441
and give it a chomp.

146
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,274
- No way.

147
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:07,107
- Yes way.

148
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:08,835
- I'm gonna puke dude.

149
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:09,873
- You're looking way too fancy brother.

150
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:12,159
This is a pig's foot, you gotta get manly with this bro.

151
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,706
Look at this, you take the-- - If I'm gonna do that--

152
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:15,413
(shouting and laughing)

153
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:17,146
No, flip it the other way, that was disgusting.

154
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:18,518
- It's squishy.

155
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:21,084
Ugh, I got a little blood clot on my hand.

156
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:22,636
(shouting)

157
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:24,441
Hey Devan, just keep in mind you're lucky

158
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:25,896
because I'm sure the pig's feet are

159
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:27,888
the cleanest part of the entire animal.

160
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:29,290
- This is so--

161
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,542
(shouting)

162
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:31,480
Okay, I'm just doing it.

163
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,494
- Here we go.

164
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:33,411
- Two, one.

165
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:38,439
(moaning)

166
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,605
Why is it so salty?

167
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:42,438
- Because it's pickled.

168
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:43,511
- Why is it so salty?

169
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:44,550
- Because it's pickled.

170
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,269
(screaming)

171
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:49,176
- I just put a pig's foot in my mouth.

172
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,009
Ah!

173
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:52,969
Dude, I need a (mumbles).

174
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:54,367
- A what, you need an onion?

175
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,087
Get him an onion, get him an onion.

176
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,786
- No, no, I don't need that, it's (mumbles).

177
00:04:58,786 --> 00:04:59,961
(shouting)

178
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,892
- He's gonna go wash out his entire face so uh--

179
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:03,392
- Dude, oh my god!

180
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:06,375
(laughing)

181
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,382
We're onto the next round.

182
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:08,215
(bell dings)

183
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:09,636
This round I'm feeling a little bit spicy

184
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:11,157
and I feel like you guys suggested

185
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:14,092
a spicy item, not in heat temperature

186
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:15,940
but in like excitement level.

187
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,386
I'm gonna be dangerous right now

188
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:18,737
and I'm gonna leave them exactly

189
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:19,838
where they are and play them safe.

190
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:20,671
- No, switching them is dangerous.

191
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:22,851
- No, I'm gonna be dangerous 'cause you never know bro.

192
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:23,826
- Alright bro, let's go.

193
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:25,074
We don't know which one-- - Three, two, one.

194
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,078
- [Devan] No!

195
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:27,671
- Yeah, woo hoo!

196
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:29,935
- I don't even, oh my, is this alligator?

197
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:31,140
- Dude, this looks amazing.

198
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,973
- No.

199
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:32,806
- It's an a--

200
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:34,416
It looks like a rat but it's an alligator.

201
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,602
- No is it, this is alligator?

202
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,960
Dude, it looks like jerky.

203
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,977
- [Boy In White Shirt] Could I trade you actually?

204
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:39,810
- [Devan] What?

205
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,643
- I kinda want to try the all--

206
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:43,501
- Let's do it, let's do it.

207
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:44,532
Mmm.

208
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:47,400
- It smells really good (sniffing), like it

209
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,702
actually it kinda smells like a fart.

210
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:52,619
(fart)

211
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,651
- Good, not good, what's the verdict, call it.

212
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:58,680
Talk to me bro, what's going on?

213
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,434
- See, the thing is I just realized

214
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:01,983
I'm eating a dinosaur right now,

215
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,981
because alligators, they've been around for a long time.

216
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:04,928
- What?

217
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:06,019
- (laughs) There is no science

218
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:07,011
to back up anything I just said.

219
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,448
- I just want to know how it tastes bro.

220
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,531
- It tastes like chicken.

221
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:13,621
- Alright, here we go, combination of both.

222
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:14,454
- Real alligator.

223
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:16,704
(laughing)

224
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:21,362
- Okay.

225
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:23,915
- And gummy alligator.

226
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:26,165
(laughing)

227
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,182
What?

228
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,771
- Devan, right now you get a special privilege.

229
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:35,205
You are able to introduce this next round.

230
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,038
- Next up--

231
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:36,871
- Just kidding!

232
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:38,993
Alright guys, for this next round we don't know (laughing).

233
00:06:38,993 --> 00:06:41,983
- We don't even know what to introduce.

234
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:43,209
There is nothing to introduce.

235
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,153
- Do you want to switch them around or not?

236
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:47,719
That was a little bit too savage, I apologize.

237
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:48,856
- Yes, yes.

238
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:49,689
- You want to switch them?

239
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:50,522
Alright, cool.

240
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,065
This has worked out well for you in the past.

241
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:52,948
Alright, three, two, one.

242
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:54,008
- But not really.

243
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:55,405
Yes!

244
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:57,850
This is the one I got last time!

245
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,683
- What even are these?

246
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:00,183
Ugh, the sardines!

247
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,772
I hate sardines, I hate 'em!

248
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,227
Like I really don't like sardines at all.

249
00:07:10,227 --> 00:07:12,342
I've had them dumped on me, I've had them

250
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:13,175
blended up in a smoothie.

251
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:14,992
- This looks like a turd and fish.

252
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:16,181
- I've had them shoved in my mouth.

253
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:17,047
(shouting)

254
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:18,992
- Fish smells so bad.

255
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:20,163
- Ugh, these are horrible.

256
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:21,131
These are full sar--

257
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:24,222
Ugh, they're not even gutted!

258
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,847
Dad, you didn't even gut 'em dude!

259
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,081
(shouting)

260
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,353
- Oh, it split down the middle.

261
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:30,902
- Ooh, that is gonna be really bad.

262
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:31,735
- Ugh.

263
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,252
- These are literally just like,

264
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,532
it's just a full fish without the head.

265
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:37,408
- It smells like cat food.

266
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:38,241
(cat meowing)

267
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,074
- Alright here we go.

268
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:39,907
This one kind of looks like a fish.

269
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:42,297
- Just eat it, it smells really gross, just eat it.

270
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:43,162
- I mean people eat it.

271
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,189
It's sold at a food store.

272
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:45,022
Two, one.

273
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,832
- How slimy is it on a scale of one to ten.

274
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,769
- Gotta get that pun in.

275
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,476
- I was like about to throw up and,

276
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:01,309
that was in my tooth.

277
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:02,142
Alright.

278
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,072
- Dude.

279
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:05,734
- Let's go to another one.

280
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,052
(moaning)

281
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:08,208
And that's why you never let an 800

282
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,669
pound gorilla give you a bowl cut.

283
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:10,722
Alright, so next round

284
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,571
(laughing)

285
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:13,626
I think we're gonna switch 'em.

286
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,754
Sorry, that beginning was so stupid.

287
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:16,288
Three, two, one.

288
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,084
- Hey, yo, it's just a burger.

289
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:18,917
- Oh!

290
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,554
- That looks awesome!

291
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:24,628
- [Boy In White Shirt] It looks like a crabby patty!

292
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:25,461
- [Devan] It really does.

293
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,294
- Can I pull it apart?

294
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:29,036
- Bro!

295
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,047
- So I say we do this.

296
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,349
We're gonna make a burger commercial ourselves.

297
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:35,700
You turn that way, I'll turn this way

298
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,534
and we can do our sexy like bite into the burger.

299
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:40,232
Three, two, hit the music, one.

300
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:43,065
(slow jazz music)

301
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:45,425
(record scratching)

302
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,675
(laughing)

303
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:53,986
My mouth is--

304
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:55,211
What happened to you?

305
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,372
- I don't know.

306
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:57,297
I don't know.

307
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:58,592
That was not supposed to happen.

308
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:01,425
(slow jazz music)

309
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:06,447
- That was good.

310
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:07,947
My mouth is stuck.

311
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:12,118
(laughing)

312
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,034
(choking) (bell dings)

313
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:15,965
Whatever you guys suggested for this one smells nasty!

314
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:16,798
- Ugh.

315
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:18,194
- After this round one of us is going to be

316
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:20,969
eating a real frog, but first, time to find out

317
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:23,006
what is underneath here, and I gotta say,

318
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:24,765
it smells pretty nasty.

319
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,150
Devan, your turn, do you want to switch 'em or keep 'em?

320
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,281
- Well it smells incredibly nasty on my side

321
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,642
so I think I'm gonna switch 'em.

322
00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:31,475
- Oh no!

323
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:33,549
Well I guess we're gonna go this way.

324
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:37,138
You ready, three, please, two, one.

325
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:37,971
- Yeah!

326
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,008
Yes, bro, yes!

327
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:44,438
- [Boy In White Shirt] They're chicken feet.

328
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:46,021
- [Devan] Oh.

329
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:48,034
- They're like walking in a line, like little chicken feet.

330
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,343
These are like chicken in a can.

331
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:51,790
This does not sound good so I'm gonna be very civilized.

332
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,846
- Oh, I feel bad for you.

333
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:53,679
- Did they like strip it?

334
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,512
Ugh.

335
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:57,183
This is like whatever weird meat that is, that's not cool.

336
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:58,530
- Bon appetit.

337
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,100
- Yeah bro, I ain't eating a sausage fam.

338
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,001
And like out of a can, that's just weird.

339
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,905
I'm gonna opt for the chicken feet meat.

340
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:07,680
- Okay, I guess Devan reffed, eww, eww.

341
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,512
- Ah, it melts in your mouth but not in a good way.

342
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:12,982
- That smells so gross.

343
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:15,273
- Can I get food poisoning from chicken feet?

344
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:17,624
- You might be able to.

345
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:19,707
Dude, let's just move on.

346
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:23,922
The worst is that your breath is gonna smell like it now.

347
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,556
Oh no, no you guys, no, next round.

348
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:26,820
- Okay you guys, let's go to the next round.

349
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,256
- No, no, no!

350
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:29,089
(bell dings)

351
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:29,949
- Here it is, the finale.

352
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:32,980
One of us is going to be eating a real frog!

353
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,847
- And now it is your turn.

354
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:35,346
Do you want to switch it?

355
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:36,699
- Definitely want to switch it.

356
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:37,532
- Alright.

357
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,305
- No, I'm not switching it.

358
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:42,784
I hope this pays off.

359
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:44,408
- The whole house smells right now.

360
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:45,908
- Three, two, one.

361
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:47,504
No!

362
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:48,419
- Yes!

363
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,610
- I should have switched it!

364
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,588
- Yes!

365
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:53,507
I got the bad one last time, this is only right.

366
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:54,356
- I'm crazy.

367
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:56,010
Like I knew he was about to switch it

368
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,375
and I was like no, no, no.

369
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,799
No, no, no, no, no, no.

370
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,923
I'm not feeling good anymore.

371
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:01,737
This is-- - Oh!

372
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:04,487
- Bro, these frogs are thick bro!

373
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:06,442
Bro, this is actually super sad.

374
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:08,426
Like this one looks like it was hopping away bro.

375
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:09,417
Like it was like mid-spring.

376
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:10,707
It was like ka-boing.

377
00:11:10,707 --> 00:11:12,927
- No, that's just not right dude.

378
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,090
- Yeah, it's not right.

379
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,217
Alright guys, I'm about to eat some frog legs right now.

380
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,416
These are some real genuine frog legs

381
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,870
prepared in whatever, just a crazy amount of garlic,

382
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,451

385
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:29,376
The Keyper of the week is Bre.

386
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:30,561

390
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:40,046
By the way, I've never seen a frog this big.

391
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,187

392
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:43,290
- Imagine this as like a full frog bro.

393
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,623
Three, two, one,

394
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,500
and a half,

395
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,553
or a quarter.

396
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:51,386
- You just gotta go.

397
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:52,219
- I don't want to do it.

398
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,961
- Oh, I can see the spine!

399
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:55,422
I'm sorry, I should not have said that.

400
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:57,507
Just eat it dude.

401
00:11:57,507 --> 00:11:58,340
Oh!

402
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:00,364
Oh!

403
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:03,869
- Dude, this is actually really good!

404
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:04,702
- What?

405
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:06,005
- Dude, this is delicious!

406
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:06,838
- What?

407
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:07,828
- This is delish.

408
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,840
Wow, this is actually bomb.

409
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,648
- It smells so bad, how can it be so good?

410
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,169
- I don't know but it tastes delicious.

411
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:16,083
Alright guys, we'll see you again very soon.

412
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:16,916
Bye.

413
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:19,306
- Round one.

414
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,789
(metal slamming on glass)

415
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:22,036
(laughing)

416
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:24,655
- [Man] Are you freaking kidding me?

417
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:25,907
Oh my god.

418
00:12:25,907 --> 00:12:28,004
Can one really be that crazy?
