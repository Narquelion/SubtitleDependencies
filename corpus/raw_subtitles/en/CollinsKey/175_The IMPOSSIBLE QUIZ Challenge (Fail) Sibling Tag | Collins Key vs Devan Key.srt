1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- What's up?

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,076
It's Collins Key and welcome to the Thursday Vlog.

00:00:03,076 --> 00:00:05,917
In today's video is going to be the most challenging

4
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:08,721
video I have ever done, so I can't do it alone,

5
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:11,509
I need someone to help me out, my little brother Devan Key.

6
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:12,382
(snaps fingers)

7
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:13,750
Hey! Here we go! - Hey! What's up?

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,454
- So today Devan and I are going to be doing

9
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:16,800
The Impossible Quiz.

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,682
So basically how it works, it's an impossible quiz,

11
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:21,112
you guys can follow along when we try to figure it out.

12
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:22,189
It's probably not possible. - There is no way.

13
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,294
- Also I'm gonna let you guys know I'm doing a huge giveaway

14
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:25,127

15
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:25,960
I'm giving away a MacBook.

16
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,089

Got it, bro!

22
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:36,466
- So without any further ado.

23
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:39,564
Right now let's jump into this and it's The Impossible Quiz.

24
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:40,448
Let's get to it.

25
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,982
Alright guys, let's begin.

26
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:42,815
(fart noise)

27
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:43,648
(laughs aloud)

28
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,717
We're off to a great start this is super mature.

29
00:00:45,717 --> 00:00:46,562
- I laughed at that, I did, I laughed at that.

30
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:48,912
- The Impossible Quiz. Instructions, credits.

31
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:49,745
- Start dude.

32
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:50,578
- We'll start, okay.

33
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:51,506
- We don't want no instructions.

34
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:52,567
(loud zipper sound)

35
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:53,400
- Geeze.

36
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,772
- How many holes in a polo?

37
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:56,107
- I think they're talking about a polo shirt,

38
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:58,169
'cause then if it's a polo shirt it's four holes.

39
00:00:58,169 --> 00:01:00,070
You have one hole here, one two,

40
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,939
and then you have this hole.

41
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:03,569
- Alright, try four, let's try it.

42
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:05,646
- Oh God, I don't know. Okay.

43
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:07,185
(ding) (cheers)

44
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:09,759
- Alright cool, we're doing good.

45
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,092
Can a match box?

46
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,322
- No but a tin can.

47
00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:15,936
(ding) (cheers and laughter)

48
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:17,036
- What? (confused)

49
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,786
- Answer this question backwards.

50
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:24,236
- Yo, I'm glad I've got --

51
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:25,069
- K.O

52
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:26,529
(ding) (cheers) Yeah, turn up!

53
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:28,112
- Click the answer.

54
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,264
Oh snap! (ding)

55
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:32,137
Dude we are killing this.

56
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:32,970
- Yeah we're doing pretty good.

57
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,475
- We are killing this challenge.

58
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:36,808
- Put your mouse here. - Put your mouse on here.

59
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:38,270
- Can you hop the mouse?

60
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,478
I want to try this.

61
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:41,353
(gun shot)

62
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:42,186
(laughs)

63
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,019
Apparently not.

64
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:43,852
- Go outside of it.

65
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:45,393
Can you go around it?

66
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:47,508
- Oh! Changing up the game.

67
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:48,341
(ding)

68
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,174
- Nice!

69
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:50,007
- Onion?

70
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,367
- Onion. I don't even understand this one.

71
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,200
- A carrot maybe?

72
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,285
I don't know.

73
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:56,659
- Why would it be a carrot?

74
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,492
- I have no idea.

75
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,733
- What is shallots?

76
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,329
- Shallots, we'll give it a shot.

77
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,860
(surprised and amused) (laughter)

78
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,110
- The answer is really big.

79
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:09,123
I guess all kind of apply to this.

80
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:10,756
- The answer is -- (gun shot)

81
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:11,589
No.

82
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,866
- It's super loud too, it's scary as well.

83
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:14,778
Is it an elephant?

84
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:15,611
Try an elephant.

85
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:16,444
(ding)

86
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:17,381
- Oh, what?

87
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:18,214
- Search.

88
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,536
Oh, okay there we go we got little things popping up.

89
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:23,869
No way! - No way!

90
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:25,970
Oh a little sad face.

91
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,803
- A little sad face.

92
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:27,636
- That's sad.

93
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:28,675
- You're never gonna search for this thing Devan.

94
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:29,711
Don't click it!

95
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:31,347
- No no, I'm just looking at all --

96
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:32,180
- No chance.

97
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,092
(cheers)

98
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:38,386
- What was the question to answer 2?

99
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:39,446
Or what was the answer to question 2?

100
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:40,643
- Do you remember it?

101
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:41,725
What was question 2?

102
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:42,891
Question one was about --

103
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:44,284
- It was four. Right?

104
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:46,224
- Wait, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

105
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,847
- Question 2 was the polo, right?

106
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:48,749
- Oh yeah! It was four, yeah!

107
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:51,227
(ding, gun shot, scream) (shock and disappointment)

108
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:52,060
- Darn it.

109
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,893
- We lost.

110
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:53,726
- Yeah we did really.

111
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:54,871
Alright, try again.

112
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:56,644
- And now I literally just forgot what number two was.

113
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:57,644
- I did too.

114
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:01,625
What was number two?

115
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,110
- We literally just went through it again and now

116
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,159
I totally forgot what it is.

117
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,992
- It was a polo.

118
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:07,186
- It went with a polo.

119
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,505
What was number two?

120
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,535
Oh man! - Oh man!

121
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:12,368
No a tin can!

122
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:14,970
(ding) (cheers)

123
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,803
Choose food?

124
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:16,886
Oh! I get it.

125
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:20,129
Choose like it chews food.

126
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:21,964
- Oh yeah. Got it.

127
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:22,797
(zipper) (ting)

128
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,204
Whoa...

129
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,218
What was that? - What was that?

130
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:26,063
(laughter)

131
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:28,005
Oh we got a thing. Oh okay. - What follows December 2nd?

132
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,190
- What is this? Oh skip!

133
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,566
- Oh no, don't skip it. - Let's not use it, okay.

134
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:32,704
- What follows December 2nd?

135
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:34,872
- December 3rd, n,

136
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:35,799
a question mark. - A question mark.

137
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,533
I feel like they would want us to do that so

138
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,547
let's try a different one. (gun shot)

139
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:39,408
Dang it!

140
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:41,179
- I'm gonna go with n.

141
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,012
- Why?

142
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:45,168
- I don't know because 'cause 2nd, or 3rd,

143
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:46,372
I don't know but we'll try it.

144
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:47,205
(ding) (cheers)

145
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:49,297
- I don't know why it worked, it was just random.

146
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,130
(laughs aloud)

147
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,880
- Click the smallest.

148
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:53,966
(ding) - Dude!

149
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,428
What sound does a bell make?

150
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:57,678
Whoop, F'TAANG!

151
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:02,110
Blip-blop-bloop-blang-blanga-blo-woof-wuff.

152
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,246
- It has to be F'taang.

153
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:04,079
- No. - There's no other way.

154
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,884
- No it's this one here, I'm sure.

155
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:06,717
- No. - Yes!

156
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:08,093
That's what sound a bell makes, I promise.

157
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:10,521
- It can't be. (gun shot) - No!

158
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:11,975
Alright, I don't know, is it F'taang?

159
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:13,560
- It's gotta be. What else -- (f'taang)

160
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,537
(cheers)

161
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:17,075
- Alright, we're down to one life I'm getting kinda nervous.

162
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:21,240
- What can you put in a bucket to make it lighter?

163
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,383
- A hole, 'cause then whatevers in the bucket will fall out,

164
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:25,809
or the bucket just becomes lighter even of itself.

165
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,062
- Okay.

166
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:28,891
(f'taang, gunshot, scream)

167
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:31,354
- Okay, we're going for this again.

168
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,274
- So it could be a torch because --

169
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,352
- It would make it a lighter.

170
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:37,674
- If you light the torch then it burns.

171
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:39,211
- Let's give it a shot. Torch?

172
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:41,173
(f'taang) (cheers)

173
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:44,643
- Neigh whinny. Sorry no skipping.

174
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:46,698
It's a horse, right?

175
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:48,766
What do you do? Do you click on the horse?

176
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:49,599
- Don't click anything.

177
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,619
- No I think it's a horse. I think you just put in horse.

178
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:54,651
(clicking)

179
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:57,008
(f'taang) (cheers)

180
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,787
- Alright well this thing is not so impossible.

181
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:01,072
- What is the 7th letter?

182
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:04,778
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G - Oh, wait a second.

183
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:07,028
(gun shot)

184
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:12,480
- Do you want to just try one, like H or something?

185
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,813
- Go for it man.

186
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,639
(f'taang) (cheers)

187
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,794
(laughter) - What? That makes no sense.

188
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:19,877
27 minus 7...

189
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:22,259
Walrus.

190
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,637
I'm gonna go for walrus because I don't

191
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:24,818
want to do math right now.

192
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,152
(f'taang, gun shot, scream)

193
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:27,128
Aw! Shoot!

194
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:29,658
Alright, I guess I learned my lesson.

195
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:31,281
- The only one we haven't done is this one, right?

196
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:32,114
- Yep, let's go for 18.

197
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,267
(gun shot) (shock)

198
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,507
We've done literally every answer.

199
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:35,788
- We did try everything, right?

200
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:38,399
- Yeah we tried everything.

201
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,732
(surprised)

202
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:43,992
(groan)

203
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:44,825
(f'taang)

204
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:45,892
(laughs aloud)

205
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:47,585
Oh hammer time.

206
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:48,700
It's hammer time.

207
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,638
- Stop, hammer time.

208
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:50,732
(f'taang) (laughs aloud)

209
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:53,196
- Color in the correct order.

210
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:54,029
Boogy.

211
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,420
- Oh, B for blue? Try it.

212
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,328
- Oh we on track.

213
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:00,569
- Orange. - Oh, orange.

214
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,764
- Green. - G is green.

215
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:04,097
And then yellow.

216
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,275
(cheers)

217
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:07,108
(f'taang)

218
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:08,842
Deal or no deal?

219
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:10,450
No deal!

220
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,386
(gun shot)

221
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,071
Sorry. (laughs)

222
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:15,202
I don't know, what do you think it is?

223
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:16,035
Deal?

224
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:17,179
- I don't know why there's a seal.

225
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:18,049
- No seal.

226
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:18,915
- No seal.

227
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:19,756
- No seal.

228
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:23,113
(f'taang, gun shot, scream) (shock and confusion)

229
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:25,359
- Alright so I think we're down to seal.

230
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,089
- I don't know if we did deal.

231
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:27,922
(zipper)

232
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:28,755
- It's seal bro!

233
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,588
- Alright.

234
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:30,976
- Watch carefully.

235
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:31,812
- Now choose.

236
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:32,666
(f'taang)

237
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,783
- That was easy.

238
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,870
- The choice is yours.

239
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,141
- One life, one negative life, - One life, negative life,

240
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:38,974
Escape...

241
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,267
Plus one skip.

242
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,334
- I'm gonna go with plus one skip because

243
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,167
that's what I want.

244
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:45,858
(f'taang) (cheers)

245
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:47,941
Save changes to untitled.

246
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:50,719
- No, you never do that.

247
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:51,794
You always title it.

248
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:52,953
- Alright.

249
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:54,307
(gun shot)

250
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:55,649
- Except in this case.

251
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,482
Cancel?

252
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,315
(gun shot)

253
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:58,277
No!

254
00:06:58,277 --> 00:06:59,668
(f'taang) (surprised laughter)

255
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:00,501
- Alright.

256
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:02,658
- We got C and L, - Wait wait, hold on, hold on.

257
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:03,575
So C, L, C,

258
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,833
- I, C,

259
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:08,777
- T, I think is the last one.

260
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:09,610
- No, K.

261
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,443
So click, click the V.

262
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,748
What is this over here though?

263
00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:16,617
- Oh lives.

264
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:17,541
- Oh! (surprised)

265
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,374
- Got it! Alright.

266
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:19,207
- Nailed it.

267
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:21,059
- How do you kill a werewolf?

268
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:21,892
Question mark.

269
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,007
- Shoe polish, black pudding, maybe?

270
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:24,840
- No.

271
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,134
- We have one life let's just skip it.

272
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:26,967
We're skipping it.

273
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,370
Which of these places doesn't exist?

274
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,156
- Hold on, wait, gotta check.

275
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:32,083
(laughs aloud)

276
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,410
Why not just go for the first one?

277
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,967
(f'taang, gunshot, scream) (shock and disappointment)

278
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:37,997
So I think it's this one here.

279
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:39,767
I'm just gonna go with this one.

280
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:40,658
(f'taang)

281
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:43,391
(cheers) - What? (surprised)

282
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,359
- I hope you've been paying attention to

283
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,202
the question numbers.

284
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:47,890
Oh my gosh what number are we on?

285
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,723
- Oh no!

286
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:49,556
- Shoot!

287
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,389
(f'taang) (cheers)

288
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:51,402
- What was it?

289
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:52,235
- 28.

290
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:53,575
- 28, yeah boy.

291
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:54,577
What is this?

292
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:57,452
It's a ballet thing, it looks like a ballet bun.

293
00:07:57,452 --> 00:07:58,564
- Yeah, let's try a ballet bun.

294
00:07:58,564 --> 00:07:59,397
(gun shot)

295
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:00,230
- No I think it's abundance.

296
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,063
(f'taang)

297
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,440
(cheers) it's abundance!

298
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,552
I think it's this.

299
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:04,385
- Pork catchings?

300
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,218
(gun shot)

301
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,206
- Nope!

302
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:09,242
(f'taang, gun shot, scream) (shock and disappointment)

303
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:11,288
It's gotta be egg mayonnaise.

304
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:13,015
- No I bet you it's honey. - Honey?

305
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:13,930
(gun shot)

306
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,816
Nope it's egg mayonnaise. (f'taang)

307
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,020
Okay, put the mouse on here.

308
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,159
Oh gosh not one of these again.

309
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,993
- I got this.

310
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:22,910
- You're going so slow.

311
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,006
- I'm expecting it to change on me at any moment.

312
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:29,995
- There you go.

313
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:32,328
(surprised)

314
00:08:34,986 --> 00:08:37,220
No, don't touch green?

315
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,387
(f'taang) (woof, woof, woof)

316
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:44,338
It's this one here, this 3 woofs.

317
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:45,171
(f'taang)

318
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:46,692
Yeah boy!

319
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,158
- What are the main ingredients in shampoo?

320
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:50,408
- Cricket crap.

321
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:52,563
(gun shot)

322
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:53,814
Aw! - Wow, it took a second.

323
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:54,715
- Yeah it lagged out.

324
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:55,736
- We have one left so let's a skip.

325
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:56,609
(f'taang)

326
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:59,407
- How many letters are in his hand?

327
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:00,859
His hand is severed which is kinda gross.

328
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,692
But, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

329
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:05,610
- Is not an option.

330
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,109
- Seven, eight. Eight or seven, it's eight or seven.

331
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:09,942
(gun shot)

332
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,069
Nope, it has to be seven.

333
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:11,902
(f'taang)

334
00:09:11,902 --> 00:09:13,581
Yes, seven, okay.

335
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:15,596
Elephants don't like mice.

336
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,429
No don't skip!

337
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,788
(surprised) Whoa, what was that?

338
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:21,877
- Oh, what? (surprised)

339
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:24,181
(f'taang) (laughter)

340
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:26,320
- So you needed a skip to get that one.

341
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,128
If you press this button the game is over,

342
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:30,824
alternatively click this one to carry on.

343
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:34,410
I think they're gonna distract us instead of help us out.

344
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,790
- What do you call a wingless fly?

345
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,866
- Want to try a flap?

346
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:39,699
- Sure.

347
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:40,532
(gun shot)

348
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:41,365
- No!

349
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:42,198
A walk?

350
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:43,880
(f'taang) (cheers)

351
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,467
Can you get this question wrong?

352
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,508
No way so that's what I'm going with.

353
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:52,322
(f'taang) (cheers and laughter)

354
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,405
- Mary Rose sat on a pin.

355
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,192
(f'taang, gun shot, scream) (laughter)

356
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:00,870
It wasn't ahahaha.

357
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,898
- No it wasn't, sorry, I thought it was.

358
00:10:03,898 --> 00:10:05,390
- Burst her piles.

359
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,080
- Want to do that one?

360
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,164
- Sure?

361
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:09,476
(gun shot) (disappointment)

362
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,309
- O RLY?

363
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,525
No! - What?

364
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:12,414
- Is it Mary Rose?

365
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:14,323
Is there something else we're missing here?

366
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,341
(f'taang)

367
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:16,274
- I really don't understand that.

368
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:18,614
- I don't get that at all.

369
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:19,521
I don't get this at all.

370
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:21,146
- Oh, what is it maybe?

371
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:22,613
- Do you want to just skip this one?

372
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:23,599
Because we have one life left.

373
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:25,230
I do not want to lose that life.

374
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,293
- Alright, go for it.

375
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,126
(f'taang)

376
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,241

00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,292
- Don't touch pink. - Don't touch pink. What?

378
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:32,979
- If only you had a bridge.

379
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:35,524
- Wait, be careful we only have one life.

380
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:37,611
- I'm just gonna try to believe.

381
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:40,461
(f'taang, gun shot, scream) (shock and disappointment)

382
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:42,233
- What do you use as a bridge?

383
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,109
(gun shot)

384
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,712
Oh dude, I got it!

385
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,999
If you right-click it, you right-click.

386
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:50,386
(shock and amusement) Oh snap!

387
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:53,554
(clapping and high five) - Oh, bro!

388
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:54,387

389
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,637
(clapping)

390
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:00,384
- Wing?

391
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:03,168
(f'taang, gun shot, scream) (shock and disappointment)

392
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:04,234
- So it's not wing.

393
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:06,522
- It's the afro, it's gotta be the afro.

394
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:07,364
It's gotta be the afro.

395
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:09,236
- Oh, it has the same color maybe.

396
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,181
- Oh yeah, you think that it is --

397
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:12,285
(f'taang) (cheers)

398
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:13,975
- What is the answer to life? - What is the answer to life?

399
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:15,894
Let's count them all individually. Let's do this.

400
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:16,727
Give us a second guys.

401
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:17,560
- Oh there's five.

402
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,393
- There's five?

403
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:19,226
- Yeah, 50.

404
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:21,385
Oh, what the heck I miscounted.

405
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:23,824
- We made a drastic miscalculation in the beginning.

406
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:24,657
- It'll be this one.

407
00:11:24,657 --> 00:11:25,490
(f'taang)

408
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,434
- There we go, okay we just counted wrong.

409
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,158
- Bridget makes everyone...

410
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:29,991
Should we skip it?

411
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:30,940
- Yeah, let's skip it, we only have one live left

412
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,702
let's skip it.

413
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:35,066
(f'taang) (laughter)

414
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,566
- It's a puzzle so let's do...

415
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,851
that up there like that.

416
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:41,684
- Yeah, that might work.

417
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:43,151
Yeah, there we go.

418
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:46,244

(f'taang) (surprise)

421
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,625
Oh, be careful on this, we have one life left.

422
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,411
We have one skip left, let's just do it.

423
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,560
- Alright, let's do it. (f'taang)

424
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,834
- Best flash ever.

425
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,584
Aw, this is gruesome.

426
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,894
(f'taang) (surprise)

427
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:07,397
- What are they doing to my screen?

428
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:09,023
What do I do, do I touch that?

429
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:11,020
(cheers) There we go!

430
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,771
- Snake? SNAKE!? SNAAAAKE! - Snake? SNAKE!? SNAAAAKE!

431
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:14,896
It's gotta be that.

432
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,384
(f'taang) (cheers)

433
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:17,458
Dude, we got one life left.

434
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,035
Let's see if we can make it to 50.

435
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,427
Let's see if we can make it to 50 with one life,

436
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:21,260
this is crazy.

437
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,679
- Which is the correct spelling?

438
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,759
(f'taang, gun shot, scream) (shock and disappointment)

439
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,633
- Do you want to skip it?

440
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,310
- No no, just try slap.

441
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,972

00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:35,103
(f'taang) (cheers)

443
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,736
Slapp-me-do

444
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,486
Remember blue, red...

445
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,651
Do you want to skip this one?

446
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:42,484
- Sure.

447
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:43,951
- We have one life left so I don't want to waste it on that.

448
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:45,279
(f'taang) (fighting sounds)

449
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,192
I like this one.

450
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:49,452
(glass breaks) (cheering crowd)

451
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:50,487
(f'taang)

452
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:51,320
- Carrot.

453
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,501
- You got that one right, I was proud of you.

454
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:53,386
- I've seen a carrot before.

455
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,716
(f'taang)

456
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:57,182
(f'taang)

457
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:58,060
- Shanghai.

458
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,778
Never been.

459
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,126
(f'taang)

460
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:02,066
(clock ticking)

461
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:05,353
- A series of organs designed to break down food...

462
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:08,132
(gun shot) (shock)

463
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:08,965
(zipper) (surprise)

464
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:09,798
- Yes I made it through barely!

465
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:11,453
It was the one up there.

466
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:14,214
(splash) I hope you remember.

467
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:15,336
It's this one here.

468
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,487
(f'taang, gun shot, scream)

469
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:21,301
- Alright so we're going to start with blue.

470
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,301
Blue, red, blue, yellow.

471
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:26,678
Can you find it?

472
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:28,928
- There we go.

473
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:30,363

Alright, here's what we're doing Devan,

481
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:45,018
let's make this interesting.

482
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:47,395
This will be our final round.

483
00:13:47,395 --> 00:13:49,729
We've got four skips, three lives,

484
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,173
let's see how far we can get.

485
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:53,129
We're at 58 right now, let's do it.

486
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:54,013
- We're focused.

487
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:56,172
- We're in the game, this is the final round.

488
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,202
- I wish you hadn't said that.

489
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:58,137
- It's gotta be sheperd's pie, just 'cause.

490
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,177
- Is it?

491
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:00,526
(f'taang) (cheers)

492
00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:01,359
- Oh no! (clock ticking)

493
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:03,339
- Charge up laser.

494
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:05,124
- How do you charge up a laser?

495
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:06,509
(clock ticking)

496
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,099
How do you charge up a laser?

497
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:09,573
(anxious screams)

498
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:13,381
(f'taang, gun shot, scream) (shock and disappointment)

499
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:14,964
What just happened?

500
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:22,726
(screams of anxiousness)

501
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:26,198
(screams of excitement)

502
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,791
(cheers)

503
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,956
Bro!

504
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:30,073
(laughter)

505
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:31,631
I'm so sorry.

506
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:33,048

507
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:36,211
- I just smacked him in the face!

508
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:38,458
Be honest, did you manage to do that last question

509
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,599
on your first go?

510
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,622
- No.

511
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:43,438
(f'taang) (cheers)

512
00:14:43,438 --> 00:14:46,092
- Yeah, it's true we didn't.

513
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:49,163
- Wait, he only has three fingers.

514
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:52,790
(f'taang) (cheers)

515
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,126
- Thimple and click the moth.

516
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,203
- It'th thimple.

517
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:57,620
- Click the moth.

518
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,969
- It's moss, that's moss.

519
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:02,645
(f'taang) (cheers)

520
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,613
Bro! - You smart!

521
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:07,041
- What are chicken -- - Nuggets made of.

522
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,408
Not 100% chicken.

523
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,120
That's not true.

524
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,040
I'm gonna go with tasteless white filth.

525
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,649
- No bro, I don't know.

526
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:14,866
- It's that one, it's gotta be.

527
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:17,150
(f'taang) (cheers)

528
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,367
- What if it is egg is greater than 28?

529
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:21,987
- I don't think it's worth it though.

530
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,881
We're gonna hit some questions coming up where we're not

531
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,923
going to be able to skip so we might as well keep

532
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,271
our lives for those.

533
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:28,163
- Okay.

534
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:28,996

00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,048
- Click the largest. - Click the largest.

536
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:33,387
- I feel like this one's the largest.

537
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:34,225
(gun shot)

538
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,848
- No, it was this one.

539
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:37,407
(surprised)

540
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:40,077
We skipping bro, we are skipping.

541
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:40,910
(f'taang)

542
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,320
(meteors falling)

543
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,040
Wait, hurry up it's the end of the world.

544
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,873
Australia

545
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:46,998
Armageddon

546
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:48,991
