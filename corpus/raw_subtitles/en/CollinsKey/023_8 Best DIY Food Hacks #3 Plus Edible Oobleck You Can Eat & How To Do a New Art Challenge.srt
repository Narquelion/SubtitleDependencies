1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,890
- Let's see this watermelon turned into jelly.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,250
Three, two, one!

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,700
You challenged us to make spaghetti noodles out of juice

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,830
and right now, let's go.

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,280
To turn this juice into noodles.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,020
We have to use what's called sodium alginate.

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,040
We're gonna use two teaspoons right here.

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,750
And what if they work immediately.

9
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,710
Like the moment it hits,

10
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,820
and then we're gonna be blending these up,

11
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,292
and then we're gonna be turning them into noodles.

12
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:19,288
- [Both] Three, two, one.

13
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:20,121
- Oh, there we go.

14
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,509
Like a little smoothie almost.

15
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:23,360
My guy has a little hat, oops.

16
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,250
And done.

17
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,970
Alright, it got super thick.

18
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,249
Wait, is yours as thick as mine?

19
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:28,082
- It's really milky!

20
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:28,970
- We're gonna dump them out and let 'em sit

21
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,520
and that should get rid of a lot of the bubbles.

22
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,590
This looks delicious, it's turning into sludge, man.

23
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,540
- Dude, mine got rid of all the bubbles.

24
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,320
- And mine got even more bubbly, it seems like.

25
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,400
Next up, we got huge trays of water right here,

26
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,970
so we're gonna put this on top.

27
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,980
The final thing we need is calcium chloride,

28
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,330
and this stuff looks super crazy.

29
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,960
It's like a whole bunch of little balls, check this out.

30
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,793
Now, we're gonna mix 'em up.

31
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:48,080
Wait a minute bro, mine are like all gone,

32
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,990
they're fully dissolved - Oh yeah!

33
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,501
So now it's time to add in the juice.

34
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,315
So, we're just gonna suck off some of this juice right

35
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:53,360
(painful groaning)

36
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,500
Oh, that's so cool!

37
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,673
Yours looks way better than mine,

38
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:57,578
Mine did not go that well. - Oh yeah!

39
00:00:57,578 --> 00:00:58,960
- Now the moment that this juice hits

40
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,930
the surface of the liquid,

41
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,950
it will immediately turn into the noodles, aight here we go,

42
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,802
- [Both] Ready, set, go!

43
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:06,420
Oooooh, what!

44
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,230
- [Devan] Wait, I can't even see mine!

45
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,410
- It turned into noodles!

46
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,930
Does that mean that yours don't work,

47
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,740
or maybe they will work , we just can't see them yet.

48
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,009
- Oh, man.

49
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,680
Oh, that popped off.

50
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,513
Dude, I wanna see if I can get

51
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:17,720
a couple of little drops going in.

52
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,910
So here we go, a little drop right there.

53
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,290
Here we go, gonna go underneath the surface here,

54
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,306
just like this.

55
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:23,139
It's like a streamer!

56
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:25,512
Three, two, one, oooh

57
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:26,345
- How does it feel, dude?

58
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:27,500
- All the little bubbles in it, man.

59
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,880
- It's weirdly spongy.

60
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,977
Yo, what if we take a whole bunch of this stuff

61
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,346
and just pop it in, right there

62
00:01:31,346 --> 00:01:32,179
- [Both] Ooooh.

63
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:33,040
- [Collins] It's no longer liquidy,

64
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,780
it's kind of separating from my fingers a little bit.

65
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,860
Dude, it's kinda like a jelly fish,

66
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,957
like especially if you put the little legs on it,

67
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:39,070
and the real questions is, how did yours turn out man.

68
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,298
Let's see how it goes, ready?

69
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:41,721
- [Devan] Woah!

70
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:42,986
- [Collin] They worked!

71
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:44,509
- [Devan] No way!

72
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,484
- [Collin] Those look insane!

73
00:01:45,484 --> 00:01:46,380
- [Devan] Wow!

74
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,603
- [Collin] Bro, those look like real noodles!

75
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:49,360
- Look at how long this noodle is.

76
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,377
Time to see how these noodles taste.

77
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,530
W-w-wait, we'll be doing this at the end of the video,

78
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,410
and right now, we're onto the next one.

79
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,630
- Oh, I can't wait.

80
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,510
- You challenged us to make

81
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,750
a healthy jelly watermelon,

82
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,897
so let's go.

83
00:01:57,897 --> 00:01:59,440
Yo, dude, alright, now it's time

84
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,560
to gut these things out

85
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,253
and turn them into some hollow watermelons.

86
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,100
- [Both] Oooooh.

87
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,486
- [Devans] Dude, that's a whole bunch of it.

88
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:05,657
- Look at that, bro.

89
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:06,740
- You can hear bubbling.

90
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,573
- Wait, why is it bubbling though?

91
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:09,750
- Cause I got a potato masher in here, bro.

92
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,036
- Here we go, gotta mix it up a little bit

93
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:13,274
Oh boy, it's shooting up, oh boy, okay, here we go.

94
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:15,872
Dude, you made like watermelon soup in there, almost.

95
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:16,705
- Yeaaaah.

96
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:17,603
- Dude, try taking a little drink from it,

97
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:18,870
that looks so good.

98
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,390
Time to dunk out the melons, I'll go first.

99
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,648
Here we go, three, two, one,

100
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:25,650
- [Both] Wooh, yeah!

101
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,820
- [Collins] The watermelons are gutted,

102
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,600
and now it's time to create the gelatinous substance.

103
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,950
We're gonna be using agar-agar,

104
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,190
or agg-ar agg-ar, I don't know.

105
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,023
- Powder. - [Collin] You need

106
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:33,881
some water, oops, little bit too much, little bit too much,

107
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:34,714
alright there we go, ooh boy,

108
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:35,547
that's a lot, okay, whew.

109
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:36,380
Alright last one right here,

110
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,680
you know that should be about good.

111
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,997
Perfect, and now we gotta heat it up and mix it.

112
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:40,987
But in the meantime, it's time to mash up some watermelons.

113
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:42,310
Oh, for the juice, man.

114
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,180
Just gotta mash down like this,

115
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,010
so the goal, we wanna get as much of the juice

116
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,516
out of the melons as we possibly can.

117
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:47,940
Alright lt's see how this stuff is turning out.

118
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,470
- [Devan] That's gonna mix with the watermelon?

119
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,840
- Yeah, how is this really gonna work, man,

120
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,673
I'm kind of confused right now.

121
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,380
Next up, we gotta strain out these bowls,

122
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,310
but I gotta move my watermelon

123
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,690
off to the side over here, like this.

124
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,967
Three, two, one, midair,

125
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,983
- [Both] Oooh!

126
00:02:59,983 --> 00:03:00,816
- [Collins] Yes!

127
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:01,649
I saw that going a lot worse in my head.

128
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:02,870
Now it's time to add in the agar

129
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,538
and turn this into gelatinous goodness.

130
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:05,371
Just gonna put it in like this.

131
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:06,460
I think yours might actually work better,

132
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,950
mines gotten pretty thick, I gotta say.

133
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,893
I wanna see if the agar's gonna mix in

134
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:10,180
with the watermelon juice or not

135
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,230
'cause mine's staying rather clumpy right now

136
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,063
- [Devan] Yeah, I know.

137
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:13,531
Right now, it really doesn't mix at all.

138
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:14,364
- [Collin] Wait, wait, wait,

139
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:15,610
these look like hardened chunks of agar

140
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,670
- We may have missed a step.

141
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,210
- Dude this stuff is not dissolving at all,

142
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,310
so you know what, I think the solution

143
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,910
is to pop it back into the pan over here,

144
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,900
and then reheat it all,

145
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,733
so, no no no, I'm talking about

146
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:23,830
all of the juices, everything.

147
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,030
Yo, dude, it totally worked,

148
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,020
the agar is now melted into the watermelon juice.

149
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,180
So be very careful with this,

150
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,500
and do not try this at home.

151
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,683
- [Both] Three, two.

152
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:31,550
- [Collins] Five second subscribe challenge.

153
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,700
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

154
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,270
and turn on the channel, both notifications

155
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,840
in five seconds, you ready?

156
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,673
Here we go,

157
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:38,506
five,

158
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:39,339
four,

159
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:40,190
three,

160
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,023
two,

161
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:42,159
one, done.

162
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,992
And if you can do that, comment down below,

163
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:44,140
Keyper squad, right now,

164
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,607
- [Both] Ready, set, go, aaaah!

165
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,730
- Oh no, no, no. - Oh!

166
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,360
- [Collins] That was catastrophic.

167
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,300
- Oh, oh, oh

168
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,253
It's overflowing?

169
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:55,237
- Wait, is it already filled up,

170
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:56,340
I guess so, I guess so, here we go,

171
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,210
we're just gonna lift it up a little bit.

172
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,660
Yo, it just got plugged in the bottom, somehow.

173
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,620
Just tilt it in, a little bit, here we go, like this.

174
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,070
Time to close this off, we'll be eating them

175
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,260
at the very end of the video.

176
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,410
You challenged us to make edible glow-in-the-dark slime,

177
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,040
so right now, let's go.

178
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,510
Vitamins were made to glow in the dark.

179
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,890
Next up, we do eight teaspoons of psyllium husk.

180
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,480
Alright, well there's a little rinky dink teaspoon.

181
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,643
I guess, we'll get a whole bunch of those here.

182
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:15,950
'kay next up, we need the water,

183
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,370
then we're gonna get, kinda like the high pour on it.

184
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,060
I'm going for the low, safe pour,

185
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,947
Woah, dude.

186
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:21,780
- Oopsie.

187
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,140
Here we go, low pour, like that.

188
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,280
Here we go, ta-dah.

189
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,113
Nice and civil over here.

190
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:26,600
we're gonna mix it up a bit.

191
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,380
- Why is mine like, so congealed already?

192
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,213
Dude, your hand.

193
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:30,046
- Yeah, I know. - Turn it around,

194
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:31,604
it looks really funky. - I know.

195
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,720
- Is this what it's supposed to look like right now, man?

196
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,091
'cause yours is all watery, bro.

197
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,560
You know what mine needs to fix it, Devan?

198
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,540
- Water. - Nope!

199
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,050
More vitamins, so let's see this.

200
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,460
oh, wow, oh wow!

201
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,530
The mixture right now is just,

202
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,363
sorry, I'm trying to do two things,

203
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:42,270
I'm not ambidextrous.

204
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,184
I can't do two things at the same time.

205
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,710
- Woaaah!

206
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,543
- Let's see, we're gonna put this here.

207
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:49,530
- So now, it's about to fling everywhere, dude!

208
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,746
I don't even know why, oh my.

209
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:53,387
- Vitamins are in, so now let's mix it all up.

210
00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:54,295
(pounding)

211
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,880
And then just.

212
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,470
Alright, so we add it onto the hot plate like this.

213
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,840
- You're using the pan, you know, right.

214
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,670
- Okay sorry, gotta get it off this thing right here,

215
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,988
so let's plop it in here like this.

216
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:02,821
Can I have some more water,

217
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:03,654
I think that's really what it needs.

218
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:04,590
I think you were right from the beginning.

219
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,380
And the coolest is that we get to eat this, bro!

220
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,820
- You're excited to eat that!

221
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,210
- Now it's time to turn this into slime,

222
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,120
so we gotta turn this up,

223
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,318
as it boils, it's going to turn into slime.

224
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:13,816
- [Both] Oooh!

225
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:15,020
- [Collins] Okay, okay, I see you.

226
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,270
Dude, look at this!

227
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,520
Oh man, it's definitely getting a lot more slimy,

228
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,353
that's for sure.

229
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,186
The heat is turned off,

230
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,820
and now it's time to pour this onto our frozen marble slab.

231
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,143
- How is this thing gonna glow in the dark?

232
00:05:24,143 --> 00:05:26,147
I can't wait to see how this turns out.

233
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:26,980
(Collins screaming)

234
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,860
- [Both] Ready, set, go!

235
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,660
- [Collins] Oh man, it's coming out.

236
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:33,040
Dude, what?

237
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,796
- [Devan] This is not a pretty slime.

238
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,400
- We gotta cool this thing down quick.

239
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,350
The real question is, is it going to glow in the dark,

240
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,536
and how is it going to taste?

241
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:40,670
we'll be trying it at the end.

242
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,503
- [Devans] You challenged us to make

243
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,190
glow-in-the-dark oobleck out of potatoes.

244
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,610
And do not try this at home.

245
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,443
- The potatoes are peeled,

246
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:46,742
and now it's time to dice these things up.

247
00:05:46,742 --> 00:05:48,080
- [Both] Oooh!

248
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,210
- [Collins] Bro, this shot out.

249
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,250
I've learned this cubing technique

250
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,470
from all the cooking shows I've watched, man,

251
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,170
'cause this is exactly how they do it, man.

252
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,087
Time to dump it all in, so here we go,

253
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,970
gonna balance it up like this,

254
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,160
dump it in just like that.

255
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,700
Boom, and now we're on to the next step.

256
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,430
Yo, these got super murky,

257
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,090
so right now, we gotta strain out the potatoes

258
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,410
and get to that good old juice.

259
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,243
- [Devan] I think I got it, I think I got it.

260
00:06:04,243 --> 00:06:06,390
- Yeah, the biggest thing is that we need

261
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,730
the starch from the potatoes,

262
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,220
so that's what we're doing with this process.

263
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,790
Next up, we're gonna use this strainer right here,

264
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,730
over the top like this,

265
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,912
three, two one,

266
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:14,420
- [Both] Ooooh!

267
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,900
- [Devan] Just a little bit has overflowed.

268
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,910
- Yep, just a smidge, nothing too crazy,

269
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,800
there we go, boom,

270
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,840
and now, I've got the ice laden potato starch,

271
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,070
and now it's time to make the oobleck.

272
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,960
All the way to the top.

273
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,950
Here we go, almost there.

274
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,650
The potato starch is all settled at the bottom,

275
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,650
and that's what's gonna be the oobleck

276
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,000
so now we gotta pour out the liquid at the top.

277
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:31,700
Wait, why is it dripping down the side?

278
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,380
I gotta go very slowly right now.

279
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,350
- [Devan] I got it. - And done,

280
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,320
okay, there we go, boom.

281
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,153
- I wonder if it turns into oobleck

282
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:37,300
the moment it hits the bowl.

283
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,460
- It really is oobleck.

284
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,300
- [Devan] No way! - Dude!

285
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,700
Here we go, ready,

286
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,241
- [Both] Set, go!

287
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:45,906
- [Collins] Dude, it doesn't mix, it's fully oobleck!

288
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,120
For those of you who are new to oobleck,

289
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,450
basically it's a substance that's a liquid when you hold it,

290
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,527
but it's solid when you hit it.

291
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:52,860
Yo, wait, I just realized this is fully edible!

292
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,693
- [Devan] Dude, you're right!

293
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:54,900
- Oh man, we can give it a try

294
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,010
and see if the oobleck actually tastes any good on this one.

295
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,892
I can't wait to see if this oobleck glows in the dark,

296
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:00,420
and of course, to see how it tastes.

297
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,730
We'll be doing that at the end of the video,

298
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,040
and we're on to the next one.

299
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,290
You challenged us to turn orange juice

300
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,420
into a delicious, frozen delight, so let's go.

301
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,540
Just gonna fill up my baggie

302
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,373
with some orange juice right now.

303
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:09,960
Here we go, Devan, if I hold mine like this,

304
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,315
can you pour a little but more into it,

305
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:12,565
- [Devan] Yeaaaah!

306
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,017
- A little bit more, more, more, more, more, done, done.

307
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:16,850
I can't seal it bro,

308
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,669
you've left me in a very precarious situation.

309
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:19,502
- [Devan] Alright, here we go.

310
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:20,335
- Dude, you gotta get some of it,

311
00:07:20,335 --> 00:07:22,443
pull out just like that.

312
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,553
Oh snap bro, little bit more, into yours?

313
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:26,386
Alright, so now let's see if I can close it up.

314
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:27,828
- Did you get it? - No!

315
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:29,247
- I got it, I got it, I got it!

316
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:31,070
- You got it?

317
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,120
next up, we got the ice, just gonna add this in,

318
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,790
so here we, uh oh.

319
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,320
- Maybe we should help each other out.

320
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,260
- Yeah, okay, yeah, that's a good idea, Devan.

321
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,190
Teamwork is the dreamwork.

322
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:41,100
- [Devan Why do you make it so difficult?

323
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,230
- Why do you keep raising it up, Devan, Devan.

324
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,370
- So I can catch it!

325
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,203
- Flawless.

326
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:45,410
Alright, so now it's time for me to add my salt in,

327
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,200
so here we go, I'm gonna fill up the spoon first,

328
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,033
and the reason the salt is in here

329
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,300
is to actually speed up the freezing process.

330
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,310
It's time to add in our bag of orange juice.

331
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,417
Devan, smash!

332
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:54,580
(drumming)

333
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,850
Next up, I've got an innovative idea,

334
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,700
I'm gonna coat my bag in salt, right now,

335
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,124
so pop that in there.

336
00:07:59,124 --> 00:07:59,957
So if I have any extra salt here,

337
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,330
just gonna dump this on right now.

338
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,280
Now gonna lift this up and pop this into the bag.

339
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,480
Now it's time to mix it up and shake it up,

340
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,600
so here we go, turn it up like this,

341
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,674
and then just

342
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:07,738
(Collin screaming)

343
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:08,929
Salt in my eye!

344
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:10,213
I smacked-ed-ed it.

345
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:11,441
And then boom!

346
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,440
Aah, I'm gone!

347
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,590
Dude, I think that my bag is broken up in the inside.

348
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,423
Drop it from hand to hand

349
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:17,390
and just really mix it up, here we go.

350
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,640
There is no more bag, it is all one.

351
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,410
- It really has kinda filled up,

352
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,580
and I think your bag popped.

353
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,423
- Ohh, wait which one?

354
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:24,450
- [Devan] I think it's working.

355
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,155
- Oh, dude, dude.

356
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,860
And now let's see if this actually worked, bro.

357
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,710
Yours looks amazing.

358
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,200
Mine, questionable at best.

359
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,300
How did all the juice escape the middle bag

360
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,630
and leak into the second bag?

361
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,463
Alright, here we go,

362
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:36,296
just gonna have to pick it up,

363
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:37,704
lift, and drip, and drop, and go.

364
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:39,309
- [Both] Ooooh!

365
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,786
- [Collins] Yeah, and then get a little bit

366
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,791
of juice out of there.

367
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,938
- It actually kinda worked!

368
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:43,930
- No way!

369
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,208
- Other than the big leak in it.

370
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,558
- [Both] Oooh!

371
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:50,526
(laughing and screaming)

372
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:52,790
- [Collins] Bro, but I spilled over your lap, dude.

373
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,867
But let's see if it turned into a frozen delicacy.

374
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,392
- [Both] Oooh.

375
00:08:56,392 --> 00:08:58,100
- [Collins] Ooh, no way!

376
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,120
That looks so delicious.

377
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,560
We'll be eating this at the end of the video,

378
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,230
and right now, we're on to the next one.

379
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,800
You challenged us to try sushi art.

380
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,490
- [Devan] First up, I'm gonna slice up some carrot.

381
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,370
- And as you do that, I'm gonna make

382
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,413
my green, spicy, wasabi rice, right now.

383
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:10,730
Ooh, I can smell it bro.

384
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,990
It's making my eyes water already.

385
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,823
- Oh yeah.

386
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:15,050
Dude, we just started, why are you using your hands?

387
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,370
- The chopsticks weren't doing good enough

388
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,690
so I gotta get my hands in there and you know,

389
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,160
make it all green and make it all good.

390
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,150
Art is important, Devan,

391
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,080
and hands on art is the best kinda art.

392
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,340
Alright, gonna add a big chunk

393
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,070
of the wasabi rice right here, boom.

394
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,470
I call this the splat and pat.

395
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,440
Splat and pat.

396
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,273
- My carrots are done,

397
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:29,610
and now it's on to the nori sheet.

398
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,810
- Is that like, too much rice, you think?

399
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,690
- Uh, yes.

400
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,650
Now I'm gonna wrap my carrots in some nori sheet.

401
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,960
- My panda's gonna have some red eyes,

402
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,050
it's gonna be a fusion panda,

403
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,883
it's gonna be a red panda

404
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:37,990
with some black spots on it.

405
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,240
Game changing idea!

406
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,645
The cucumber's going to be the mouth.

407
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:41,810
Alright here we go, gonna take the cucumber,

408
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,560
and very carefully, gonna slice of a side

409
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,393
over here like this.

410
00:09:44,393 --> 00:09:46,940
And last but not least, we got this last side over here.

411
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,410
- Some might think this is a tongue,

412
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,660
but nope, that's the whole mouth.

413
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,520
- We're gonna take the beet,

414
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,287
and first of all, we're gonna drop the beat.

415
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:54,010
(funky dubstep)

416
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,775
- Nice. - Thank you.

417
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:56,820
- Time to wrap my second carrot in a nori sheet.

418
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,670
- That's a pretty juicy beet right here.

419
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,330
Oh, man, alright, it's all red on the inside,

420
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,590
which is perfect for what I need.

421
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,280
Check this out, I'm gonna take this thing of beet,

422
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,970
and I'm gonna insert it inside the cucumber

423
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,150
so there's a tongue inside of the mouth

424
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,740
'cause Devan doesn't have that, so I'm gonna win.

425
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,240
Gonna put a little hole here at the top,

426
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,266
this is where the beet's gonna go.

427
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,837
Yes, boom!

428
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:14,670
Yes!

429
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,890
I've like, conquered this challenge so far,

430
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,300
and my art challenge is going through three-dimensional.

431
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,460
Alright, time to roll up the first layer.

432
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,974
Okay, I need a second nori sheet.

433
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:25,921
- It actually kinda works, dude, look at that.

434
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:28,220
- I'm gonna smash my beet, all right, here we go.

435
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,053
Oh boy.

436
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:31,060
Oh yeah, this turned to some nice pink rice, man.

437
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,630
Yo, the pink rice is totally working.

438
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,990
The only issue is that I forgot to take off

439
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,823
the chunks of beet.

440
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:37,510
Three, two, one, splat and pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.

441
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,654
Gonna give it a little bit of ridge

442
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:39,487
in the center just like this.

443
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,570
I'm gonna have to use these nori sheets

444
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,697
to create some dark eyes and some stark contrast.

445
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:43,640
Art words.

446
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,980
- [Devan] You're really picking up this artist thing.

447
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,913
- Oh no, my panda's opening up.

448
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,860
Alright here we go, gonna fold like this,

449
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,180
and then gonna lay it down like this,

450
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,690
press it in, press it in, boom, perfectamundo!

451
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,770
Alright, just gonna pack it down with rice

452
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,251
here at the the top of it, man.

453
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:56,497
Just gotta keep the nori sheet down, right now.

454
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:57,827
Aight, boom, eyes are in place.

455
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,520
So add a beet nose, which you probably

456
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,353
won't be even able to tell

457
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:01,530
in the final result, doesn't matter.

458
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,460
Here we go, last but not least,

459
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,955
we got the mouth.

460
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:04,788
Here we go, gotta push the mouth down a little bit,

461
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:06,052
boom!

462
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:07,042
Gonna pop this over the top here

463
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,010
and just gonna kinda mold this one here.

464
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,380
It's called triangle sushi.

465
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,430
All in the name of art,

466
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,310
so my top sheet is kinda crumbling a little bit.

467
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,380
And to get this really in state,

468
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,430
you really just gotta combine the hands like this.

469
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,594
Here we go, boom.

470
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,220
Alright, gonna move my triangle sushi off to the side.

471
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,860
Now for the final step here, gotta take out my green rice

472
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,700
to finish up my panda art, here we go.

473
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,420
Real question, how is that gonna be wrapped up in that.

474
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,850
The thing about art, you never ask questions,

475
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,683
you just do it.

476
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:30,660
The real question is how I'm gonna eat this in one bite?

477
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,960
Gonna do a side rollover, here we go.

478
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,720
Boom, side rollover upside-down triangle!

479
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,827
Boom, there we go, mine is done!

480
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:38,710
Oh snap!

481
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,609
I can't wait to cut it open,

482
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:41,704
see what it looks like on the inside.

483
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:42,537
Bro, you're taking forever, man.

484
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,005
Dude, that is huge, and it's got

485
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,400
a ton of spicy wasabi in it.

486
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,233
We're gonna cut these open.

487
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,066
You get to comment down below

488
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,210
whose panda you think turned out better.

489
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,690
We'll be eating them at the end of the video.

490
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,760
You challenged us to turn milk into rock art,

491
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,340
so right now, let's go.

492
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,760
Step one, we gotta heat up the milk

493
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,050
and do not try this at home.

494
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,883
The goal is to heat it up

495
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,860
right before the part it where it actually starts to boil.

496
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,060
But we're gonna be adding in the vinegar

497
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,760
and the milk has a crazy reaction.

498
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,440
- [Both] Three, two, one.

499
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
- [Collins] Oh, dude, look at it,

500
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,140
immediately, immediately.

501
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,150
Dude, it's like curdling!

502
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,710
Wait, it's like totally separating!

503
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,540
Next, I'm gonna strain out all the excess liquid

504
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,130
and get the curds inside the milk.

505
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,370
So Devan, we're gonna pick this up and go very slowly,

506
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,203
- [Devan] Very carefully.

507
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:16,200
- [Collin] And be very careful, here we go.

508
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,800
- [Both] Three, two, one, ooooh.

509
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
- [Collins] Dude, I nailed it, bro.

510
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,220
Here we go, just going to strain out here.

511
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,260
Oh, man, dude it's all jiggly and funky lookin', bro.

512
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,410
Bro, looks like its own little ball of cheese right now,

513
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,840
like goat cheese, or something, man.

514
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,450
It's milk, and milk comes from cheese.

515
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,283
- Milk does not come from cheese.

516
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,600
- Sorry, its the other way around.

517
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,254
Next up, we gotta get the last bit of liquid out of these.

518
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:37,690
So here we go, just gonna place them down right here.

519
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,300
- [Devan] Oh man, it's so warm.

520
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,760
- All right, and now it's time to make the art

521
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,840
and fill these molds.

522
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,987
I don't know if we even have enough for this.

523
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:43,930
All right, here, just gonna pull it down

524
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,870
and press it in a little bit.

525
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,200
This is gonna create some really cool art,

526
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,320
and the best thing is that after this sits for a while,

527
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,540
it turns rock hard, like you can't break it.

528
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,850
Comment down below whose you think

529
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,683
is gonna turn out better.

530
00:12:52,683 --> 00:12:54,080
We'll be testing them at the end of the video

531
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,230
and we're on to the next round.

532
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,920
You challenge us to make a vegetable trumpet,

533
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,200
so right now, let's go.

534
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,120
So here we go, boom, the body of a trumpet.

535
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,830
If you're doing this at home, be very careful.

536
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,180
The next step, gotta make it hollow.

537
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,310
And for mine, I've got this little white

538
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,590
Christmas tree looking thingy over here.

539
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,582
And this here, Devan,

540
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:08,790
Qthis is traditional cucumber coring techniques, bro.

541
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,066
This is how the ancients did it, man.

542
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,051
- The ancients?

543
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:14,640
- People who've been around a long time.

544
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,730
Maybe if I rotate it all the way out,

545
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,494
oh, it's dripping out juice, okay, here we go.

546
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:19,170
(groaning)

547
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,370
- [Collins] There we go!

548
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,653
- Yeah, I think mine's cored, look at that.

549
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:24,010
- [Collin] It's like a telescope, bro.

550
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,870
- [Devan] So next up, you put the carrot in like this,

551
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,110
you gotta mark an inch out, just like this,

552
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,027
- Here we go, we got the two things here,

553
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:29,970
and just kinda wee.

554
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,350
So now, just gonna put the two coring things

555
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,320
together like this and it's a little bag, Devan.

556
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,153
You hit the mall, you know.

557
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:35,700
Ooh, I made it through!

558
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,878
Innovation, core through one side over here,

559
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:39,153
oooh no!

560
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,880
Bro, it breached the side of it.

561
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,970
I hope this doesn't ruin the trumpet, bro.

562
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,067
All right, next up, I have to hollow out the carrot.

563
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:46,940
Oh jeez, there we go.

564
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,978
The cucumber has a huge slit on the side of this now.

565
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:51,400
Lemme see.

566
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,233
I'm gonna have to cover that.

567
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,560
In an attempt to rescue my cucumber,

568
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,180
I brought along some nori sheets for sushi.

569
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,870
Just gonna go and lather it up a little bit.

570
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,703
Get a little bit of liquid on it,

571
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,790
and I'm gonna use this to seal the opening.

572
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,670
Gonna slice open the bell pepper, yum!

573
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,380
- All right, I think my mouth piece is done.

574
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,640
Now it's time to put it in the cucumber.

575
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,365
Yeah, look at that, dude.

576
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:08,600
All right, gotta cut off a little bit here at the back,

577
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,337
and Devan, be very careful when doing this at home,

578
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:11,620
cut off a little amount.

579
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,520
This is where the cucumber's gonna go, okay.

580
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,540
- Now it's time to see if my cucumber fits,

581
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,520
and no, not quite.

582
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,176
And I might have messed up already.

583
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:19,430
- Oh dude!

584
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,320
- I mean, look at that.

585
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,210
- That is definitely not your best work, Devan,

586
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,043
I gotta say.

587
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:24,490
- Hey, let's find out if this really

588
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,030
plays like a trumpet, here we go.

589
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,640
- [Both] Three, two, one!

590
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
- [Collins] Oh you know, we should actually try

591
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,520
this at end of the video,

592
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,180
so right now, we're on to the next one.

593
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,090
We've got all the food hacks,

594
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,720
it's time to test to see if they actually worked.

595
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,150
We've got the slime, and now it's time to see

596
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,280
if it actually glows in the dark,

597
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,130
and of course, we gotta find out how this stuff tastes.

598
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,410
So right now, let's turn off the lights

599
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,243
- [Both] Yoo!

600
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:41,990
- [Collins] Dude, this fully glows in the dark,

601
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,250
dude, this is crazy!

602
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,670
- [Devan] This looks so cool!

603
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,130
I had no clue vitamins glow in the dark.

604
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,240
Dude, if this stuff glows,

605
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,700
I wonder if it's gonna taste any good.

606
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,300
Well these things definitely glow in the dark,

607
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,640
and they look so cool,

608
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,032
but now, let's see if they taste as good as they look.

609
00:14:55,032 --> 00:14:56,300
I guess we'll go for a bite at the same time.

610
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,133
You ready? - [Devan] Alright, here we go.

611
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:58,760
- [Both] Three, two, one, oooh.

612
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,655
- [Collins] Wait if you wanna win

613
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:01,780
a fifteen minute video call with Devan and I,

614
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,560
text the word "try" to 81800 right now,

615
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,890
so pause the video and text the word "try"

616
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,050
to 81800 and you'll automatically be entered

617
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:08,960
in to win, and right now,

618
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,870
let's see how this tastes.

619
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,037
- [Both] Three, two, one, ooooh.

620
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:17,681
- [Devan] And it's like, weirdly spicy.

621
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:19,254
- Oh man, not a fan.

622
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:22,020
Just cause it's edible, doesn't mean it's good.

623
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,420
All right, we got the juice noodles

624
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,841
and dude, these things would taste so crazy.

625
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,674
- All right, here we go.

626
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:27,507
- [Both] Ooooh.

627
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:28,340
- [Collins] Man, I'm dropping chunks.

628
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,328
I'm just gonna take a bite out of it

629
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,161
and you're gonna go next.

630
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,080
- [Both] Three, two, one.

631
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,913
- [Devan] How does it taste?

632
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:36,420
- They're actual noodles, but like juice flavored.

633
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,680
I mean all in all, those were super bizarre.

634
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,150
Like, I don't know if I liked it or not.

635
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,983
- All right, here we go.

636
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,730
Oh, and these things were liquid on the inside,

637
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,190
dude, I wonder if it stayed the way.

638
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,150
- I don't know, man, you should try

639
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,140
taking a bite of it though. - I know.

640
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,643
Three, two, one.

641
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:50,180
- Oh, they crunched!

642
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,360
What they're not good? - Uh uh.

643
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,303
They're coated in something weird.

644
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:55,649
- Oh, oh!

645
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:56,530
- And the apple juice doesn't really help.

646
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,930
- Yo, those were disgusting.

647
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,420
Time to reveal the sushi art

648
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,660
and see how these things taste,

649
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,820
so here we go, ready,

650
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,846
- [Both] Three, two, one!

651
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:03,679
- [Collins] Let's see if we just give this

652
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,690
a nice little slice here.

653
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,523
Oh boy.

654
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:06,435
- [Both] Oooh!

655
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:07,268
- [Devan] Oh, that smells horrible,

656
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:08,101
- [Collin] Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait,

657
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,100
here we go, there you have it.

658
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,300
I think it's upside down.

659
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,690
It's meant to be that way.

660
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,200
Three, two, one.

661
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,670
Bro, I think you nailed it perfectly.

662
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,602
I wonder if.

663
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:17,435
- [Both] Oooooh!

664
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,330
- [Collins] The wasabi rice came off!

665
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,750
No no no no no no!

666
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,600
It's looking crazy.

667
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,258
- [Devan] Three, two, one

668
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:25,466
- [Both] Oh yeah!

669
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,648
- [Collins] Bro, even this one,

670
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:27,694
even this one looks like a little panda!

671
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:29,490
You nailed it bro!

672
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,020
- [Devan] Wait, he actually kinda looks a lil' sad.

673
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,450
- We got the sushi, let's see how it tastes.

674
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,893
- [Both] Three, two, one.

675
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,857
(painful groaning)

676
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:41,691
(agonizing Wailing)

677
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:42,648
- Whoa.

678
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:46,411
(incomprehensible mumbling)

679
00:16:46,411 --> 00:16:47,244
- I've got the magic, man,

680
00:16:47,244 --> 00:16:48,400
and now it's time to see if it glows in the dark,

681
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,320
and also how it tastes.

682
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,540
Now let's turn off the lights and see if

683
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,574
this glows in the dark.

684
00:16:51,574 --> 00:16:52,591
(crying of wonder)

685
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,060
- [Devan] Dude, this is so crazy.

686
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,222
What, this looks awesone!

687
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:57,055
- [Collins] And in the blacklight,

688
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:59,637
it looks really crazy, man, cause the way it falls.

689
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:00,730
(shouting)

690
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,957
- [Devan] It looks like some sort of creamy delight.

691
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:05,120
- [Collin] It smells like an alien substance.

692
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,000
- [Both] Ready, set, go!

693
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,833
- [Devan] Oh!

694
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,031
Whoa, that's kinda sweet.

695
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:13,460
- Ohh, what is going on?

696
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,207
It's bizarre cause like, I take a bite out of it,

697
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,780
and it like, falls out of your mouth.

698
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,810
I recommend you never eat this one.

699
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,835
We've got a frozen orange delight right here.

700
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,670
Let's see how this tastes, we're gonna pop it open, woaah!

701
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,503
Oh yeah!

702
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,010
Here we go, take a big spoonful like this,

703
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,883
- [Both] Three, two, one.

704
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,995
- [Collins] Ow, it's so good but like, so cold.

705
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:37,904
- That's so good!

706
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,270
- I wanna see if yours is colder than mine, though.

707
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,073
- Okay, all right, it's decided dude, wow.

708
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:43,670
- All right, we've got the vegetable trumpets,

709
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,530
and now it's time to see if they really make some music.

710
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,363
Who'll go first, here we go.

711
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:47,847
- [Both] Three, two, one.

712
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:49,630
(Collins blowing veggie trumpet)

713
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,417
- Sounds like a really frustrated man.

714
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,250
(blowing veggie trumpet)

715
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,030
Collin, it sounds like you're yelling into the trumpet,

716
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,955
not playing it.

717
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:56,697
All right, here we go, ready, set, go.

718
00:17:56,697 --> 00:17:57,760
(Devan blowing veggie trumpet)

719
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,500
- Oh man, I can't tell if that's your spit,

720
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,563
or the actual stuff coming out the cucumber.

721
00:18:02,954 --> 00:18:03,814
- Seed.

722
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:05,044
- Did you like inhale a seed?

723
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:05,877
- Yeah, I did!

724
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:08,090
- We got the rock-hard milk,

725
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,060
and let's see if it actually turned rock hard.

726
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,561
- Three, two, one.

727
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:12,490
- [Both] Oooh.

728
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,690
- [Collins] Dude, wait wait wait wait wait,

729
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,070
before you touch it, it's time for me to get mine out.

730
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,393
Three, two, one,

731
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,840
how did my crab fall apart?

732
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,673
- It's a lobster.

733
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:20,960
- Let's see if it's actually rock-solid.

734
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,373
- [Both] Three, two, one.

735
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,437
- [Devan] Mine is!

736
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,270
- Mine's like all crumbly.

737
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,170
- It's a little crown!

738
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,810
- Let's see if this watermelon turned into jelly!

739
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,197
- [Both] Three, two, one!

740
00:18:30,513 --> 00:18:32,763
(crashing)

741
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:38,643
(screaming in wonder)

742
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:39,476
- Oh my god, dude.

743
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:40,891
Dude, it like, totally broke apart,

744
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:42,760
but the watermelon's like stuck

745
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,590
inside on the rind, right now.

746
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,970
Now it's more like sandpaper.

747
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,020
It's not as smooth as I would have liked,

748
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,360
but look, it's breaking open.

749
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,120
Oh my gosh, it's so satisfying!

750
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,320
That looks so cool!

751
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,030
Oh snap, it's such a big chunk and it's so jiggly!

752
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,192
All right, well mine totally works,

753
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:58,450

754
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,562

00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:01,001

- [Collin] Dude, it looks like it's gonna taste amazing.

759
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,730
- Mine is breaking off.

760
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,160
- Oh no, there's a little but of funkiness to mine,

761
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,713
and I just wanna see if it's juggle-able.

762
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:12,546
Wait dude, can I hold it?

763
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:13,379
- [Devan] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

764
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:14,422
I wanna try for a second.

765
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:16,450
Oh my gosh, it's like totally see-through, too.

766
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,811
This is so wild!

767
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:19,160
