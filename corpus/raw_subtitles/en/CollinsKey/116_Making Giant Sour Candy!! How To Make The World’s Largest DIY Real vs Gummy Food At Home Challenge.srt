1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,119
- You challenged us to make a whole bunch

2
00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:02,330
of giant candy like this.

3
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,163
Check it out.

4
00:00:03,163 --> 00:00:03,996
Boom, look at that!

5
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:04,829
- Whoa!

6
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:05,912
Wait a second, lemme try!

7
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:06,745
Oh!

8
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:07,625
- Nah, bro, you kidding me, man?

9
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:08,458
All right, no more magic.

10
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,684
It's time to make some giant kinder eggs, so let's go.

11
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:12,134
We have the kinder egg mold, a whole bunch of chocolate--

12
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:12,967
- Wait, there's mold?

13
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:14,228
Where's the mold?

14
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:15,972
- Devan, these are molds, it's how cooking works.

15
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:16,805
Come on.

16
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:17,638
- I'm just kidding.

17
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:18,636
- Time to fill it in, so here we go, ooh!

18
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:19,974
What is that?

19
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:22,122
- This is cookie dough that I dyed black

20
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,602
to look like a geode.

21
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:25,063
There are three parts to the kinder egg.

22
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:26,845
There's a chocolate outside, the filling,

23
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:28,609
and then the truffle on the inside.

24
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:29,952
I'm making the truffle on the inside,

25
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,599
you're making the chocolate exteriors.

26
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,305
- I feel like a chocolatier right now.

27
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:34,138
Oh!

28
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:35,436
Dude, I'm like one of the three musketeers

29
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,379
but with chocolatiers, man!

30
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:39,923
Just a whole bunch of dudes covered in chocolate.

31
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:41,864
- Oh, dude, since this is gonna be a giant kinder egg,

32
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:44,296
I'm gonna make a bunch of truffles on the inside.

33
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:45,129
- Okay.

34
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:45,962
I'm just trying to get this--

35
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:46,988
- Are you kidding me, dude?

36
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:47,821
- Oh, man.

37
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,063
Well, that wiggles a little bit more

38
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:50,969
than it should right now.

39
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,541
I gotta grab this mold over here,

40
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,358
do a quick little flippity flipadoo.

41
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:55,932
One, two, three.

42
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:57,409
(crashing noise)

43
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:58,923
I kinda bailed mid-way.

44
00:00:58,923 --> 00:00:59,756
So here we go.

45
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:00,589
So, I'm just gonna take it like this,

46
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:01,422
just gonna squeeze it down.

47
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:02,255
What are you doing?

48
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:03,088
- I'm putting these into the oven

49
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:04,106
and letting them expand.

50
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,607
- So as your geode truffles are baking,

51
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,922
my egg is gonna be shaking.

52
00:01:06,922 --> 00:01:09,589
We call this the shake and bake.

53
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:13,144
Wow, that wasn't fun.

54
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:14,180
Time for me to shake this around.

55
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,013
So here we go, wow.

56
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:16,283
- Wow, all right then.

57
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:18,959
- Coat the inside like that, okay!

58
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,125
All right, that's pretty tiring,

59
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,186
so there we go, egg is--

60
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:23,019
- That hurt?

61
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:23,852
- Yeah.

62
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:24,685
Now we just gotta fill in the filling

63
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:25,995
as well as the little truffle thingys on the inside.

64
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:26,879
Is yours done cooking yet?

65
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,712
- Not yet.

66
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,940
(elevator music)

67
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,773
And we're done!

68
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:31,452
- Okay, you didn't need to wake me up like that, man.

69
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:32,401
I was having a great dream.

70
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:33,650
- Careful, the oven's open.

71
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,499
- I wake up to such a dangerous world.

72
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:37,990
- All right, gonna pull these things out of the oven.

73
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,739
Here, thank you for closing the oven for me.

74
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,033
And now, I have these halves.

75
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,688
Having some troubles there?

76
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:43,521
- I got it.

77
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:44,904
All right, well my egg is all ready to go.

78
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:45,797
So now, it's gotta let it--

79
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:46,838
- Whoa, you're already done?

80
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:48,962
- Nope, what I meant to say, was it's not ready to go,

81
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:50,514
and I need to put it off to the side

82
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:51,949
to let it set in the fridge.

83
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:52,782
- All right then, well.

84
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:53,615
- It's my child.

85
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:54,448
- As you do--

86
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,281
What?

87
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,114
- Nothing.

88
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:56,947
- As you do that, I'm gonna hollow out

89
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:58,102
the rest of these, here, and then

90
00:01:58,102 --> 00:01:59,365
fill em up with these nice rocks.

91
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:00,198
What are you--

92
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:01,031
- Somehow I forgot the fridge is over here.

93
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:03,006
- I got a shaker here that also doubles as a hammer, so.

94
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,327
- Yeah, well I got a hook that also--

95
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:05,225
- Is a hook.

96
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,058
- Doubles as a hook.

97
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:06,891
- Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no!

98
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:07,724
I think that's one of those pressure point

99
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:08,557
things for your back.

100
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:09,390
- Yeah right, man.

101
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,223
- Yeah, seriously.

102
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:11,056
(makes painful noise)

103
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:11,889
Oh, geez.

104
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:12,722
Here we go.

105
00:02:12,722 --> 00:02:13,593
- Oh my gosh.

106
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:15,087
I feel like I just got like tasered.

107
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:16,178
- You've gotten tasered before?

108
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,924
- It was a rough weekend.

109
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:19,096
Gonna take the bag like this.

110
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:21,836
(banging noise)

111
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:22,669
- Got a problem, bro?

112
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:23,523
You just stopped.

113
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:24,771
- I feel uncomfortable right now.

114
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:25,995
- How could you feel uncomfortable?

115
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:26,921
- Who are you?

116
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:27,927
You've changed!

117
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:29,137
You are now me!

118
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:30,689
And I'm you!

119
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:31,644
- Yeah!

120
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:32,856
- This is weird!

121
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:34,455
Here we go, gonna add in a whole bunch

122
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:35,410
of sour patch kids right now, in here, like this.

123
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,502
Whoa.

124
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:37,507
I can't talk over that, man.

125
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:38,340
- Yes, you can.

126
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,173
- No, I can't.

127
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:40,006
- And you will.

128
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:40,839
- I got a whole bunch of sour patch kids here,

129
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:41,871
so now, I just gotta melt all these

130
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:42,852
sour patch kids down again.

131
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:43,767
This is gonna be--

132
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,509
I can't even right now.

133
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:47,947
This is gonna be the inside filling for my kinder egg.

134
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:49,003
- [Devan] Look at this, man!

135
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,298
This is looking sweet!

136
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:51,718
- I melted down all the sour patch kids.

137
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:53,217
I had to add in some blue food coloring,

138
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:54,311
'cause it was looking pretty funky.

139
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:56,269
- I've got half of the geode truffle done,

140
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:58,278
but now, I have to coat it all in chocolate.

141
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,151
- The next part of my kinder egg,

142
00:02:59,151 --> 00:03:00,071
I'm doing a filling with this

143
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,539
jet-puffed marshmallow right over here.

144
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,144
- Wait, I wonder why they call it jet-puffed?

145
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:04,170
- Oh, you've never seen it before?

146
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,635
It's this signature look, man.

147
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:06,722
Here we go, three, two, one.

148
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:08,493
Boom, look at that jet engine, man!

149
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:09,898
- Whoa, are you kidding, it's like the arm rocket!

150
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,836
- It's awesome, bro!

151
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:11,669
- Okay, then.

152
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:12,502
- And the best part is boom,

153
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:14,005
look at that, it can fly by itself, man!

154
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:15,071
- Is it pointing at me?

155
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,451
- Yeah, it's building up a little in the back.

156
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,291
(explosion noise)

157
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,124
No!

158
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:20,957
- No, no!

159
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:23,207
What did you do?

160
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:24,040
- Nothing!

161
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,873
- I have a hole in my chest!

162
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,195
- Well Devan, as you figure that out,

163
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:27,452
I'm gonna continue making my kinder egg right now.

164
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:28,285
- Are you kidding me?

165
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:29,120
You gotta help me out!

166
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,346
The next thing for my mousse sauce

167
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:32,029
is putting in this cool whip.

168
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:32,934
- The next part of my kinder egg,

169
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:33,767
I'm doing a filling with this

170
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,361
jet-puffed marshmallow right over here.

171
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:37,267
Yeah, we had a very bad experience with this stuff.

172
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,100
- Yeah.

173
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,113
- Time to tear open some pop rocks right now

174
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:40,049
and just add these in.

175
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,094
Oh, boy, okay there we go.

176
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:43,117
Dude that sounds so crazy, man.

177
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:43,950
- Whoa!

178
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,785
- All right, well now time to mix it all up.

179
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:47,057
- Also coated the inside of these bowls here

180
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,659
with some chocolate, now I'm gonna add this--

181
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:49,818
What are you doing?

182
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:50,651
- Hold on.

183
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,484
- What are you doing?

184
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:52,317
- I gotta inspect it.

185
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:53,150
- Why?

186
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,983
(sniffing)

187
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:54,816
- Yep, it's chocolate.

188
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:55,649
You never know with Devan.

189
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:56,482
You just never know.

190
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:57,315
- You kidding?

191
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:58,148
With me?

192
00:03:58,148 --> 00:03:58,981
Whoa.

193
00:03:58,981 --> 00:03:59,814
Okay, there, yep, yep, yep.

194
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:00,647
- You wanted us to use this, if you're

195
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:01,540
not even using a piping bag properly.

196
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,373
(gulp)

197
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:03,434
I'ma keep mixing this over here.

198
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:04,962
- Yep, the piping bag doesn't really work.

199
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:06,355
I'm just adding it in like this.

200
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:07,442
- Oh, wait, wait, wait!

201
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:08,275
Oh, but wait!

202
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:09,108
Oh!

203
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:13,566
I get it now!

204
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:14,399
You're doing for the truffle,

205
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,232
you got chocolate on the outside,

206
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,691
chocolate mousse on the inside,

207
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,889
and then you're gonna use these geodes inside that.

208
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:19,771
- Exactly!

209
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:22,505
- Holy cow, the whole dish just increased exponentially.

210
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:23,843
- Got the two domes done,

211
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:25,959
now it's time to grab the geodes and put em in.

212
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,585
So, there's one right there.

213
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:28,522
- For my truffle, we've got a whole bunch

214
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:29,696
of jolly ranchers over here.

215
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:31,067
That was a quick grab.

216
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:31,900
Oh!

217
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,853
- That wasn't supposed to open yet.

218
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:34,061
- Oh, are you kidding me, Devan?

219
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:34,894
- Oh, man.

220
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:35,727
- I'm gonna take a whole bunch of jolly ranchers,

221
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:38,005
place em down over here, create a beautiful pattern,

222
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:40,127
and turn it into the outer shell of my truffle.

223
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:40,960
- Nice, well I--

224
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,793
- It'll make a lot of sense.

225
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:42,626
- Are you done?

226
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:43,459
- Yeah.

227
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,440
- For the filling of my kinder egg,

228
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,213
I'm making nutella, but better.

229
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:48,046
- How are you gonna make better than nutella, man?

230
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:49,230
- I'm gonna home-make it.

231
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,206
- And you think you're really gonna nail

232
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,164
the recipe more than the nutella brand?

233
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:54,567
- You know, when you say it like that, it sounds unlikely.

234
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:55,998
- All right, well I'm gonna continue

235
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:58,082
constructing this absolutely beautiful masterpiece here,

236
00:04:58,082 --> 00:04:59,281
and let's speed it along.

237
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:00,116
- Yo!

238
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:01,541
Wait, whoa, I switched places with Devan.

239
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,388
Wait, where'd Devan go?

240
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:03,314
- Huh, wait, what?

241
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:04,480
Why am I over here?

242
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,048
- Oh, sorry, I've gotten really rusty at this.

243
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,807
You should probably take back your sack of hazelnuts.

244
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:09,893
- Hazelnuts.

245
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,615
- I was trying to avoid that, but all right.

246
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,053
I'm gonna take this right here,

247
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:14,031
and again, I'm gonna use it

248
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:15,252
as the outer shell of my truffles.

249
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:16,261
We're gonna flip it over, here we go.

250
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,094
Three, two, one.

251
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:18,203
(screaming)

252
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:19,703
okay, there we go.

253
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,251
That's so satisfying!

254
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:23,084
- Yo, that looks cool!

255
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,703
- Wait 'til you see what I filled the interior with.

256
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:26,574
It's gonna be saucy.

257
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:28,062
- Like, is it actual sauce?

258
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,086
- It's not actual sauce, it's just going to be saucy.

259
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:30,986
- So, sauce.

260
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:32,401
Got the hazelnuts all blended up,

261
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,041
now just gonna add the chocolate.

262
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,189
- All right, for my truffle, I've got some

263
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,799
peanut butter that I'm gonna pop inside.

264
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,587
It's still got the cover on it, so here we go.

265
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:39,420
Three, two, one.

266
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,155
- [Devan] Now just gotta blend this stuff.

267
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:42,392
- Well, we've got everything we need,

268
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:43,757
so now it is time to fully put our

269
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:46,126
kinder eggs together and see their gloriousness.

270
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:48,178
We've got the kinder eggs, and dude, look at this!

271
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:49,941
This is absolutely massive!

272
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,362
- Dude, they are really heavy too.

273
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:53,007
- Exactly, so right now, we've got everything

274
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,080
we need to fill it up, but first,

275
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,444
we've got a chocolate layer, and then

276
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:57,387
a white chocolate layer we've added on top of that.

277
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:58,742
I've got some candy slime over here,

278
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:00,345
and as you know, there's going to be a surprise

279
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:02,096
inside the kinder egg, but right now,

280
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,190
let's put these together.

281
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,654
The giant kinder eggs are all made,

282
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:07,110
and bro, this is an engineering feat of genius, man!

283
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,435
Like, they are so massive!

284
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,633
- These things are huge.

285
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:10,826
- But the best part is wait 'til you see

286
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:12,913
the surprise that's on the inside, man.

287
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:14,006
Like that's really what takes

288
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,191
this whole thing to another level.

289
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:18,043
Here is the big reveal, three, two, one!

290
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,272
Tada!

291
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:20,498
Look at these, bro!

292
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:21,331
- Dude!

293
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:22,719
- These turned out to be absolutely insane!

294
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,062
So we're gonna be cracking these things open

295
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:25,538
and eating them at the end of the video.

296
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:26,922
You challenged us to make a giant Butterfinger

297
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:28,381
and Snickers bar, so let's go.

298
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:29,812
First thing I'm doing is making the inside

299
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:30,959
of my Butterfinger, so I got a whole bunch

300
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,121
of peanut butter right here.

301
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,292
- And I'm making a peanut for my snickers.

302
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,013
- I'm gonna add my peanut butter in here like this.

303
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,100
Here we go, three, two, one.

304
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,933
(grunting)

305
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:38,777
That sounded like a pterodactyl.

306
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:41,037
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

307
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:41,870
- What?

308
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,703
- There's corn syrup?

309
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:43,536
- Yeah, man!

310
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,433
- You are the worst farmer of all time, Devan.

311
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,030
You couldn't farm a peanut, you don't even know what it is.

312
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,863
- Why would I want--

313
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:47,696
No, what?

314
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:48,791
- As you can tell, we got a little bit

315
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:49,924
of peanut butter over here,

316
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:51,351
so now, I think I can move this off to the side.

317
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:52,184
- What?

318
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:53,517
Just a little bit?

319
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:56,272
- Yeah, I gotta get pumped real quick, so here we go.

320
00:06:56,272 --> 00:06:57,525
All right, there we go and then--

321
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:58,453
All right, so there we go!

322
00:06:58,453 --> 00:06:59,506
Three, two, one.

323
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:00,602
(grunting)

324
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:01,615
Easy, totally easy!

325
00:07:01,615 --> 00:07:03,153
Whoo, I feel exerted.

326
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:04,816
The whole thing with the interior of a butter finger

327
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:06,379
is you gotta make sure that it's super crunchy.

328
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,977
So, got some corn flakes here.

329
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:09,386
We got some chick-o-sticks.

330
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:11,146
Whole little tower right over here.

331
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:12,013
Stay.

332
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:13,867
I've never even like, heard of these things.

333
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,280
- Oh, they're right here too.

334
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,810
- My stick, no touching my sticks!

335
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,070
Bro!

336
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,779
Devan has butterfingers.

337
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:20,612
- Watch this.

338
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:21,445
(crashing noise)

339
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:22,278
- I'm a little scared.

340
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:23,180
- I meant to point it at you, but.

341
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,676
- I feel rather uncomfortable right now.

342
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,073
- All right, this thing is heated up,

343
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,839
now it's time to add some baking soda here.

344
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,839
- Here is Helga the hen.

345
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,486
- Whoa, yes!

346
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,284
- Gonna smash up the sticks with Helga the hen.

347
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:35,999
This is gonna act as the crunchy texture

348
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:37,120
on the inside of my butterfingers.

349
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,249
- I'm putting this into the mold here.

350
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,308
- That looks so gross.

351
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:41,141
- Collins?

352
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:41,974
- What?

353
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:42,807
- Can you help?

354
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:43,640
- I finally figured out the perfect mixture,

355
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,773
now I'm gonna pour it into the mold.

356
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:47,606
- You hold onto that for a second.

357
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:48,922
No, no, no, no, no.

358
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:49,755
- What?

359
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:50,588
Collins!

360
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:52,404
I don't wanna hold it, it's all you.

361
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:53,237
- Okay, so here, no, no, no!

362
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:55,071
We can't just set it--

363
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:57,349
And we're back to where we started.

364
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:59,294
- [Devan] Oh, wow, this is really not going in very well.

365
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:00,191
- [Collins] And that's gonna create a peanut?

366
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:01,024
- Hopefully.

367
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:02,232
- All right, here we go, just gonna scoop

368
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,069
out a little bit of peanut butter over here like this.

369
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,444
Oh, yeah, just give a nice little plop down here.

370
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:08,999
Boom, bigger scoop!

371
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:12,057
Call me the peanut butter dude!

372
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:13,247
- Haha, I don't know if I wanna call you

373
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:14,416
the peanut butter dude anymore.

374
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,431
You're like a pokemon.

375
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:17,028
They say their name before they do something.

376
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:18,845
And if you're a pokemon, that means you could be caught!

377
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:20,080
- You can't catch peanut butter dude.

378
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,057
- Oh you can't, well let's try it out!

379
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:22,438
Three, two, one!

380
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:23,398
- Ow!

381
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:24,957
Holy cow!

382
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:26,071
I almost wish I was caught,

383
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,226
'cause it probably woulda hurt less.

384
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:28,059
- Bruh.

385
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:28,892
- What?

386
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:29,725
- Can you see how slow this is going?

387
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:30,558
- Did you just say bruh?

388
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:31,391
- Bruh.

389
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:32,224
Oop, I missed.

390
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:33,432
Completely missed.

391
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:34,344
I completely missed.

392
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:35,177
- I mean, it looks kinda cool.

393
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:36,286
- It kinda looks like a goober.

394
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:37,878
Right, isn't that a fish, or something like that?

395
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:38,711
- What?

396
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:41,544
(stammering)

397
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:42,944
- It looks like one of those fishes that go.

398
00:08:42,944 --> 00:08:44,643
- Peanut butter man does not seen one of these fish before.

399
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:45,842
Next up, I gotta melt down

400
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:48,977
a whole bunch of candy corns for the caramel.

401
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:50,546
- All right, just gotta let the mold set

402
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:51,910
and then the peanut is done.

403
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,357
All right, next up, I'm making my nougat.

404
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:54,502
- To find the illusive candy corn,

405
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:58,119
I brought along the silly scissors.

406
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:58,952
- That was a voice crack?

407
00:08:58,952 --> 00:08:59,785
- Nope, that was just me.

408
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:00,658
- Okay, well, what do they do?

409
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:02,451
- They cut a hole in the space-time continuum!

410
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:03,585
So silly!

411
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,351
Time to cut open the fabric of time, you ready?

412
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:07,467
Three, two, one.

413
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:08,548
(zapping noise)

414
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,672
Oh!

415
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:10,505
Snap, yo!

416
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:12,819
- That looks like you.

417
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,029
- That looks like me.

418
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:14,877
This is alternate universe me!

419
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:15,879
- Haha, yeah.

420
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,046
- Where is the candy corn?

421
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,483
- It's been here the whole time?

422
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:23,272
Just gonna put in this marshmallow fluff here.

423
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,780
- There is one other use, and that is

424
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,421
you can use these to slice off the top

425
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:28,260
of your recently found candy corn.

426
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,243
- Just what scissors do.

427
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:31,551
- This is what I call the basketball dunk spike.

428
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:33,562
Excuse me, I'm going backwards.

429
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:34,479
All right, here we go.

430
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,687
Three, two, one, dunk!

431
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:36,520
Oh, snap!

432
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:38,792
That was pretty cool.

433
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,222
We got even more candy corns, and here we go,

434
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:41,353
gonna add that in like that.

435
00:09:41,353 --> 00:09:42,188
Boom, there we go.

436
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:43,628
Then we got this one over here.

437
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:46,453
- Are you making this on the floor, or in that?

438
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,002
- I know you're not really asking this question, Devan.

439
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:48,835
- I'm not.

440
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:49,668
- And that hurts.

441
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:50,519
I've got some dark corn syrup

442
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,038
I'm gonna add into my candy corn.

443
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:53,079
Is this gonna be the nougat?

444
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:53,912
- Yes.

445
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:56,805
- What, whoa!

446
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,916
That looks like--

447
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:58,749
- [Devan] No!

448
00:09:58,749 --> 00:09:59,582
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

449
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:00,618
I'm gonna get a new one.

450
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:01,701
- We've got the candy bar molds,

451
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,709
and the first thing I'm doing here

452
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,212
for my butterfingers is the topping.

453
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:07,483
- And the first thing I'm doing is my nougat.

454
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,131
- This is very heavy.

455
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:10,374
Three, two, one.

456
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:13,483
Oh, let's see, okay a little pour.

457
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,406
- [Devan] Look at the rolls, dude!

458
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,341
- [Collins] Dude, that looks beautiful!

459
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:18,068
Mine's actually looking pretty good as well, man.

460
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:20,056
All right, so here we go, just gonna pour this down.

461
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:21,771
- Now it's time to add the peanuts.

462
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:22,604
- [Collins] Those are the peanuts?

463
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:23,437
- Yes.

464
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:26,219
Gonna try to plop it outta here into here.

465
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,052
Yeah!

466
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:28,385
- [Collins] That looks so cool, man!

467
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:30,284
- Now it's time to add the caramel.

468
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:31,117
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

469
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:32,405
We can go at the same time!

470
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:33,238
We can be bros!

471
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:34,689
Okay, three, two, one.

472
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:38,022
Just pour it straight in the center, oh!

473
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,710
That's a lot of peanut butter.

474
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,543
- Dude!

475
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:42,446
- Time for me to get my hands in here

476
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:43,812
and kind of mix this up a little bit.

477
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:45,010
- [Devan] Wait, what?

478
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,620
- I feel like I'm doggy-paddling right now

479
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,630
to get all this stuff in here.

480
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,011
We gotta douse all of this in a lot of lovely chocolate.

481
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:51,196
But right now, we'll get it all finished up

482
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:52,387
and then it's time to see how they taste.

483
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:53,671
All right, the giant candy bars are all done.

484
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:55,446
I gotta say, I was expecting big,

485
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,935
these are massive, bro!

486
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:59,169
- These are not any normal candy bars, man.

487
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:00,002
- Oh, no.

488
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:00,835
- Holy cow!

489
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:01,668
- Trying to take a bite of these things

490
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:02,704
is gonna be next to impossible.

491
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,239
Right now here is the big reveal, three, two--

492
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,618
Wait, a three-second like challenge.

493
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:07,637
We wanna see you like this video

494
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:09,043
in three seconds, you ready?

495
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,876
Here we go, three, two, one, done.

496
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:15,021
Three, two, one.

497
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:16,303
What's up?

498
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:17,136
- I messed up.

499
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,848
- Well there's mine, reveal yours!

500
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:20,223
- Tada!

501
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:21,221
- There we go.

502
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:22,125
- You get to comment down below,

503
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,488
which one do you think will taste better,

504
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:25,348
and we'll be eating them at the end of the video.

505
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:27,835
- You challenged us to make a giant donut and nerds rope.

506
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:29,564
So the first thing I'm making for my giant donut

507
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,934
is the round donut-shaped dough.

508
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,228
- Yup, and the first thing I'm making

509
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:34,867
is the nerd of the nerd rope.

510
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:36,868
So, to make my nerd, I got a jolly rancher

511
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:38,256
on the tip of this hot straw.

512
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:39,859
Just gonna try to blow it up real quick.

513
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:40,692
- Oh no!

514
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,054
- You broke the faucet!

515
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:43,948
- I broke the faucet!

516
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:45,237
- Are you kidding me?

517
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,413
- That's an issue.

518
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,246
- Bro.

519
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,270
- This is an issue.

520
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,481
Yeah, let's just have--

521
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:51,929
- Bro, are you kidding?

522
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:53,693
- Haha, whoopsie!

523
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:54,800
I don't think it's that noticeable.

524
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,651
- Are you kidding?

525
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:57,965
I'm actually gonna use a mold instead.

526
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:59,075
That might work out better.

527
00:11:59,075 --> 00:11:59,955
- All right, all I gotta do

528
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:01,002
is just take these different cakes right here,

529
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,287
like this, just gonna let it go down and--

530
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:03,120
Devan?

531
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,953
- What?

532
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:04,786
- I need this space right here.

533
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:05,619
- Okay.

534
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:06,452
- Three, two, one, let's see.

535
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:07,812
Oh, there we go, that's what I'm talking about.

536
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,121
Sweet moves, bro.

537
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:09,991
Oh boy, yeah, this is--

538
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:11,145
- And you got it on my arm.

539
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:12,269
No!

540
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,481
I knew you wouldn't do it.

541
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:14,314
- My commitment level is weak.

542
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:15,306
- So, before I do this, I have

543
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:16,726
to wash my hands, but Collins?

544
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:17,559
- What?

545
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,762
- I would normally wash my hands right here.

546
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:19,775
But now, I have to go all the way

547
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:21,599
over there to wash my hands.

548
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:22,947
Look what you've done to me, bro.

549
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:24,155
- I'm sorry.

550
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:25,485
It was the cakes, man!

551
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:26,318
- Shame.

552
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:27,151
- Blame them!

553
00:12:27,151 --> 00:12:29,156
- I'm all the way over here, washing my hands,

554
00:12:29,156 --> 00:12:31,232
and I'm totally separated from the action!

555
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:32,439
- Yeah, you can't even see how cool

556
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:34,054
my donut is starting to look, man!

557
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,637
- Actually, I can see it.

558
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:36,649
- Well, what do you think?

559
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:37,627
(laughs nervously)

560
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:38,460
- It's looking good.

561
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,599
- What was that laugh?

562
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,403
- All right, so I've melted down the jolly ranchers,

563
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:43,177
now I've gotta pour em into the molds.

564
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:45,520
- While you do that, time for me to move my donut over here!

565
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,073
I tried to talk normal, but that is

566
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,468
a very heavy donut right now.

567
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,103
So, next up I've gotta make some cotton candy

568
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,506
for the toppings on my donut.

569
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,747
All right, here we go, cotton candy machine is turned on.

570
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:56,973
- [Devan] Just pouring it into the mold here.

571
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:58,104
- Let's see if this works, here we go.

572
00:12:58,104 --> 00:13:00,421
You ready, three, two, one.

573
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:01,995
Whoa!

574
00:13:01,995 --> 00:13:02,828
Yo!

575
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:03,680
- Yes!

576
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,513
- Wait a minute!

577
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:05,346
This is what I'm talking about!

578
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,725
- [Devan] This is the real stuff, dude!

579
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:09,252
- Yeah, man!

580
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:11,137
Look at that sight!

581
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:11,970
- Calm, calm, calm.

582
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,803
That was too much.

583
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:13,739
All right, it's gonna just take way too long

584
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:16,067
to cool this stuff down, so I'm gonna use liquid nitrogen.

585
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,830
- Okay, don't try this at home, by the way.

586
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,266
I think the cotton candy was much cooler,

587
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,904
just saying, just putting that out there.

588
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,225
Can you do this with liquid nitrogen?

589
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:23,058
Boom!

590
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:24,022
- It's always the coolest.

591
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:24,999
Did you get that?

592
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:25,998
It's really cold.

593
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:26,831
- It was a joke.

594
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:29,039
Next, I'm gonna use a little bronca-ya-jus-just--

595
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,923
Bronca-saura-donk, banca-donka-donka-brunkis.

596
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:33,802
You got it, here we go, three, two, one.

597
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:35,530
Just gonna pour it in like this, here we go.

598
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,363
- Okay, do I just hold it here?

599
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:37,196
- Yeah, there we go.

600
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,104
Oh, no, no, gotta catch this!

601
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:39,266
Yep, keep it going!

602
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:40,099
- [Devan] Do I spin it?

603
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:40,932
- Yeah, just keep spinning it.

604
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:41,765
I think we're reaching the limits

605
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:43,201
of what the bronky-donkyus can hold.

606
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:44,591
This will be perfect for the top of my donut.

607
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,552
- This looks like a wand with a spell on the end of it.

608
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:48,385
- Yeah right, man.

609
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:51,500
- Abra-cadabra, you shall never do the dab again, bro!

610
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,333
- What?

611
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,166
That's not a real spell.

612
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,333
- Yes, try it.

613
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:57,876
Uh-huh, I told you, bro.

614
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,710
- Third time's the charm.

615
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,654
- Oh man!

616
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:01,947
If that's what happened if he tried to dab,

617
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:03,778
I'd hate to see what happened if he tried to floss.

618
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:05,302
All right, so now we got these two halves,

619
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,060
it's time to heat these things up and fuse them together.

620
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,690
- Sorry about that, man.

621
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,567
Okay, caught a couple of peeps.

622
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:12,567
Wait, I wonder if this works with other stuff,

623
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:13,825
like hot cheetos for instance.

624
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:15,658
Let's try it, here we go.

625
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:16,608
Nope, more peeps.

626
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:18,505
It's infinite peeps.

627
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:20,214
- All right, so, why are you using these things, Collins?

628
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:21,815
(crickets chirping)

629
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:22,648
- That's a good question.

630
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:24,028
Oh, sorry, to make a topping for my donut.

631
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,535
- This is made now, now it's time to move onto the rope.

632
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:28,718
- This ain't made, this is wack.

633
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:29,563
Well right now, it's the moment

634
00:14:29,563 --> 00:14:30,424
I've always been waiting for,

635
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:31,874
time to yeet 150 chicks at once.

636
00:14:31,874 --> 00:14:33,386
Yeet!

637
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:34,974
Picked up 15 chicks just like that.

638
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,456
- And I'm just picking up a big tube I made here.

639
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:38,642
- What did, where?

640
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,212
- This is for my nerd rope, bro.

641
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,431
- No, where did that come from?

642
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:42,693
- Collins, we aren't playing around.

643
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,162
- Devan, on a real note, where did that come from?

644
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:46,042
- From the ground, it's been there the whole time.

645
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,106
- I literally didn't see it at all.

646
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:47,979
(gasps)

647
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:49,477
(stammers)

648
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:51,635
Gosh, it's so tough to open, holy cow.

649
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:52,497
- I thought you were strong.

650
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:53,751
I thought you could pick up 100 chicks.

651
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:54,584
- 150.

652
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:56,163
Whoa, peep slide, bam!

653
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,188
Tilt it!

654
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,880
Look at that, bro!

655
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,380
You just made that peep's day.

656
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,586
- I hate to say it, but this peep is about to be eaten.

657
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:08,138
You do not wanna give this thing life and a name.

658
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:09,502
- That's so dark.

659
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:10,633
- All right, so I'm gonna fill this thing up

660
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,282
with some jello, then let it set.

661
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:13,115
Three, two, one.

662
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:14,534
Okay, it's going in.

663
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:15,414
- I can't see anything.

664
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,609
- All right, there we go, got one.

665
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:17,689
Hold up, stay there.

666
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:18,663
- Bumped me.

667
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:20,085
I don't understand why I'm always being bumped.

668
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:20,918
- Karma.

669
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:21,751
Pouring this one in here.

670
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:23,100
All right, you're gonna let go on the count of three.

671
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,195
Here we go, three.

672
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:26,130
- No more three, two, ones!

673
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,146
We are banning three, two, ones on the channel!

674
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:29,300
- Oh wait, but first!

675
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,857
(laughing)

676
00:15:30,857 --> 00:15:31,690
Sweet baby Yoda.

677
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,987
Well, time for me to mash up a whole bunch of peeps!

678
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,547
- Next up, I am making a red nerd

679
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:38,761
with a red apple, some candy melt here, and some nerds.

680
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:40,054
- I think these peeps are gonna act

681
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:41,996
as a lovely texture for the topping of my donut, man.

682
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:42,829
- Lovely.

683
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:44,143
Beautiful, glorious.

684
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:44,976
- It is.

685
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:45,809
Kinda disturbing, I've got like

686
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,387
a peep's eye just chilling on my hand.

687
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:48,936
- Hey man, that's a little dark, don't you think?

688
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:50,053
- I got peep vision now.

689
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:51,553
- Whoa, wow, okay.

690
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:54,872
Whoa, getting a little close there, bro.

691
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,595
- So it's basically like a candy apple, man?

692
00:15:56,595 --> 00:15:58,198
- Kind of.

693
00:15:58,198 --> 00:15:59,888
I got a bunch of different flavor profiles, you know?

694
00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:01,552
(spatting noises)

695
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:03,392
- You shoulda just poured the whole box on it, man.

696
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:04,739
It's like you break open a box of nerds.

697
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:06,275
Ooh, missed that.

698
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,886
- Collins, I think the key point is you don't break it!

699
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,115
- There we go.

700
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:10,952
- Collins!

701
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:12,587
You're not supposed to break it, you're supposed to open it.

702
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:13,755
There you go, there you go, there you go.

703
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:14,695
That was like, nothing.

704
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:16,537
- Exactly, they must be filled with air.

705
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:18,561
- It's almost like you smashed it on the counter

706
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,509
and lost everything that was inside.

707
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:21,807
- I don't know why you would think that, man.

708
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:24,478
This just in, nerd boxes are filled with 90 percent air,

709
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:26,450
and only ten percent candy.

710
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,852
- Wait, wait, wait, dude, we don't wanna get sued.

711
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:28,941
You can't say that.

712
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:29,774
- Okay, yes.

713
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:30,607
- You can't say that.

714
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:31,440
- Just kidding, fake news!

715
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,273
- Exactly.

716
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:33,106
- Back to you Patricia!

717
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:34,204
Okay, right now it's time for me to glaze my donut.

718
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:36,313
- And time for me to finish up my nerds rope.

719
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:37,441
What are you saying, dude?

720
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:39,024
(grunting)

721
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,774
- What is that?

722
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:42,570
I've got the glaze, bro, you gotta chill.

723
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,903
Three, two, one.

724
00:16:45,193 --> 00:16:47,640
- Oh, that's a good coat, man.

725
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,152
- That looks chunky!

726
00:16:49,152 --> 00:16:50,928
- It looks like a smoothie.

727
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:51,761
Oh no!

728
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:52,718
It's going down the front of the table, dude!

729
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:55,261
I just gotta remove this nerds rope.

730
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:56,475
- Oh my gosh, dude!

731
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,686
- Yes, wait, hold it, hold it!

732
00:16:57,686 --> 00:16:58,684
- This is so dope, bro!

733
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,686
Time to finish things up, and then

734
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,700
we're gonna be eating em.

735
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,858
Giant candies are done, and bro,

736
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,446
that nerds rope is absolutely insane.

737
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:05,780
- It is massive, bro.

738
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,548
- Like, the nerds are larger than my fist, bro.

739
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:08,381
- Seriously.

740
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:09,276
- And this donut, I gotta say,

741
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:10,879
I think it's 800 pounds, to be honest.

742
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:11,712
- It's pretty huge.

743
00:17:11,712 --> 00:17:12,655
- I've had a lot of trouble lifting it.

744
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:14,103
So here is the big reveal.

745
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:15,215
Three, two--

746
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:16,415
Oh, wait, five-second subscribe challenge.

747
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:17,722
We wanna see if you can subscribe to the channel

748
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:20,929
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

749
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:21,789
Are you ready?

750
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:22,622
Here we go.

751
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:25,455
Five, four, three, two, one, done.

752
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,265
If you were able to do that,

753
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:29,823
comment down below Keyper squad right now,

754
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:30,881
and let's see how these turned out.

755
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:32,714
Three, two, one, tada!

756
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,197
Look at these giant candies!

757
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:37,245
Finally time to eat the giant snickers bar

758
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:38,591
and the giant butterfingers.

759
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,974
So Devan, which one should we eat first?

760
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:41,846
This whack, square-looking snickers bar,

761
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:44,329
or the beautiful, shapely butterfinger?

762
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,473
It's the shape you want.

763
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:46,336
- All right, let's do yours first.

764
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:47,169
- Thanks.

765
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:48,573
- Let's be disappointed, together.

766
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:50,351
- So, to cut it open, I've got an ax right over here.

767
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:51,184
- Are you kidding?

768
00:17:51,184 --> 00:17:52,017
- Here's the thing.

769
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:52,850
If you you ever got a giant candy bar,

770
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,683
do not try this at home.

771
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:56,110
Just gonna kinda give it like a downward dog.

772
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,784
Here we go, three, two, one.

773
00:17:57,784 --> 00:17:58,688
- Wow.

774
00:17:58,688 --> 00:17:59,521
- Okay.

775
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:00,509
- [Devan] Dude, yes!

776
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:01,342
- Holy cow!

777
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:02,175
- [Devan] That works!

778
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:03,258
- Boom, boom!

779
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,287
Yeah!

780
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:06,867
Ax-man, I'm the ax-man!

781
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,815
- I won't, I won't.

782
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:10,047
- And don't worry, we will not be eating

783
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,880
all of this by ourselves.

784
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,153
We'll be sharing with our friends and family.

785
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:15,552
Holy cow, this actually looks really, really, wow!

786
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,696
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

787
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:17,529
- What, what, what, what, what?

788
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,698
- Use your own fork and grab your own piece of the bar.

789
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:19,833
- My fork is on the floor.

790
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,666
- Well, it was your decision.

791
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,662
- [Devan] Just gonna grab off.

792
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:22,639
- So, you're the first one to get

793
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:23,515
the feeling of the texture.

794
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:24,348
What does it feel like?

795
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:25,181
- Yeah, terrible.

796
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:26,014
- Let's see how it tastes.

797
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:26,847
Ready, here we go.

798
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:28,180
Three, two, one.

799
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:31,844
Whoa.

800
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,761
It tastes like a butterfinger, man!

801
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,572
It can't be that bad.

802
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:37,908
What, it's that bad?

803
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,270
- It tastes great, but wow, is it crunchy!

804
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,561
- Well, yeah, it's all about that crunch.

805
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:43,894
So, I think I have a strong chance

806
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:45,265
of winning this round, but Devan--

807
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:46,598
- So do I.

808
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:47,934
- I like that.

809
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:48,767
- I mean, no.

810
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:51,460
I'm actually going to undo it from the back here,

811
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,266
and do a nice little reveal.

812
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,360
- Don't worry about me.

813
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,779
Tada!

814
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:57,612
- [Devan] Yeah!

815
00:18:57,612 --> 00:18:58,445
- [Collins] Look at that!

816
00:18:58,445 --> 00:18:59,278
- Yeah, the back's not so great,

817
00:18:59,278 --> 00:19:00,995
but, you know, the front looks pretty good.

818
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:02,785
I have no idea how I'm gonna cut through this.

819
00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:03,892
- [Collins] You need a bigger knife.

820
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,648
(elevator music)

821
00:19:05,648 --> 00:19:07,010
Three, two, one.

822
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,512
Oh, oh, it's going!

823
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,408
It's happening, it's happening!

824
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:11,353
Look at that!

825
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:13,009
Holy cow!

826
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:14,028
It's beautiful.

827
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:14,861
- It looks great.

828
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:16,319
- I might actually cry.

829
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,530
- Okay, maybe don't cry.

830
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,721
Just gonna pull down here, yes!

831
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:21,684
Got some of that off.

832
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:22,517
That's a chunk of chocolate.

833
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:23,724
- That's like a full chocolate bar, normally.

834
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:25,190
So, I'm gonna take this little piece of chocolate

835
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,271
over here, I'm gonna be tasteful.

836
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:27,936
All right, I'm gonna place this down and layer--

837
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:29,080
(grunting)

838
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,913
- Yes!

839
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:30,746
I just wanted to do that.

840
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:31,579
- Holy cow.

841
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:32,412
(yelling)

842
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:33,399
- I want the peanut.

843
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:35,770
- It's definitely wedged deep in the crevasse.

844
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,645
Hey, don't bring that up.

845
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:37,669
- All right, here we go.

846
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:39,002
Three, two, one.

847
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:44,471
Whoa!

848
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:45,560
- The peanut is too hard.

849
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,643
- Whoa, whoa!

850
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:52,759
Are you kidding me?

851
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,592
You crushed it, bro!

852
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,056
Creme de la awesome.

853
00:19:55,056 --> 00:19:56,433
Well, as you can tell, my egg

854
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:57,551
is starting to fall apart, so now

855
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:58,637
it is time to crack it open.

856
00:19:58,637 --> 00:20:01,304
So, here we go, three, two, one.

857
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,079
We have made it into the egg.

858
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,335
Here it goes, we're moving pieces.

859
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:09,355
Tada!

860
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:10,188
- Wow.

861
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:11,992
- First, take a look at the surprise on the inside.

862
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:13,443
It's got a balloon in it, here we go.

863
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:16,928
Oh, it's getting a little bit stuck.

864
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:17,820
All right, so this is the surprise

865
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,035
that Devan made for me on the inside.

866
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:19,868
- Yes.

867
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:20,701
- What is it?

868
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,534
- You can't tell, dude?

869
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:22,367
- Well, it looks like a little

870
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,200
jet-engine-propelled telephone.

871
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,054
No, no, this is how you handle customer service calls, man.

872
00:20:25,054 --> 00:20:27,064
Hey, so my car phone isn't working, and I'm mad.

873
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:29,654
- It's a car, Collins, but it's okay.

874
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:30,487
- I think you should probably grab

875
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:31,320
like a slab of chocolate first.

876
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,003
Let's try to remove that ball.

877
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:33,836
It's like a game show.

878
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:35,352
Remove that ball!

879
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:36,475
Oh, yep, this is nice.

880
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:39,411
♪ Scoop-de-doop-doop-Doop ♪

881
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:40,244
Okay, there we go.

882
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:41,077
- [Devan] You got it.

883
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:42,192
- It's been scoopa-dee-doo--

884
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:43,178
♪ De doop doop doop ♪

885
00:20:43,178 --> 00:20:44,011
Wanna cheers it first?

886
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:44,844
- Sure.

887
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:47,302
Three, two, one.

888
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,679
- Whoa.

889
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:51,895
This thing here--

890
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:53,466
(evil laugh)

891
00:20:53,466 --> 00:20:56,342
- That tasted like a sandwich with chocolate!

892
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:57,586
- That was pretty phenomenal, man.

893
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:58,419
- I agree.

894
00:20:58,419 --> 00:20:59,268

combined with peanut butter and jelly,

896
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:02,372
the chocolate on the outside.

897
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:03,244
Woohoo!

898
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:04,286
- All right, let's do this thing.

899
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:05,119
You ready?

900
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:05,952
- You want me to help out at all?

901
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:06,785
- Yeah, definitely.

902
00:21:06,785 --> 00:21:07,618
- Do it with the spoons.

903
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:08,451
- That's what I'm gonna do.

904
00:21:08,451 --> 00:21:09,284
Three, two, one.

905
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:11,180
Oh, it's very soft.

906
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,998
- I gotta say, this is a resilient egg, bro.

907
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:13,831
- It is, man.

908
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:14,664
I make em good!

909
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:15,885
- I smack it, I smack it hard!

910
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:16,796
- Three, two, one.

911
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:17,752
- Karate chop!

912
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:18,585
Ow.

913
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:19,418
- Tada!

914
00:21:19,418 --> 00:21:21,027
- These truffles look pretty delicious, bro.

915
00:21:21,027 --> 00:21:22,927
- Yeah, they look a little dented though.

916
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:24,655
Honestly might've been your spoon.

917
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:25,911
- Couldn't have been.

918
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:26,897
- I think it was.

919
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:27,730
- I don't think it was.

920
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,669
- What should we serve us first?

921
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:29,504
- The surprise!

922
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:30,736
- Wait, it has a rope on it?

923
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:31,854
- Yeah, well I don't know if it'll get--

924
00:21:31,854 --> 00:21:33,645
It makes sense with the whole thing.

925
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:34,708
- A pendulum.

926
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,590
You're getting sleepy.

927
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,423
Hold onto this.

928
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:38,608
- Okay, cool, here we go.

929
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:40,187
Two things here it's a climbing man.

930
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:41,143
- Oh!

931
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:41,983
- He can climb the rope!

932
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:42,816
See, look at that.

933
00:21:42,816 --> 00:21:43,649
- Look at that!

934
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:44,482
- Boom!

935
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:45,315
- He's getting to my hand.

936
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:46,656
- So right now it's time to taste the delicious kinder egg.

937
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:50,059
- I think you take one of these massive truffles.

938
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:50,892
- Don't touch, it's mine.

939
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,350
- What are you doing?

940
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,183
- That's mine.

941
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:54,516
Okay, so listen.

942
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:57,349
Oh, that's uncomfortable.

943
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,682
It's like reaching into a pudding.

944
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:01,390
- Yeah, there you go.

945
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,223
- Ba-bam!

946
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:03,082
You need to move yours off to the side.

947
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:03,915
- Move my egg?

948
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:04,748
What are you doing?

949
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:05,581
- I help with my foot.

950
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:08,784
(crashing noise)

951
00:22:08,784 --> 00:22:09,617
Okay, well I'm gonna try right here.

952
00:22:09,617 --> 00:22:10,450
Three, two, one.

953
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,976
Oh!

954
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:12,809
Look at that!

955
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:13,642
- Yo!

956
00:22:13,642 --> 00:22:14,475
Yes!

957
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:16,031
Three, two, one.

958
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:17,460
Oh!

959
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,293
- No!

960
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:19,126
- That was close.

961
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:19,959
- That scared me.

962
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:20,792
I feel like you're doing something wrong.

963
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,253
- I made these things, bro.

964
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,626
I know what I'm doing, I think.

965
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:24,459
- I don't think so.

966
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,292
I have it already open.

967
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:29,203
You hurt your pride more than your fingers.

968
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:30,221
- [Devan] Yeah!

969
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,068
- [Collins] There you go!

970
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:32,117
- Look at that, man!

971
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,342
Remember I got those geodes on the inside.

972
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:35,175
- Oh!

973
00:22:35,175 --> 00:22:36,008
- Yeah!

974
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:37,993
- Oh, dude, I'm over here looking like a prehistoric dude.

975
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:39,053
Three, two, one.

976
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:40,620
Oh!

977
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,040
- [Devan] That looks so cool, man!

978
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,457
- Here we go, brute strength.

979
00:22:47,656 --> 00:22:48,489
Boom!

980
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:52,013
Why does mine look so much whacker than yours?

981
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:53,450
- I'm gonna dip it into here a little bit.

982
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,393
All right, here we go.

983
00:22:54,393 --> 00:22:55,726
Three, two, one.

984
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:00,205
This is so good!

985
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:01,866
Holy cow!

986
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:02,840
Wow.

987
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,621
Our friends are gonna love this.

988
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:06,188
- If you were only able to eat

989
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:07,406
one of these giant kinder eggs,

990
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:08,433
which one would you wanna eat?

991
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:09,764
Let us know in the comments down below,

992
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,279
and we're onto the next giant candy.

993
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:12,251
We've got the giant donut,

994
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:14,016
and the absolutely insane nerds rope.

995
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:15,919
Devan, which one should we eat first?

996
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,481
I think let's do yours.

997
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:18,314
- All right, so here's the thing.

998
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,063
I'm gonna lift it up, you're gonna give it a slice, okay?

999
00:23:20,063 --> 00:23:21,994
- Wait, wait, wait, where, where?

1000
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:22,934
(yells)

1001
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:23,767
- [Collins] Don't try this at home.

1002
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:24,871
I don't know why you would, or how you would.

1003
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,004
- Why is it blue, dude?

1004
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,459
- You should never cut towards the person.

1005
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,793
- This looks gross.

1006
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:29,931
- Forget this, yeah, wow.

1007
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:31,524
- That looks like soggy bread.

1008
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:32,664
- Well, that's kinda actually what is was.

1009
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:33,566
- I'm a little queasy.

1010
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:34,399
- Man up.

1011
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:35,232
Grab a fork.

1012
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:36,065
- Bring it on, brother.

1013
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:36,898
- Clink it.

1014
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:37,731
I want the pink!

1015
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:39,893
I'm gonna take off, here we go, boom.

1016
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:40,983
One of these cotton candy balls.

1017
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:42,421
And then put the peeps on the top.

1018
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,254
- You crazy.

1019
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:44,134
- Whoo, it's falling apart!

1020
00:23:44,134 --> 00:23:45,001
- Are you ready to go, dude?

1021
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:45,834
You're stalling.

1022
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,300
- All right, yep here we go, can't wait.

1023
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,024
Three, two--

1024
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:50,209
Wait, if you wanna win a 15 minute video call

1025
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:53,788
with Devan and I, text the word best to 81800 right now.

1026
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:55,248
After the video.

1027
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:57,205
Text the word best to 81800.

1028
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:58,789
You will automatically be entered in to win.

1029
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:00,268
Let's see how this tastes.

1030
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:01,601
Three, two, one.

1031
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:05,393
- Dude, this is so good!

1032
00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:11,555
You got a big peep in your mouth.

1033
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:12,388
Way to go, man!

1034
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:13,563
So many different flavors, this thing--

1035
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:15,353
- It just tasted so good, man!

1036
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,186
- So good!

1037
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:17,492
- I am over the moon with my creation.

1038
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:18,748
- Wow, now it's time for the main event.

1039
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,246
So, Collins, can you move your donut?

1040
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:21,671
- Devan, can you move my donut?

1041
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:22,504
'Cause I can't.

1042
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,337
- It's your donut.

1043
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,170
- I'm not strong enough.

1044
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,626
- I'll give it a shot.

1045
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:26,459
- Lift it all the way up.

1046
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:27,306
Are you actually able to lift this thing?

1047
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:28,139
- I think so.

1048
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:28,972
- Holy cow.

1049
00:24:28,972 --> 00:24:29,805
Need more leverage?

1050
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:30,638
- Yes, okay!

1051
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:31,471
- Holy cow!

1052
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,304
Dude!

1053
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,137
- That was definitely very heavy.

1054
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:33,970
So, I'm just gonna cut a small part

1055
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,309
right in the middle here.

1056
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,751
- What about me, what do I do?

1057
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:38,288
- I actually cut yours, do you wanna cut mine?

1058
00:24:38,288 --> 00:24:40,057
- That would be a pleasure and an absolute honor.

1059
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:41,912
- Man, these knives are really blunt.

1060
00:24:41,912 --> 00:24:43,396
- Yep, they are definitely not sharpened.

1061
00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:45,137
- You might wanna not cut so fast.

1062
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:46,158
Reveal the toothpicks.

1063
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:47,337
- Check it out, I'm a magician.

1064
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:48,441
It's gone.

1065
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:50,073
- This is the nerds rope here.

1066
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,157
- Another toothpick!

1067
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,618
- I couldn't make it stick, all right?

1068
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:54,037
And remember, I made a bunch

1069
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:55,892
of different nerds with different flavors.

1070
00:24:55,892 --> 00:24:57,969
This was cheese popcorn dipped in--

1071
00:24:57,969 --> 00:24:59,930
What are you doing?

1072
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:00,763
- I want that.

1073
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:02,556
- So I'm just gonna break this guy in half.

1074
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:03,531
Wow.

1075
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:04,732
- Ooh, that was good.

1076
00:25:04,732 --> 00:25:05,565
- We gotta split this in half.

1077
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:06,398
You know what, I'm just gonna pull it apart.

1078
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:07,686
Just say some words man, fill the time.

1079
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:10,101
- So, Devan's clearly struggling so hard right now.

1080
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:11,405
Your hands have been all over that.

1081
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:12,386
I don't even wanna eat that anymore.

1082
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,658
I'ma slice off a new piece for myself.

1083
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:14,491
- Are you kidding?

1084
00:25:14,491 --> 00:25:15,324
This is really not easy, bro.

1085
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:16,474
That took you like a solid--

1086
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:17,307
- Oh!

1087
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,674
- What, what, what, what, what?

1088
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:19,861
- Little bit of a oopsie.

1089
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:20,944
- [Devan] No!

1090
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:23,706
- That's not rubbing away.

1091
00:25:23,706 --> 00:25:25,018
- Let's get into it, man.

1092
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:25,851
Let's eat this thing.

1093
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:27,184
Three, two, one.

1094
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:30,457
(mumbles with mouth full)

1095
00:25:30,457 --> 00:25:32,749
- Okay, that one was good.

1096
00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:33,582
Very good.

1097
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:34,415
- They're really good.

1098
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:35,715
- I mean it's like, it's a rock.

1099
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:38,902
You choose your life, but all together, good.

1100
00:25:38,902 --> 00:25:40,604
- Dude, all of the flavor profiles

1101
00:25:40,604 --> 00:25:42,663
in this thing were insane!

1102
00:25:42,663 --> 00:25:43,538
- That purple one!

1103
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:45,724
- I know, but seriously, all these were delicious.

1104
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:46,628
- Even the popcorn.

1105
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,226
The flavor profiles were definitely on another level.

1106
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:50,990
Don't worry, we won't be eating all this by ourselves.

1107
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,823
We're gonna be sharing all of it

1108
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:52,789
with our friends and families.

1109
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:53,804
So, you get to comment down below,

1110
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:55,492
if you had to eat one of these giant candies,

1111
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:56,678
which one would it be?

1112

You got five seconds, here we go.

1114

Five, four, three, two, one, done.

1115
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:04,603
Love you, bye!
