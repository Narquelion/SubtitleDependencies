1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
- What's up guys?

2
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:03,746
It is Collins Key and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:05,651
Now, after my previous sibling tag

4
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:07,141
with my little brother, Devan,

5
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,203
everyone was like commenting, requesting for him

6
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:10,299
to be in another video.

7
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:11,722
So, here he is.

8
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:12,739
- [Both] Ey!

9
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:13,572
- Whaddup?

10
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:15,030
- Oh.

11
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,424
- See how you miss the high-fives.

12
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:17,989
- Yeah, you always look for the elbow.

13
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:18,824
(laughing)

14
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:19,816
- Alright, I'm ready.

15
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:20,948
- Today, we are going to be doing

16
00:00:20,948 --> 00:00:22,488
the sibling test challenge.

17
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:25,358
So basically, we've each written down a list of questions

18
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,602
that we should know about each other.

19
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:29,054
Every question that we get wrong,

20
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:30,938
the other person gets to throw an egg at us.

21
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:31,771
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

22
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:32,604
- Okay.

23
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:33,553
â™« Rock, paper, scissors

24
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:34,386
Darn it!

25
00:00:34,386 --> 00:00:35,219
I go first.

26
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,839
What was my first drawing ever?

27
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:40,325
- A classical reproduction of a Leonardo DiCaprio painting.

28
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:41,783
- Nailed it.

29
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:42,949
It was not. - What was it?

30
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:43,784
- It was a scribble.

31
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:45,562
- That's not an actual drawing.

32
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:48,034
Anyone can say, my first drawing was a scribble.

33
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,719
If it was like a scribble with an intention,

34
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,552
that's a drawing.

35
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:52,125
What's one specific quality

36
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,871
or attribute I look for in a girl?

37
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:54,883
- Eyes? - There's two.

38
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:57,467
I like eyes and I like a girl with a cool smile.

39
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:58,300
- Okay.

40
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,148
- I like girls with a nice smile.

41
00:00:59,148 --> 00:01:03,280
- What trick could I never do on my scooter?

42
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,113
- Tail whip.

43
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:04,946
- Darn it!

44
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:06,930
- Dude these are so easy.

45
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,233
Name one pet peeve of mine.

46
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:10,316
- Nose hairs.

47
00:01:10,316 --> 00:01:11,149
(laughs)

48
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:12,091
- Out of nowhere?

49
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:14,141
When have I ever expressed a disliking or pet peeve-ishness

50
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,647
for nose hairs? - Maybe that was his head.

51
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:17,230
- Yeah.

52
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,393
What was my favorite to draw when I was eight?

53
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:20,335
- The booty.

54
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:21,168
- No.

55
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:22,001
It was not the booty.

56
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:23,016
Yoda, in battle.

57
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,832
- Really? - With light sabers that--

58
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:26,704
- This one's super easy but if I could be an animal,

59
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:27,810
what animal would I be?

60
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,893
- A squirrel.

61
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:32,364
What was my first still-life drawing of?

62
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:33,337
- A naked person.

63
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:34,170
- Nope. - Dang it.

64
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,003
- That's not a still life--

65
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:35,836
- He has drawn naked people though.

66
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:37,633
- That's a life drawing thing.

67
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:38,466
It's not, it's--

68
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:39,299
- You've drawn naked people though?

69
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,453
(laughing) - Yes, I have.

70
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:43,752
- Like he has drawn nude people.

71
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:45,325
- Alright, so moving on,

72
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:46,285
it was a still-life.

73
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:47,444
It was a pear.

74
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:48,552
- A pear? - What?

75
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:50,956
- What was the name of my first magic book?

76
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:51,789
- Mark...

77
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:56,075
Let me (mumbles)

78
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,165
(laughs)

79
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:57,998
I can't--

80
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:59,236
This one's hard.

81
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:01,681
This one's really hard.

82
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:03,915
Something complete guide to magic.

83
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,748
- You didn't even get it right.

84
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:06,459
It's Mark Wilson's Complete Course in Magic.

85
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,292
- Wilson!

86
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,395
(screams) - Dude.

87
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,039
- Who was my favorite Japanese comic book artist?

88
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,064
- Ukazima Mishagawa.

89
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:15,235
(laughs)

90
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,769
- That wasn't even a real guess.

91
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,675
- Morigato Shugesaya.

92
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:19,508
Naruto.

93
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:20,675
Naruto, shuriken.

94
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,018
I don't know, I'll give it one more shot.

95
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:23,906
Ugize Zimbabwe.

96
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:24,739
- Okay, no.

97
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:26,138
When I was 10, it was--

98
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:26,971
Hold on.

99
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:29,130
- (laughs) And you don't even know bro, come on.

100
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,612
- Takeshi Obata, I think.

101
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:33,445
I'm not sure.

102
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,017
- What position do I sleep in?

103
00:02:35,017 --> 00:02:37,219
- On your left side.

104
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:38,177
- No.

105
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:39,010
- What?

106
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,190
- Face down, booty up.

107
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,404
And I sleep with my arm like this.

108
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:42,400
If your arm was like a pillow.

109
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,634
It's like (sighs).

110
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:46,718
Right now, I could have pulled down my pants

111
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:48,050
and you guys won't even know it.

112
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,318
- He just did.

113
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:50,151
- You don't even know though.

114
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:51,911
He could be lying to yo.

115
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,097
(laughing)

116
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:55,175
Where was my first Instagram picture taken?

117
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,529
While you're waiting for him to figure it out,

118
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:57,477
you might as well go check it out.

119
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,416
My Instagram is @CollinsKey , see what my first--

120
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,362
Hey! - Hey, mom.

121
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:02,195
- Who's that?

122
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:03,028
Hey mom.

123
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:03,891
We're over here. - Did you bring food?

124
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:04,776
- Yeah, did you have food?

125
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:05,683
- Yeah. - Do you have food?

126
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:06,516
- What is that?

127
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:07,677
What's in the paper bag mom? - Food.

128
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:08,510
- Is that food?

129
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,218
We'll be right back.

130
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:11,644
Sorry guys had to take a little break

131
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:13,447
to get a little bit of snackage, you know.

132
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:15,644
- What game have you always beaten me at?

133
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:16,682
- Imma go with Battlefront.

134
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:17,515
- Nope.

135
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:18,348
It was chess.

136
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:20,872
- How many times have I injured my fingers?

137
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:22,176
Like serious injuries.

138
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,009
- Once.

139
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:23,842
- Nope.

140
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:24,675
Five times.

141
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:25,637
- Five times? - Yeah.

142
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:27,042
When I fractured my pinky,

143
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,078
stung by a bee on my middle finger.

144
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,831
- That's not a serious injury.

145
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:31,664
- Yes it is.

146
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:32,497
- That is not.

147
00:03:32,497 --> 00:03:34,923
- I dropped a burning hot pan while pulling out

148
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,482
of the oven on my finger, it burned.

149
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,315
- It's not. - I got--

150
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:38,502
Yeah, that's a serious in--

151
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:39,412
For your fingers.

152
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:41,101
- Dude, I did that to my lip once.

153
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:42,115
Do you remember that?

154
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:44,000
I was eating a piece of pizza and (grunts)

155
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,125
and I think the cheese just like, fupam!

156
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,153
And it was like swollen.

157
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:48,978
- I'm not saying like life threatening--

158
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,811
- Bruh.

159
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,644
Bruh. - Okay.

160
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:51,477
Oh, I'm gonna sneeze.

161
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:52,331
(sneezing) - Yeah, turn up the death!

162
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,629
I was trying to do it like the beat drop.

163
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:55,334
- I slammed my finger in a door.

164
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:56,956
- Everyone does that!

165
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:59,410
- I mean, seriously slammed it.

166
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,243
Fine.

167
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:01,915
- So you only had like two.

168
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:02,789
(laughs)

169
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:05,997
- Who was my favorite character in Spiderman?

170
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,108
And it's not the obvious.

171
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:08,941
- Venom.

172
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:10,616
(laughs)

173
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:11,791
- Nope, it's Spiderman.

174
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,688
(laughs)

175
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,011
- That's stupid.

176
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,858
- It's all about perception.

177
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,568
The obvious could be like a villain.

178
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:19,655
- No it couldn't. - That's like--

179
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:21,392
- The one obvious person in Spiderman

180
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:22,225
and that is Spiderman.

181
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:24,643
- You didn't say the right answers so you got it wrong.

182
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:26,249
- What was my favorite-- (laughs)

183
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:27,082
What was my--

184
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:28,406
(laughs) My god.

185
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:29,239
What was my fave--

186
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,072
Dude.

187
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:32,323
What was my favorite event when I did gymnastics?

188
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:33,323
- The floor!

189
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:35,364
- No.

190
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:36,197
High bar.

191
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:37,030
- What? - Yup.

192
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,197
Like this video right now if you want to see us juggle.

193
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,679
Your juggling is so sporadic.

194
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,812
Oh really?

195
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:46,645
Oh really?

196
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:48,910

198
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:50,576
Ah!

199
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:51,567

201
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,233
That kinda hurt.

00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,066
Dude 'cause you got me with this fucking--

00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,633

208
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,498
portion of this video, now it's time to go outside.

209
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:05,568
And throw them eggs.

210
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:07,203
And it's the part you've all been waiting for.

211
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:10,088
Watching Devan and I annihilate each other with eggs.

212
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:11,192
