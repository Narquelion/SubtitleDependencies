1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:00,900
- What's up, guys?

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,772
I'm Collins Key, and I'm here in the dressing room with

3
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:04,235
- [All] Fifth Harmony!

4
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:05,697
- I am really excited because today

5
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,462
I have a super special video for all of you.

6
00:00:07,462 --> 00:00:09,830
Every video, I ask you guys to comment down below

7
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,164
with who you guys want to see me do magic for.

8
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:13,406
And when I was looking through the comments,

9
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:15,170
the number one name I saw was Fifth Harmony.

10
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,610
If you love Fifth Harmony, let me know

11
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,084
by liking this video.

12
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,334
And let's get to the magic.

13
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:24,250
- [Camila] Any card?

14
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,320
- [Collins] Any card.

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,246
- Boop!

16
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:28,079
- [Collins] The joker.

17
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:28,912
- Yeah.

18
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,091
- [Collins] All right, cool, so take it out.

19
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:30,925
And what I want you to do, actually,

20
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:32,573
if I can get your autograph.

21
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,965
All right, you can just take the card and just sign it.

22
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:35,798
- Okay.

23
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:37,530
Sorry I write like a Third grader.

24
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,819
- [Collins] It's all good.

25
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:39,652
- Heh

26
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:41,141
- [ Collins] Cool, cool, Alright cool.

27
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,429
So basically the reason I have you sign it

28
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:43,834
is because, that way, there is only one card

29
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:46,678
like this with this exact signature in the entire world.

30
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:48,152
It's impossible to duplicate it.

31
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:49,174
So this is going to be your card.

32
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,038
So you can feel it, the ink won't come off?

33
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:52,610
- Nope. Won't come off.

34
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,270
- [Collins] Check it out so we use your joker.

35
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,081
Check this out.

36
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:57,707
I'm going to try to fold it up a little bit.

37
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:59,936
And I want you to actually open up your mouth.

38
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,607
- Okay. Well!

39
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:03,917
- And I want you to bite on the card.

40
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,264
Cool, alright here we go.

41
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:07,888
So here, I'll use my own card here.

42
00:01:07,888 --> 00:01:08,758
Jack of Hearts.

43
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:10,279
So here, I'll sign the Jack.

44
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,862
Get a shot of this.

45
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:17,612
Like that. You saw my signed Jack.

46
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,729
Alright so what's going to happen here,

47
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:20,562
- [Camila] Tastes funny.

48
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:21,412
- [Collins] Tastes funny, right?

49
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:22,245
- Yeah tastes like Sharpie.

50
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:23,571
- Blue cards taste better, actually.

51
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:24,674
Check it out, watch.

52
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:26,856
See my Jack right here? Check this out.

53
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:28,354
Put it down.

54
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,665
Alright, so watch this.

55
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:33,323
(techno music)

56
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:35,156
- [Ally] It's so cool.

57
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:37,632
- What's going on?

58
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,492
- [Camila] Open the card!

59
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:45,629
- Check it out, you signed the Joker

60
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:46,720
and put it in your mouth.

61
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,055
(gasps)

62
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:49,555
- [All] Oh my God!

63
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,903
- [Normani] What the heck?

64
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:56,903
I wanna try!

65
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:58,878
- Mind blown!

66
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:02,264
- Give this video a huge thumbs if you enjoyed

67
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:03,982

87
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:42,954
- Normani, please! I'm kidding!
