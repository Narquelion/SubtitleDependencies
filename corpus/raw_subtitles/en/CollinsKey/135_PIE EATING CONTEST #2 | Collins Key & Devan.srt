1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,968
- What's up? (funky instrumental music)

2
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:01,850
It's Collins Key and welcome

3
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,703
to the second annual pie eating contest.

4
00:00:04,703 --> 00:00:07,080
I started this last year during Thanksgiving time

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,525
and basically, how this contest works is I have

6
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:12,003
to eat a pie in one minute.

7
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:13,802
So last year I ate this kind of pie,

8
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:15,277
which was massive and there was no way

9
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:16,649
that I could eat it in a minute

10
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,628
and so this year, I've got a slightly smaller pie.

11
00:00:18,628 --> 00:00:20,724
(laughing)

12
00:00:20,724 --> 00:00:21,940
- That gun sucks.

13
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,169
(laughing)

14
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:24,282
- You blame it on the gun?

15
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:27,407
So this year I have to eat this pie in the one minute time

16
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:28,356
and for those of you guys who are wondering

17
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:30,901
why Devan's here, besides trying to shoot me with nerfball.

18
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,518
Basically, Devan's only job is to make sure

19
00:00:33,518 --> 00:00:35,672
that I don't eat this pie in one minute.

20
00:00:35,672 --> 00:00:37,449
So he's gonna do everything he possibly can

21
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:39,513
to distract me from eating this.

22
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:40,589
So we're gonna give this a shot

23
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:42,645
and whoever loses this is gonna get smack cammed

24
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:45,198
by the other person with a handful of whipped cream.

25
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:47,271
So make sure you guys watch until the end to see

26
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:49,112
how this whole thing turns out and yeah, let's get into it.

27
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:50,161
Alright, so we have one minute.

28
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,118
Here is the pie.

29
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,686
Devan, (lids clattering)

30
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,358
(laughing) okay, great.

31
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:55,415
(whipped cream spraying)

32
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:57,127
We're gonna get a little bit of whip on there first.

33
00:00:57,127 --> 00:01:00,544
(whipped cream spraying)

34
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,819
(laughing)

35
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:06,803
That was not smooth at all.

36
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:08,976
- Three, two, one.

37
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:10,202
Okay, so you know this round.

38
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:11,254
(laughing)

39
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:12,862
- You didn't say begin!

40
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:14,894
(laughing) - I have to say begin?

41
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:16,263
- Yeah, go.

42
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:17,778
- Alright, begin! (bell ringing)

43
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,405
Okay, so this round I'm not even actually worried

44
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:21,575
because my strategy this year, as opposed to hitting him

45
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:24,759
in the eye a ton, (slapping)

46
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,723
(yelling)

47
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:29,382
I'm actually just gonna add a bunch of volume

48
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:30,509
to his meal, so--

49
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:31,575
- I'm already halfway done, dude!

50
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:32,408
(laughing)

51
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:35,658
- I actually added a ton of grapefruits

52
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,374
and of course, some lifesavers.

53
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:41,358
So enjoy that. - What?

54
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:43,889
- And now, to hit him in the face.

55
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:45,792
(slapping)

56
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:46,818
- Ow. (squeaking)

57
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:49,067
- Try another one, oh!

58
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,512
And the socks attack!

59
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:53,235
(yelling) Oh, snap, get him.

60
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:55,885
(laughing) (yelling)

61
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,384
There's no way you're gonna do it.

62
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,647
(groaning) (plastic clicking)

63
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:03,085
Tape those ears around. (laughing)

64
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:07,018
(video tape fast-forwarding)

65
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:08,284
Oh! (laughing)

66
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:09,117
(video tape fast-forwarding)

67
00:02:09,117 --> 00:02:10,302
(yelling)

68
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:13,035
- Well, the competition is over and the results are in

69
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:15,071
and it looks as though Devan won--

70
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:15,904
(yelling)

71
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:16,737
again. - That's what

72
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:17,570
I'm talking about. - I don't know

73
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,403
how it happened.

74
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:19,236
I don't know how it happened-- - I do.

75
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:20,210
- But-- - I'm just a beast

76
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,165
at doing this, man.

77
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:22,090
I'm really good.

78
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,195
- Okay, ow.

79
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:24,330
(laughing) (groaning)

80
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,291
It's like on my hair, okay.

81
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,247
It's time I guess for Devan to smack cam me,

82
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,156
so if I can just get out of this stuff.

83
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:30,794
(groaning)

84
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:32,081
That actually hurts my hair, hold up.

85
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,304
Oh God, ow.

86
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:34,602
Dude, why'd you put it like all in my hair?

87
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:35,435
Okay, hold up.

88
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:36,268
I've untaped myself--

89
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:37,934
(yelling) (laughing)

90
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:39,279
- I missed.

91
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,310
I just have to do it again.

92
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,507
- What was that, bro?

93
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:43,291
(smacking) (groaning)

94
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,615
(laughing) (smacking)

95
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:46,779
(whipped cream spraying) - No!

96
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,525
(whipped cream spraying) (spitting)

97
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:49,358
- That doesn't work.

98
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:50,191
Not smart. (slapping)

99
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,676
(yelling)

100
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:52,532
(whipped cream spraying)

101
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:53,684
- My ear again!

102
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:54,630
(yelling) (whipped cream spraying)

103
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,360
- No! (slapping)

104
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,649
(laughing) My eye!

105
00:02:58,649 --> 00:03:00,990
(whipped cream spraying) (laughing)

106
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,070
(spitting)

107
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,152
