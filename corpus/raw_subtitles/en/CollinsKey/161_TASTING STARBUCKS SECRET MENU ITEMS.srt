1
00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:01,382
- What's up, it's Collins Key, and

2
00:00:01,382 --> 00:00:02,740
for today's video, I am doing something

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,260
that people have warned me my

4
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,315
entire life, I should never do.

5
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,880
Today, I'm gonna be trying coffee for the very

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,976
first time, but not just any coffee.

7
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:13,529
Today I'm trying secret Starbucks menu items,

8
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:15,178
and to do this, I need my brother to help me out.

9
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:17,447
Who also has never drank coffee his entire life.

10
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:18,585
Devan Key.

11
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,418
(snaps)

12
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:20,877
There we go, what's up bro?

13
00:00:20,877 --> 00:00:23,361
There's no official secret Starbucks menu,

14
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,634
but there are a ton of amazing people online,

15
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,540
who have created their very own

16
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,718
recipes that taste like everything.

17
00:00:28,718 --> 00:00:30,378
From Harry Potter drinks to Girl Scout cookies,

18
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:32,648
just everything in between, and

19
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:34,766
they post these recipes online.

20
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:36,432
Today we're gonna be testing out these items

21
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:37,842
to see whether or not they actually taste good,

22
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:39,346
and since Devan and I have never tried

23
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:41,325
coffee before, give this video a thumbs up

24
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:43,455
if you guys are excited to see what happens to Devan and I,

25
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:44,288
because we might just go off the walls crazy.

26
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,881
Please give us a thumbs up for our first

27
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:47,326
time trying coffee, and make sure you guys go

28
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:48,829
follow Devan on all of his social media.

29
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,141
- My Snapchat link is there.

30
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:51,517
- Mine is there.

31
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:53,716
- All my other links is down below, so let's go.

32
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:56,543
- Okay, we're gonna go like that,

33
00:00:56,543 --> 00:00:57,376
we'll just start the challenge.

34
00:00:57,376 --> 00:00:58,377
- Let's do it.

35
00:00:58,377 --> 00:00:59,538
- We're kicking things off with a bang,

36
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:02,602
and this is Nutella, I have no idea how

37
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:05,928
this is gonna taste, but I'm so excited.

38
00:01:05,928 --> 00:01:06,793
- Let's do it.

39
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:07,919
All right, I'm ready for this.

40
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:10,086
(moaning)

41
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:13,502
- I literally just clapped, and had water on my hands,

42
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:14,895
and the water clapped into my eyeball.

43
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:17,222
I got Nutella in my eyeballs, so I can't see too much.

44
00:01:17,222 --> 00:01:18,888
This reminds me of the 100 layers challenge

45
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:20,479
with Nutella on my face right now.

46
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,831
It's a flashback.

47
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,083
100 layers of hair gel and Nutella!

48
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,017
(screams)

49
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:25,850
- I thought this one was good.

50
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,956
- Yeah this one taste delicious.

51
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:27,902
We're off to an amazing start.

52
00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:28,735
- Yeah.

53
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:29,894
- Oh my God, ouch.

54
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:31,609
This flavor is, Cinnamon Toast Crunch!

55
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:32,442
- Alright.

56
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:33,368
- I have no idea how this is going to taste.

57
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:34,505
So let's give it a shot, this is,

58
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:35,338
how are we gonna do this?

59
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:36,380
This is way too intimate, I cant do this.

60
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,150
- Should we take off the top, and then we like?

61
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,282
- Yeah let's do that.

62
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:40,321
- Hold up, this is gonna be tough.

63
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,406
Yay.

64
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:43,573
(moaning)

65
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:46,015
- This one, like, I didn't think these

66
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,686
would actually taste like it at all,

67
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:49,038
but this one tastes exactly like

68
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:50,315
a Cinnamon Toast Crunch, like this is.

69
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:51,807
- Yes, no, I literally.

70
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:52,640
- Wow!

71
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,314
- I taste the cinnamon, I tasted the toast!

72
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,475
- I tasted the crunch!

73
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:56,735
So the question I have for you Devan.

74
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:57,568
- Yeah?

75
00:01:57,568 --> 00:01:58,592
- On a scale of one to 10, one being

76
00:01:58,592 --> 00:01:59,759
the least accurate, 10 being the most

77
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,691
accurate, how accurate is this flavor?

78
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,314
- About a five, I just tasted a lot of toast.

79
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:08,713
I didn't taste a lot of cinnamon.

80
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:09,816
- Okay, yeah, you're actually right,

81
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:10,860
this does get a five.

82
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,693
- Yeah.

83
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:12,648
Next up, we have Thin Mints.

84
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:13,658
- Like the Girl Scout Cookies?

85
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:14,491
- Yeah.

86
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,324
- What?

87
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:16,177
- And I've never had it in coffee form,

88
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,812
but I have to say, the cookie form, so good.

89
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:21,412
- Okay, well you get the first sip, honorary first sip.

90
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:24,829
- Oh it's not coming out, not coming out!

91
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:29,176
- Is it good?

92
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:30,539
(moans)

93
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,647
- Really good right?

94
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:33,406
- See the thing is, I've never actually

95
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,538
had a thin mint in my life.

96
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:35,530
- Really?

97
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,650
- So I don't know what to compare it to.

98
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,483
- Well I have to say they nailed it, it's really good!

99
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:38,566
- Okay so I'll go with yours,

100
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,392
thin mints a perfect 10 out of 10.

101
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:43,019
- It was like blended up thin mints.

102
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:43,852
It was really good.

103
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,205
- Being a wizard, this one here is

104
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:47,801
super exciting for me, because this

105
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,047
is a Harry Potter butterbeer flavor.

106
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:51,092
So, give it a little mix.

107
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,092
- Go for it!

108
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:55,354
Yeah, let me try it!

109
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:58,289
- This one is delicious!

110
00:02:58,289 --> 00:02:59,369
- Yeah it was really good!

111
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:01,069
- This one is my favorite one by far, so far!

112
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,868
- I don't know if butterbeer is.

113
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:04,180
- What was that?

114
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,556
(babbling)

115
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:06,389
- I don't know if butterbeer is

116
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,622
supposed to taste like something,

117
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,624
but I mean, taste like how I imagine.

118
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:10,994
- This one was delicious, they nailed it!

119
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:13,321
10 out of 10, Dumbledore would be proud!

120
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:14,244
This one has got to be the most

121
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,573
confusing item on the menu, because

122
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:17,325
it's called, Blue Drink, but it looks like this.

123
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:18,554
- It's pink.

124
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:19,767
- It's pink.

125
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,172
- Alright, go for it.

126
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:22,005
How is it?

127
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,042
(groans)

128
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:30,452
Tastes like watered down yogurt, or blueberries.

129
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:32,182
- But like so watered down, that

130
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:34,480
it's like the smallest amount of yogurt possible.

131
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,467
- Yeah.

132
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:36,300
(groans)

133
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,133
Oh that was gross.

134
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,827
- But it's called Blue Drink, why?

135
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:39,855
Negative five for me, negative five.

136
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:41,045
- Negative 20.

137
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:41,878
- Whoa!

138
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:42,711
(laughs)

139
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:43,544
Okay.

140
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:44,594
- Next up we have cotton candy!

141
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:46,056
This is another confusing one, because

142
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:49,463
it's not pink, or any color at all.

143
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,456
- Well I guess it looks like cotton,

144
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:51,681
'cause cotton's white, so just like

145
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,259
cotton and candy, not cotton candy.

146
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:54,814
- It's not what you first think of, you know?

147
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:55,647
Alright.

148
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,468
- I'm not a big fan of this one,

149
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:06,190
I think it got, I'll give it like a three.

150
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,023
- I'd say it was pretty close,

151
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:07,978
I'll give it a five.

152
00:04:07,978 --> 00:04:09,272
- And now we got a banana cream pie.

153
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:11,855
Not too excited about this one.

154
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:18,953
(loud exhale)

155
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,642
- It tasted like artificial bananas,

156
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:21,838
which is probably what it was!

157
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:22,671
- I don't like it!

158
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:23,509
So we've just been informed, that

159
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,094
this is actually the only one with

160
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:26,591
real ingredients, this is the only one

161
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:27,424
that actually has a banana in it.

162
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:28,257
- And it tasted fake!

163
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:29,325
(laughs)

164
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:30,248
I'd say a zero.

165
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:31,081
- Yeah it gets a zero.

166
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:31,914
Zero.

167
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:33,335
- Yeah, tastes as bad as the blue one.

168
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:35,164
- Yeah it honestly gets a zero.

169
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:36,429
Another confusing flavor, we have

170
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:37,346
the raspberry cheesecake, which

171
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,668
as you expect the color is, brown?

172
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:41,165
(laughs)

173
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,233
Like, I don't know, why is it brown?

174
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,510
- Hopefully it tastes like it.

175
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,932
I've never had a raspberry cheesecake,

176
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:46,557
but I'll try to combine the two flavors

177
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:49,923
in my mind and see what happens.

178
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:50,904
- Well.

179
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:53,876
- That did not taste like what you'd expect.

180
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,709
- A raspberry or a cheesecake.

181
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:55,542
Yeah I'm giving it a zero, there

182
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,470
is nothing more to say on that.

183
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,148
Like I've got the after taste in my mouth

184
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,337
right now, waiting for it to develop

185
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:01,131
into the raspberry cheesecake, but no.

186
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:02,431
It just tastes like coffee, so.

187
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:03,264
Boo.

188
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:06,445
Yeet!

189
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:07,548
(laughs)

190
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:10,538
The most all-american secret item, apple pie.

191
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:13,095
- Wow you went right in for that!

192
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:15,091
- Gotta swish it around in your mouth

193
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:16,809
there for a little bit, just gotta.

194
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:19,514
- You know what, that one got better as it went on.

195
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:21,162
At first I didn't like it.

196
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,538
It tastes like apple pie.

197
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,983
- 11 out of ten.

198
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:24,816
- Really?

199
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:25,649
- Oh yeah!

200
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:26,775
- I'd say an eight, tasted kinda artificial.

201
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:28,737
- Well I'm not expecting a real apple pie to be in there.

202
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:29,863
- But bro, I mean.

203
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:30,849
- Like if they put a real apple pie

204
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:32,080
in here I would be concerned.

205
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,223
- I wouldn't, I'd love that!

206
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,173
- This one was definitely a highlight of this video, so far.

207
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:36,607
This one is the most anticipated

208
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:38,133
of the entire video, this is,

209
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,633
the cinnamon roll!

210
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:43,694
- Nope.

211
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:46,404
- Doesn't taste like cinnamon roll at all.

212
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:47,280
- No it doesn't.

213
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,192
Oh, wait!

214
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:49,834
It has the aftertaste of a cinnamon roll.

215
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:51,407
So it doesn't taste like a cinnamon roll,

216
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:52,783
but the aftertaste tastes like what

217
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:55,127
the aftertaste of a cinnamon roll would taste like.

218
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:56,531
- No still nothing, this one gets zero.

219
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:57,364
- Really?

220
00:05:57,364 --> 00:05:58,226
- Yeah.

221
00:05:58,226 --> 00:05:59,298
- I'll give it a seven.

222
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:00,918
- Thumbs up if you love coffee,

223
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:03,280
and thumbs up if you don't love coffee!

224
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,113
- Yeah!

225
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:04,946
- Well I want to get both people

226
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:05,779
to thumbs up the video.

227
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,039
And comment down below what flavor

228
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,258
would you love to see on the secret menu

229
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,091
at Starbucks, it can just be

230
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:11,278
your favorite food turned into a coffee.

231
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:12,317
I love you guys so much and I

232
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:14,226
will see you again very soon, bye!

233
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:15,416
