00:00:02,393 --> 00:00:03,310
That's the name of the game.

4
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,244
Everyone follow the queen, okay?

(electronic dance music)

25
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:28,394
You're watching the wrong card.

00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:44,998
I'm distracting you.

44
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:45,831
You don't wanna watch the four.

45
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:46,664
Always watch the queen.

46
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:47,524
Watch the queen right here.

00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:02,136
Queen in the pocket.

61
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:02,969
Queen goes away.

62
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:03,871
This is the easiest game of all time.

00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:27,331
then the queen's in my hand.

85
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:28,791

Everyone watch this, watch.

00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:46,977
I put the queen in my pocket.
