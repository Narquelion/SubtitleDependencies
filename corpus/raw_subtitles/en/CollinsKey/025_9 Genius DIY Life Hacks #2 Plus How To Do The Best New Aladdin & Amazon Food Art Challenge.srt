1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,023
- [Collins] You challenged us to make

2
00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:03,150
a pizza into a balloon, so, let's go.

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,520
- [Devan] First up, I'm adding some sauce.

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,910
- And, for my sauce I've got some tomatoes here.

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,935
So, bam like that.

6
00:00:06,935 --> 00:00:07,768
Alright, here we go. - Whoa, whoa,

7
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:08,680
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

8
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,513
- [Collins] I'm just gonna

9
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:10,346
whoa, whoa! squeeze up some tomatoes

10
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:11,179
and make some sauce.

11
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,012
So, here we go. - [Devan] You don't need

12
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:12,845
to make genuine sauce.

13
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:13,678
- [Collins] Look at that, all of those good tomato juices

14
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:14,511
just coming right out like that.

15
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:16,010
- [Devan] Next up, I'm laying down a pesto base.

16
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,926
- [Collins] That actually looks super cool.

17
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:17,759
Wait, so what are you doing?

18
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:18,610
- [Devan] I'm making pizza art

19
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,070
and I'm doing Chuck from Angry Birds

20
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,220
Nice, yeah. - [Collins] Oh, my gosh, bro.

21
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,260
It's like pureed.

22
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,610
I gotta say man, home-made sauce

23
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,770
is absolutely the way to go.

24
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,910
The only thing that's missing is a smidge of seasoning.

25
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,962
Here we go, just a smidge of seasoning.

26
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,170
Boom, there we go.

27
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,360
- A smidge, dude?

28
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,440
- That's a full mountain. (coughing)

29
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,700
- [Collins] You know what, to try to compensate

30
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,533
for how much this smells,

31
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:35,930
we're going to add some red sauce to it

32
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,190
to get the more authentic sauce.

33
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,100
Perfect, just like that.

34
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,540
Uhhh! It's like grass.

35
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,520
This looks more like horse food than any thing else man.

36
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,790
- Dude, mine is not turning out,

37
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,470
but I promise it's gonna look good.

38
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,303
- Oof!

39
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:46,136
- [Devan] Looks like a banana.

40
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:46,969
- I've got to say Devan, for some reason

41
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:47,860
I feel like a beetle right now

42
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,060
and I feel that this mound right here

43
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,170
is my magnum opus, my one rig creation,

44
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,570
and, all I want to do is, I just wanna roll it.

45
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,830
I wanna roll it down a hill. - Uh huh.

46
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,240
- (incoherent) is way too wet right now

47
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,700
it would just splash everywhere,

48
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,240
so, I've got some flour over here.

49
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,140
And just a handful.

50
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,850
Remember my hand is exactly one cup of flour.

51
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,680
So, here we go, just gonna add some flour on just like this.

52
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,513
Oh, man.

53
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:05,610
- [Devan] Wait, Collins, what are you making?

54
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,443
- [Collins] I'm trying to make the

55
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:08,500
best tasting balloon pizza of all time.

56
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,650
- That's going to be the best tasting pizza of all time?

57
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,860
- If this doesn't look like deliciousness to you, Devan.

58
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,420
Five star quality right here.

59
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,360
Michelin stars up the wazoo, bro.

60
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,880
- [Devan] Next up for me, is making the feathers.

61
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,360
I've got my pizzas cut and now it's time

62
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,460
to assemble them on chuck.

63
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,430
- This is what we call ma sauce.

64
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,530
Just gotta add all this in, you know,

65
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,567
just gotta ma sauce in,

66
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:25,400
,so, here we go. - [Devan] Yup.

67
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,810
- It's so cool cause you would never find this

68
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,460
on a Papa John's or Pizza Hut menu, bro,

69
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,412
because this is a Keysa, a Key bros Pizza.

70
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:31,870
Do you know what my pizza is missing right now, Devan?

71
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,840
- Um, restraint?

72
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,530
- No, it's missing pineapple!

73
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,040
I love pineapple on my pizza bro!

74
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,020
It's the best thing ever!

75
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,140
And now it's time to turn these into actual pizza balloons,

76
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,740
so, we've got the top dough crust.

77
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,573
So, here it goes. - [Devan] Yup.

78
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:42,406
We're gonna flip it over like this.

79
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:43,239
Now we just gotta get it to fall off.

80
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,072
So, here we go. - Uh-huh.

81
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:44,905
We just gonna have to try to maybe spin it a little bit

82
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:45,800
on my knuckles.

83
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,120
Here we go, it's gonna spin like that.

84
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,147
Okay, oh boy.

85
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:49,100
So here we go, just gonna stretch it out,

86
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,210
get it all doughy, but you know what,

87
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,590
I gotta get a little bit of flour on my hands.

88
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,423
So, here we go.

89
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:53,256
Just got a little bit of flour over here.

90
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:54,830
I get to do a high five as I transfer.

91
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,305
Ah man. Sorry.

92
00:01:57,305 --> 00:01:58,138
- What!

93
00:01:58,138 --> 00:01:59,003
That is yours now. - Hey, hey, hey

94
00:01:59,003 --> 00:01:59,836
That is No no no no no no no no no no

95
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:00,669
yours now. Devan, Devan, I need you to

96
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:01,502
Yes, thank you. No, no,

97
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:02,425
Keep wiping it off. no, nope, no, no.

98
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:03,258
Alright, here we go.

99
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:04,091
I put the dough back on this thing here.

100
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:04,924
So, here we go.

101
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:05,757
We're just gonna flip it up like this

102
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:08,640
and just let it kinda fall and drip perfectly onto my pizza.

103
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,840
See, it's coming right off right now.

104
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,673
Here we go.

105
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:11,740
Just gotta perfectly lay it down.

106
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,840
This is not working bro.

107
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,870
I cannot figure out how to do this.

108
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,180
- [Devan] I'm pinching it together right now

109
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,150
so that when we inflate it,

110
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,110
it won't leak any air.

111
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,540
- And I'm not doing anything good.

112
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,730
Before we inflate the pizza balloons,

113
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,297
as you can see, there's a mount on Devan's.

114
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:24,680
And that is a light bulb, a heat lamp in fact,

115
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,450
that will be cooking our pizzas from the inside out.

116
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,790
- It's time to blow up the pizza balloons

117
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,240
and I'm gonna be using this straw.

118
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,390
- Dude, that's gonna take forever, bro.

119
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,290
I've got a high pressure air pump right now,

120
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,123
check this out. - Wait, what?

121
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:35,438
Yup! Three, two, one.

122
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,149
Aaah! - Aaah!

123
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:38,434
(Collins screaming) Oh no!

124
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:39,267
Whoa!

125
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:42,017
(operatic music)

126
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:52,920
- You know what, I think I'll stick to the straw technique.

127
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,470
And right now, it's time to inflate these.

128
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,953
Dude these pizza balloons look like a dragon egg,

129
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:57,570
so here is a big reveal.

130
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,780
Ready, set, go! Tada! - Ready, set, go! Tada!

131
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,799
That looks so crazy man. Dude!

132
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,557
It looks like a dragon might actually pop out of this.

133
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:05,049
So, you get to comment down below,

134
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,230
who's do you think will look cooler?

135
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,280
Cause we'll be cutting them open

136
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,860
and eating them at the end of the video.

137
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,960
You challenged us to try egg art, so, let's go.

138
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,480
First up, we gotta crack a whole bunch of eggs

139
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,030
and separate the yolks from the egg whites.

140
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,900
Now that we've got the egg whites and the yolks separated,

141
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,230
it's time to add the food coloring.

142
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,540
- [Devan] I'm making Jafar from Aladdin.

143
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,430
- [Collins] And I'm making Sweet Pea

144
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,730
from the Secret Life of Pets 2.

145
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,980
Wait, is yours this runny?

146
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,770
- [Devan] Yeah, it's way runnier than pancake

147
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,603
batter. - [Collins] No, look at!

148
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:25,436
Mine's like a soup.

149
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:26,780
Do you have egg yolks or egg whites?

150
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,613
- Egg yolks.

151
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:28,937
- Oh, that's why. What?

152
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:29,770
Well, you know what, You have egg whites?

153
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,603
I didn't know, okay?

154
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:32,330
I just, I thought, any part of the egg will do.

155
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,260
This will just be a red boarder, a red outline.

156
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,750
Beautiful sunset sky, that's what I'm doing over here.

157
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,960
- [Devan] Instead of giving him a black hat,

158
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,030
I'm gonna give him a blue hat.

159
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,190
- [Collins] See you taking some creative liberties

160
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,250
when it comes to your guy. - [Devan] Yep.

161
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,180
Let's get a little bit of black down for an eye ball,

162
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,050
so here we go. - [Devan] Oh no!

163
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,660
It's running over the lines.

164
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,493
- Devan. Pancake batter

165
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,326
doesn't do this.

166
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:48,450
You're gonna be in big trouble, bro.

167
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,870
This is a completely different medium here.

168
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,703
So, hopefully - Did you just

169
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:51,536
use the word medium.

170
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:52,369
- I did, Devan.

171
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,202
- I'm proud of you, Collins.

172
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:54,280
- It's a completely different large than normal.

173
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,113
Is that right? - No.

174
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:55,946
That one wasn't right?

175
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:56,960
- [Collins] Alright, my dude's got some green eyes.

176
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,700
So, here we go, we'll give him some green eyes right here.

177
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,460
He's gonna have two connected eye balls.

178
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,480
- Oh, he has a little nose.

179
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,860
- [Collins] No, that's his eye, Devan.

180
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,693
He's, that's not - [Devan] What?

181
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:04,526
even his nose. That is?

182
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,340
Oh, man! I did the wrong color in the wrong spot.

183
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,420
He's gonna have one red strand on one side.

184
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,370
- That's not right, Devan.

185
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,490
You probably going lose this.

186
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,360
Look at mine, (tsk) looking pretty good.

187
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,880
No, dude, what is going on?

188
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,868
Did you see this, bro?

189
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,034
Wait, this man - [Devan] Flaking out,

190
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:16,867
What is going on? flaking up.

191
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,400
Why is it coming apart right now?

192
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,233
Brother's gonna - Dude!

193
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,066
ruin my entire art.

194
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,560
- The eyes are so difficult on this thing.

195
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,230
- Well, I guess we gotta continue to fill it in over here,

196
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,213
try to maybe thicken it up a

197
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:25,046
little bit. - [Devan] Yeah.

198
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:26,790
This may look like the pancake art challenge,

199
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,570
but I promise you, it is very, very different.

200
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,530
- [Collins] Gonna try to get my guy some little teeth.

201
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,810
I really shoulda gone for the yolks, man.

202
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,180
This egg white was a terrible idea.

203
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,820
You know what, I'm stopping with the green for a second.

204
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,030
We gotta turn this up, we gotta roast,

205
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,210
we gotta let them solidify a little bit.

206
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,043
Sorry, I didn't mean to bump you.

207
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:38,876
- [Devan] One of the cool things though,

208
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:40,830
is that you can use the egg whites for anything white.

209
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,900
- I've got it.

210
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,170
Gonna add in a whole bunch of yellow

211
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,650
to fill in the rest of it here, like this.

212
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,560
- [Devan] I'm also noticing that

213
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,320
this stuff runs out much faster.

214
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,153
- [Collins] And so, there we go.

215
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:48,986
Boom, yellow is in.

216
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:50,116
Yoosh, look at this thing,

217
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:51,349
but I don't know what's going on

218
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:52,640
with the - [Devan] Oh, man!

219
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,300
I'm gonna try to add a extra layer to the top.

220
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,807
- Oh, my gosh, look at this.

221
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:57,480
There is just all this weird looking foam

222
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,560
on the inside of this.

223
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,020
Oh, what is that?

224
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,330
This is legitimate foam right here.

225
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,690
I have no idea what's happening.

226
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,050
It may not look that cool on this side,

227
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,020
but I guarantee when we flip it, it's going to look amazing.

228
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,853
- [Devan] Mine's all filled in,

229
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:08,850
now it's time to let it cook.

230
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,000
- Alright, well mine is fully cooked

231
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,007
and it smells disgusting in this room right now.

232
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,700
I'm gonna kinda go under like this.

233
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,740
It's kinda - [Devan] It's like rubber.

234
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,573
I'm gonna need an extra one.

235
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:16,406
Can you grab some

236
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:17,239
spatulas? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,072
Cause this is gonna be a full I got you fam.

238
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:18,905
team effort. I got you. I got you.

239
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:19,738
- [Collins] No, no! You split it, you split it,

240
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:20,571
you broke off the top of it.

241
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,404
Okay, on the count of three,

242
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,560
we're just gonna kinda go up and flip over.

243
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,617
- Which way flip over?

244
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:24,530
- Uh, that way.

245
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,930
- [Both] Three, two, one. Oh!

246
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,763
- Oh, oh, ah! - What is it?

247
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:30,690
It's hot. It's an egg.

248
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,320
To be honest, I can't even tell which side is which,

249
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,893
so, hopefully, yours turned out better than mine did.

250
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:34,820
Oh, my gosh,

251
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,880
it comes up so easy. - [Devan] Oh!

252
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,920
It's so rubbery. It's crazy!

253
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,980
Ready, set, go.

254
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,840
Oh, my gosh, yes! - [Collins] Oh! You did it.

255
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,360
Even the colors are so vibrant

256
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,497
even though it's just made outta eggs.

257
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:46,630
So, you get to comment down below who won this round

258
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,360
and we'll be eating them at the end of the video.

259
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,829
You challenged us to make a watermelon pump, so, let's go.

260
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:52,340
- [Devan] First thing, I'm gonna gut my watermelon.

261
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,850
It's time to use my immersion blender.

262
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,429
- Alright bro, well we're gonna go with tandem.

263
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:56,624
Let's clink blenders.

264
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:57,457
(clink)

265
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,419
On three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

266
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:01,300
Awe man, see how it just goes right through, bro?

267
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,550
It is like legit amazing.

268
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,383
Oh, my gosh.

269
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:05,960
Epugch! My eye!

270
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,140
Oh, sorry. Did it get in your eye?

271
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,100
Bro, this has gotta be one of the

272
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,810
greatest inventions of all time, bro.

273
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,670
It's just spraying out.

274
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,030
- It like sucks it down.

275
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,265
- I don't know where mine's coming out of it,

276
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:14,098
but like, it must be like

277
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:15,422
leaking out of the top or something.

278
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:16,788
- It's coming out the front.

279
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:17,621
(cackling)

280
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:18,454
- Oh, my gosh!

281
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:19,640
Oh no! Oh, my gosh!

282
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,733
We gotta close it up, bro. Oh no!

283
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:21,771
It's like going everywhere bro.

284
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:22,638
Here we go. - What are you doing?

285
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:23,471
I don't know,

286
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:24,304
but we gotta close it bro. - [Devan] What are you doing?

287
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:25,137
It's all over my pants.

288
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:25,970
Hold it in place bro,

289
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,803
this is an emergency, Devon.

290
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,636
Duct tape actually did it's

291
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:28,469
job, so uh... - Yeah, that actually

292
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:29,302
worked out.

293
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:30,135
Back in we go.

294
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:30,968
- [Devan] Wait, you're going again?

295
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:31,801
- Absolutely, man! - Aren't you gonna poke

296
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:32,885
another hole? - Nah, probably not.

297
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:33,718
You know what?

298
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:34,590
I wanna get some extra flavors into

299
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,870
my watermelon juice, so here we go.

300
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,841
We're gonna add in some

301
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:37,980
some blueberries into it. - That's a good idea.

302
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,880
We gotta get some raspberries in here like this.

303
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,370
Now we're gonna mash them down, so here we go.

304
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,203
This is gonna go like this.

305
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:43,036
- [Devan] Mine's all

306
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:43,869
blended up (Collins yelling)

307
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:44,702
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

308
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:45,610
You ready for the pour?

309
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,779
Three, two, one.

310
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,029
(Devan yelling)

311
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:49,253
- [Collins] You are splashing it, bro.

312
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:50,220
- I got a clog.

313
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,053
- You know what it needs, bro?

314
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:51,886
Some sweetness. (laughing)

315
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:53,010
So, I'm gonna add some honey comb right here.

316
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,980
Oh, my gosh, bro.

317
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,427
It blends up the honey. Oh, my gosh.

318
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,200
Put it down into the water melon.

319
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,430
Oh, snap. (squealing)

320
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,867
Three, two, one. Oh, man.

321
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,070
It's a little bit more, oh boy.

322
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,340
I gotta say man this has gotta be the

323
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,920
greatest smoothie of all time.

324
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,490
Next up, we got the pump on top.

325
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,323
Alright, here we go.

326
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:10,156
We're gonna take the duct tape like this

327
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:11,540
and then we're gonna start over here like that.

328
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,110
There we go. This is working out great here.

329
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,830
Here we go, just going to pull it over here.

330
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,610
- [Devan] Alright, I think I'm gonna use some glue actually.

331
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,647
And remember, don't try this at home.

332
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:18,590
- We got the completed

333
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,060
watermelon pumps. - And lets see if they work.

334
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,040
Three, two, Three, two,

335
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,950
We have a three second. Oh, wait.

336
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,783
like challenge.

337
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:24,660
We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds.

338
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,660
You ready, here we go.

339
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,540
Three, two, one, done.

340
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,373
- And let us see if they work.

341
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:30,206
- No, no, no, no.

342
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:31,570
We'll be trying that at the very end of the video.

343
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,040
- [Devan] You challenged us to make cement art, so let's go.

344
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,933
- [Collins] I got a cup of cement powder here.

345
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,389
Just gonna add this in.

346
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,430
Oh man. Alright, there we go. - [Devan] Nice, nicely done.

347
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,730
Whoa, dude look at this, it's like bubbling.

348
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,183
Look at that. - Whoa, that's crazy.

349
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:42,850
I gotta say, I've never worked with cement before

350
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,080
and I had no clue you could actually make cement art.

351
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,250
- This is a process you wanna be very careful with.

352
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,640
You do not want this stuff going everywhere.

353
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,010
So, do not try this at home.

354
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:51,960
- Oh, my gosh, I can feel this

355
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,793
starting to come together, bro.

356
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:53,626
What if it just turns into

357
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:54,459
the cement inside - Whoa.

358
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:55,292
the bottom of this, bro?

359
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,125
Like, I gotta go quick.

360
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:56,958
- I hope not.

361
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:57,791
- You may be wondering what type

362
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,920
of art I'm actually going to be making.

363
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,200
I'm making a bowl outta cement hands for my cereal.

364
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,510
First up, ya gotta blow up a glove.

365
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,543
- Wait, you're just making a hand? Whoa.

366
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,950
Mine's not looking that green,

367
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,783
I gotta add more food coloring.

368
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:08,940
- [Collins] Alright, so next step, here we go,

369
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,970
gonna place a glove on the inside just like this.

370
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,020
And you gotta wrap the edges

371
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,630
around the outside of this vase.

372
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,070
- [Devan] Whoa, what, what are you doing?

373
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,820
- I'm just checking to make sure it works.

374
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,653
I think it's gonna work.

375
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:19,700
- That didn't look like it worked at all.

376
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,533
- [Collins] Wait, so what

377
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,366
are you making for your art though?

378
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:22,460
- I'm making a dragon face.

379
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,673
Maybe (sucking)

380
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:24,990
(breathing out) (laughing)

381
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,950
I'm going for a papier-mâché technique.

382
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm gonna dip these pieces into my cement

383
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,480
and then onto the face mask.

384
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,630
- Well, as you're goofing with that, Devan,

385
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,463
I gotta ask you, - Goofing?

386
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:34,610
What does this look like to you, man?

387
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,500
What does this look like?

388
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,333
- Cement.

389
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,190
- What kinda drink does it look like?

390
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,470
- [Devan] It looks like a cement filled drink.

391
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,857
- No, it looks like a protein shake.

392
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:42,890
- I don't know what kinda protein shakes

393
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,723
you're drinking, dude,

394
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,820
but that does not look like mine.

395
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,730
- I gotta say, man, I've never actually shooken up cement.

396
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,563
Is that the word? Shooken?

397
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:48,396
- I don't know, dude.

398
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:49,460
- [Collins] Now, time to fill up the gloves.

399
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,140
So, here we go, just gonna tip it over like this.

400
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,840
- Yeah, whoa, why are ya doing that

401
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,673
so close to me, man? - Alright, here we go, and

402
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:54,980
then, get all the way over.

403
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,150
All the way over like this.

404
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,453
Whoa. Whoa.

405
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,506
Alright, here we go, just gonna peel it.

406
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:00,070
(yelling)

407
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,180
Oh boy, it got everywhere.

408
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,770
I gotta say, brother, this is a pretty funky looking man.

409
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,896
Look at it, it's bouncing up and down.

410
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:06,031
Looks more like a jellyfish than an actual glove and a hand.

411
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:06,864
Alright, here we go.

412
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:08,700
So, right now, time to tie off the top of it.

413
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,533
- Little tough there?

414
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,740
- Next step, time to turn the cement hands

415
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,110
into a little bowl, so here we go.

416
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,810
Gonna add in my glove with a natural plop.

417
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,740
Here we go, three, two, one. - Wait.

418
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,573
Natural plop.

419
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:16,890
- What's an unnatural plop?

420
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,740
- This. (plop)

421
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,980
- Wait a sec - That's an unnatural plop.

422
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,340
More like paranormal activity.

423
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,380
- Well, paranormal plops is

424
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,387
kinda what I was going for there.

425
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:23,220
I wonder if you could go to a

426
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,590
Home Depot and Lowe's and actually find

427
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,780
these little cement hands, bro.

428
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,960
Psych, you could never because they're original.

429
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,793
- All right, just putting the

430
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:30,560
finishing touches on my mask and this thing

431
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,780
is gonna look awesome. (clinking)

432
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,613
- Oh boy.

433
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,180
- This actually turned out just like a dragon.

434
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,060
- And here's the big reveal.

435
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,893
Three, two, Three, two,

436
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:36,726
Oh, yeah. OH, wait.

00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:37,630

And you get to comment down below,

449
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,470
who's cement art turned out better

450
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,450
and we'll be hydro dipping them at the end of the video.

451
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,900
You challenged us to make a whole bunch

452
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,420
of different flavored kabobs with a

453
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,610
homemade kabobing machine, so, let's go.

454
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,443
- [Devan] To make the kabob,

455
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:06,680
you're gonna cut a plastic bottle in half,

456
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,500
take a PVC elbow, drill a hole in it,

457
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,970
and then glue that on the top of the bottle,

458
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,160
take a can, sanitize everything, and you're ready to go.

459
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,300
- [Collins] We've got a whole bunch of food mixtures

460
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,870
and now it's time for Devan and I to battle it out

461
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,570
to see who can make more kabobs.

462
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,070
So, I'm kicking it off with shrimp right now.

463
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,370
- [Devan] And I'm doing mac and cheese.

464
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,680
- A big old handful of shrimp.

465
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,673
Yo, this stuff is congealed. - Yeah.

466
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:23,007
Just kinda like pop it in here like this?

467
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:24,327
- [Devan] No, you don't pop it in, Collins, you pack it in.

468
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:25,850
- And then I'm gonna take a skewer here,

469
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,683
we're have to gonna go through it.

470
00:10:26,683 --> 00:10:27,516
We're gonna push - Yep.

471
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:28,390
down on the count of three.

472
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,223
You ready?

473
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:30,173
Ready, set, go. - Set, go.

474
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:31,006
We're just gonna push

475
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:31,839
down first. Alright,

476
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,750
Let's see, is it gonna go? you gotta push it down.

477
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,583
Oh, my gosh, bro! I think it's going.

478
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,640
Look at it, look at it! It's right there!

479
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,473
Oh! - This?

480
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:36,306
Skewer goes through. (Collins yelling)

481
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:37,245
- [Devan] And then just keep going,

482
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,152
keep going, keep going. - [Collins] Yes! Yes!

483
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:39,985
Look at that. (guttural noise)

484
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:40,883
- There we go man.

485
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:41,758
- Yours actually totally worked

486
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:42,591
Alright, so, yes.

487
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:43,620
the first one, a success.

488
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,300
- As you start you next one, I'm gonna try again.

489
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,330
This thing has to work,

490
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,163
man. - And you know what, man,

491
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,400
I'm going for pasta because I wanna show you

492
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,240
that I can make the noodles

493
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,073
work, bro. - [Devan] Oh!

494
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:50,906
You might be failing, Yes!

495
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:51,760
but I'm winning.

496
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,900
Oh snap. - Yes! Yes!

497
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,733
- It's kabobing, bro!

498
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:54,566
- No it's not.

499
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:55,399
In Wait, wait,

500
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,232
In what world come on, why,

501
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:57,065
is that kabobing? this doesn't...

502
00:10:57,065 --> 00:10:57,898
Now, I'm gonna start with sushi next.

503
00:10:57,898 --> 00:10:59,410
- It may have only kabobed a little piece of noodle,

504
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,780
but that's all I need, so, here we go,

505
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,100
gonna place this down. - Wait a second.

506
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,080
We'll be eating this one here.

507
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,141
This one's gonna be delicious.

508
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,670
- [Devan] Cause that, that didn't actually work.

509
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,960
- [Collins] And I got a two-prong kabober

510
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,300
cause next I'm gonna do my chips and

511
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,133
guacamole. - [Devan] Whoa.

512
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:09,966
Let's see your, oh, boy.

513
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,109
It's not quite kabobing that well.

514
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:12,740
Alright, that didn't kabob - Whoa!

515
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,869
at all. Yes!

516
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,820
(groaning)

517
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,220
Alright, this one turned out a little funky,

518
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,053
but we're on to the next one.

519
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,580
- It's a half kabob. It's a hah-fuv.

520
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,413
For my final one here,

521
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:23,260
I'm gonna plus size some sweet potatoes here.

522
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,093
So, here we go.

523
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:25,370
- [Devan] Oh nachos, don't fail me.

524
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,203
- [Collins] Alright, here we go.

525
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:27,500
Sweet potato's gonna go in like this.

526
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,640
- [Devan] I don't have a good feeling about this one.

527
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,203
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

528
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:33,010
Just gotta get it started first.

529
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,934
Oh, my gosh bro.

530
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:34,980
Oh, man. - Oh! What?

531
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,845
Coming out all sides.

532
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:36,840
(Devan laughing)

533
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,060
What is going on? - [Devan] Whoa.

534
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,997
Gotta lay these down and then try to

535
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:40,530
kabob 'em right here in my hand.

536
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,363
Oh. - Man.

537
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:42,511
I'm splitting one open, here we go.

538
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:43,388
Alright, there we go. (Devan groaning)

539
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:44,221
Just gonna kabob a little bit over

540
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:46,500
here. Oh, my gosh. - Man. (sigh)

541
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,870
It's just so difficult.

542
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,152
I don't think this one works, man.

543
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:50,360
- We've got the kabobs, time to cook them

544
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,340
and we'll be seeing how they taste at the end of the video.

545
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,810
You challenged us to make moon sand.

546
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,643
- [Devan] I'm kicking it off with

547
00:11:54,643 --> 00:11:55,987
my regular sand and adding food coloring.

548
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:57,270
- [Collins] And I'm kicking it off with some soap.

549
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,090
So here we go, just gonna add some soap in like this.

550
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,380
Oh, it looks like the ocean is

551
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,120
coming all onto the beach right now, man.

552
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,038
There we go, that should be - Whoa!

553
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:04,340
enough soap. So, there we go. That looks awesome.

554
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,730
Just a dash of soap.

555
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,563
- [Collins] Oh, man.

556
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:08,020
I gotta say, it's definitely turning a little clumpy,

557
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,990
but hey, it's kinda like turning into

558
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,930
moon sand already, man, with just two ingredients.

559
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,763
What are you doing? - It smells good.

560
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:12,890
Time to spray it with some water.

561
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,820
- [Collins] Wait, we have water spray?

562
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,653
Well, that's cool. - Yes.

563
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:15,486
Here, want some? What? No, no, no.

564
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:16,319
Nope, nope, nope. - You sure? You sure?

565
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,152
Nope, nope. You sure?

566
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:17,985
I'm totally good. Oh, gosh. Oh.

567
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:18,818
It's just a dash of mist.

568
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:19,710
- I'm not feeling misty

569
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,543
today. - I'm sorry.

570
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:21,376
Alright, here we go.

571
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:22,650
You wanna a little mist too? Just a little mist there?

572
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,483
Alright, there you go. - Nice.

573
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,900
Alright, time to add a dash of, what is this? Corn starch.

574
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,070
- [Collins] And I don't think I have enough sand,

575
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,903
cause this is not coming together, man.

576
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:29,960
I think I've thouroughly botched this, bro.

577
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,188
This is not turning out at all.

578
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:34,070
- Oh! Mine's totally working,

579
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,216
dude! - [Collins] Oh, my gosh.

580
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:36,049
Yes!

581
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:36,882
We got a whole bunch of moon sands

582
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,550
and now it's time to make some moon sand art.

583
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,180
We've got some molds here, we're gonna be filling these in.

584
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,260
I'm starting out mine out with Spiderman

585
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,316
from Avengers End Game, so here we go.

586
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:43,600
So we're gonna take some here. - And I'm starting out

587
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,640
with a multicolored fish.

588
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,260
- Okay. Eye number one.

589
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,010
- [Devan] You wanna kinda layer the colors in just like this

590
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,139
and when you pull off the mold,

591
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,510
it's gonna look awesome. - Oh, my gosh. Yo,

592
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,390
that looks super crazy.

593
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,910
Here we go, just gonna pack it in like this.

594
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,103
Alright, perfect, here we go.

595
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:57,120
I think it's gonna look way better than your coy fish.

596
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,390
And next up, we've got a car here,

597
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,313
so I'm gonna make a hot pink car, man.

598
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,810
This thing coming down the road,

599
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,643
you'll know exactly what it is.

600
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:04,102
Gonna use some green for the, for the hood of the car.

601
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:04,935
I think I'm gonna actually gonna try to

602
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:06,690
sell this thing on Autotrader later today, man.

603
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,523
Just try to sell it as like a,

604
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,014
I don't know, a cadillac or an Audi or something.

605
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:09,847
So, - [Devan] Do you think

606
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:10,680
you'll be able to get it insured?

607
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,500
- Bro, I'm sure Geico will insure this car for sure.

608
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,150
It's green. It's just like the little Gecko dude.

609
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,983
So, I, think that - [Devan] Oh yeah.

610
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:16,630
they will like this car a lot, I can guarantee it.

611
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,590
Gonna add, now, some of the pink in here. Oh man.

612
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,940
- Oh, I just got a quick preview.

613
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,773
I think this is gonna look

614
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:21,880
awesome. - That looks really cool, man.

615
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,530
Dude, you are really taking forever, bro.

616
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,554
- [Devan] As I normally do.

617
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,439
(booing)

618
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:26,790
- So, the moon sand is in the mold

619
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,050
and right now, time to reveal, so, here we go

620
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,883
dude, - I'm ready.

621
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:29,760
We gotta flip it super quick.

622
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,620
You ready? Three, two, one. - [Devan] Yep.

623
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,453
Flip. - Done.

624
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:32,286
- Oh, my gosh.

625
00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:33,170
Your end's probably gonna look really good

626
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,803
and mine is questionable at best, we'll see how this goes.

627
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:36,680
You ready to lift it off. - Yeah.

628
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,190
Ready, set, go. Tada! Ready, set, go. Tada!

629
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,412
Oh, my gosh. What!

630
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:41,946
Yo! No!

631
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,066
That is incredible. Bro, look at the

632
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,760
eyeball. What! - [Devan] No!

633
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,440
You get to comment down below. Who's looks cooler?

634
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,320
And we'll be crushing them and then

635
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,770
revealing the face in the end of the video.

636
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,603
And we're onto the next one.

637
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:52,890
You challenged us to waterproof our clothes, so, let's go.

638
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,040
- [Devan] I'm using this small stick of

639
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,680
beeswax on the shoe to start off.

640
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,880
- And I'm using a large thing of

641
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,010
beeswax here on these pants.

642
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:58,843
So, here we go.

643
00:13:58,843 --> 00:13:59,676
This is gonna kinda go back and forth,

644
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:00,900
gotta get the pockets first cause, of course,

645
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,810
if you have stuff in your pockets,

646
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,830
you do not want it getting wet.

647
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,190
Especially if it's like money or a phone.

648
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,430
Will you please hold up one end of the pants like this?

649
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,263
- Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

650
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,740
Yep, yep, yep, yep. Really is gonna, here we go.

651
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,430
Yep, yep, yep, it's working.

652
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,600
- Why are you pulling me off to the side, man?

653
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,433
Devan, I'm just trying to do this, bro.

654
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:13,592
You can let go now. - What, what,

655
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:14,425
You can let go. bro.

656
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:15,258
Devan. Are you sure? Are you sure?

657
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:16,091
Give me it. Is this a test?

658
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:17,010
Let go of it. Are you testing me?

659
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,843
Thank you very much.

660
00:14:17,843 --> 00:14:19,010
I'm actually gonna try to melt on my wax

661
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,240
with a blow dryer here, so, here we go.

662
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,073
Gonna turn this on.

663
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,050
Hopefully the wax will melt right off of it.

664
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,030
- [Devan] Wow, you're really wafting

665
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,863
the smell towards me, dude.

666
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:25,696
- I'm sorry to hear all this.

667
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:26,529
Gonna waft it your way - Yeah, yeah,

668
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:27,362
a little bit more. well, I'm

669
00:14:27,362 --> 00:14:28,195
I'm all good.

670
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:29,028
I didn't - You wanna get

671
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:29,861
No, no, no, no. the flavor of it?

672
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,760
Oh dude! Oh, yes!

673
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,110
This is working, alright.

674
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,120
Gotta melt up my beeswax.

675
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,130
I've got the perfect way to do it.

676
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,100
Here we go, check this out. Ah.

677
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,410
Alright. - Whoa, alright.

678
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,869
Three, two, one. Yeah.

679
00:14:38,869 --> 00:14:40,040
(whooshing)

680
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,873
Wait (laughing)

681
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:41,706
- Sorry, hold on, wait, wait, wait.

682
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:42,722
We've gotta try this again, here we go, two hands.

683
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:43,555
(roaring)

684
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:45,530
And, oh.

685
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,480
Nothing. - That didn't

686
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,440
do anything, again.

687
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,010
Well, if all els fails, use an iron.

688
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,768
So, here we go, just gonna add an iron on like this.

689
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:52,090
- That really works.

690
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,007
Seeing that, I think it's time to upgrade my wax to this

691
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:55,420
stuff. - Wait, you're gonna

692
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,253
upgrade your wax?

693
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:57,143
You know what?

694
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:58,310
I think that means I have to upgrade my wax again.

695
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,563
Actual honey comb beeswax with honey.

696
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:01,520
I'm just gonna get my fingers in this,

697
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,031
peel it off like this.

698
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:05,070
Oh, my gosh, bro. - [Devan] What!

699
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,686
Three, two, one. Oh, man! Two, one.

700
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:11,370
Oh, my gosh. This is how ya do it, bro.

701
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,450
- I think if you sat down,

702
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,587
you'd bring the chair along with you.

703
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:14,420
(laughing)

704
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,260
- That's actually pretty true, man.

705
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,240
If the honey doesn't work,

706
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,200
I will definitely have to buy some new pants from Amazon

707
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,950
because these will not be comfortable to wear.

708
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,783
- While you continue that,

709
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:22,280
I'm gonna use heat to seal my shoes.

710
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,290
Whoa! This is crazy! - [Collins] Yo!

711
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,670
It's insane how it just goes from the white color

712
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,970
back to the original color of

713
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,310
the shoe like nothing happened.

714
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,290
You get to comment down below,

715
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,590
who's outfit you think is actually going to be waterproof.

716
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,140
And we'll be throwing water and fruit juice

717
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,440
at each other at the end of the video.

718
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,710
We've got all the hacks and now it's time

719
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,550
to test them out and see if they actually work.

720
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,680
We've got the waterproof clothes.

721
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,960
We've also got a whole bunch of cranberry juice right here

722
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,700
and this is definitely gonna stain some clothes

723
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,810
if it is not waterproof.

724
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,240
Who should get dumped on first, Devan? What do you think?

725
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,450
- You know what, I think it should be you.

726
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,283
Alright, here we go.

727
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:50,476
Three, two, one. - Oh, man. (groaning)

728
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:51,309
Wait, wait, wait.

729
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:53,360
If you wanna win a 15 minute video call with Devan and I,

730
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,550
text the word HACK to 81800 right now.

731
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,890
So, pause the video, text the word HACK to 81800,

732
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,160
you'll automatically be entered to win.

733
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,820
And let's see if this actually repels a liquid.

734
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,653
- Alright, here we go.

735
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:03,780
Three, two, one. - Oh, man. (groaning)

736
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,660
It's gonna be waterproof though.

737
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,493
- Oh!

738
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:06,874
It's waterp-, oh! That's cold.

739
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:09,791
(electronic music)

740
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,664
It's cold. It's not - It's not waterproof.

741
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:15,497
Waterproof.

742
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:16,410
Alright, and we got

743
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,288
the bucket here - Yep.

744
00:16:17,288 --> 00:16:18,121
Well, let's see if this Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

745
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:18,954
actually works. whoa, whoa. Let's-

746
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:19,787
What, what, what, what? No, no, no, no, let's take it

747
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:20,620
a little bit slower on mine.

748
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,453
Just seeing how What do you mean?

749
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:22,286
yours turned out.

750
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:23,119
- Alright, so we'll start off with a bottle

751
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:25,081
first, Devan. Three, two, one. - Two, one.

752
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:27,998
(electronic music)

753
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,556
Oh! What! Oh! No way!

754
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:32,389
Wait, I missed Way.

755
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:33,309
a little bit, but holy cow.

756
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,142
What?

757
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:34,975
Alright, stick out a leg, now we gotta

758
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:35,808
test out the - Alright, alright, alright.

759
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:36,641
pants. - Yup.

760
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:37,474
Here we go. Three, two, one. Two, one.

761
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:40,391
(electronic music)

762
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,850
No way! No way!

763
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,690
Dude, it just rolls

764
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,523
right off of it, bro. - Whoa!

765
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:47,450
Now, it's time for the ultimate bucket test.

766
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,360
So, Devan, you ready? - Yeah. I'm ready

767
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,193
and confident in this.

768
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:50,915
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

769
00:16:50,915 --> 00:16:53,660
Oh! Oh, man!

770
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,577
(electronic music)

771
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,450
Yeah, the only thing that's wet is my socks.

772
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,155
- [Collins] The pants are still fully intact.

773
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,640
This stuff is incredible. Yeah.

774
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,963
Yeet. Let's go to the next one.

775
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:07,020
I got the pizza balloons.

776
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,930
They are fully cooked and I can't wait to see what

777
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,763
yours looks like. - Yeah.

778
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,380
But, right now, Devan, let's slice these things open

779
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,670
and do not try this at home.

780
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,512
Alright, here we go.

781
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:14,345
It's gonna cut this thing open.

782
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:15,418
Oh, man! What is going on. - [Devan] Whoa.

783
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:16,251
What is that? Whoa, whoa,

784
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,084
A whole lot of wait a second,

785
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:17,917
what is going on?

786
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:18,750
I don't know man.

787
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,583
Hold on. Wait, why is yours

788
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,416
I don't know, I think smoking so much?

789
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,249
I think it's wrecked.

790
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,519
Oh, my gosh, bro. What! - Oh, whoa.

791
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,384
Okay, now let's try to cut this open from a different place,

792
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:25,217
and here we go. - Alright.

793
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:26,420
And then just give it a little tear back,

794
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,340
I guess like that. - Yeah.

795
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,407
Oh! What! Oh!

796
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,540
I can't wait to see how my art turned out.

797
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,520
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

798
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,710
Tada! Whoa. Oh, my gosh, bro.

799
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,970
I gotta say man, I think the recipe

800
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,353
for my pizza is called squizza.

801
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:39,964
It's the way the mountain has discharged

802
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:40,797
across the cutting board. - Oh.

803
00:17:40,797 --> 00:17:43,040
Time to see how this pineapple on pizza tastes.

804
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,873
Alright. - Oh, man,

805
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:44,706
this looks delicious.

806
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:45,539
You (vomiting noise) - Yep, here we go.

807
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,324
Three, two, one. Two, one.

808
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:49,590
(yelling)

809
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,437
How have I never tried this before?

810
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,840
Oh, my goodness! (yelling)

811
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,340
Dude, this is so good. Pineapple on pizza is amazing.

812
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,503
- Oh man.

813
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,336
(noise of champions)

814
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,220
- The combo is so good, dude.

815
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,053
- I'll be right back.

816
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:01,886
- You okay?

817
00:18:01,886 --> 00:18:02,760
- [Collins] Oh yeah, yeah, I'm all good.

818
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,593
- Oh, dear.

819
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:04,870
Well, you guys get to comment down below,

820
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,890
who's do you think was better?

821
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,165
And now, we're onto the next round.

822
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:08,102
- [Collins] Good lord.

823
00:18:08,102 --> 00:18:09,210
- [Devan] We got the cement art.

824
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,170
And I spent some serious time painting mine.

825
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,250
But now, it's all about the marbling of yours.

826
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,500
- [Collins] Now, for the marbling, it's really cool.

827
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,580
I'm gonna start off with a red,

828
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,642
but we've got a whole bunch of colors.

829
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:18,617
Oh, my gosh. - [Devan] Oh. Yep, love it.

830
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:20,140
All it needs is just one drop.

831
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,900
- [Collins] Drop of red, drop of blue, drop of red.

832
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,410
This is one of the coolest art challenges

833
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,660
we've ever done, right here, man.

834
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,630
Oh, my gosh. It's so satisfying.

835
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,020
- So, I actually think mine needs

836
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,720
to be wider to fit over the glove.

837
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,330
So, I'm gonna pull it out from the middle and

838
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,602
make it into a little star. - What!

839
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:36,380
Dude, this is super cool, man.

840
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,780
Alright, here it is, the moment of truth,

841
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,930
time to do the marbling.

842
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,860
Ready, set, go. - Ready, set, go.

843
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,918
Alright, straight down.

844
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:44,800
Straight down. - Oh, man! Oh snap, dude.

845
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,633
It got on both

846
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:46,466
sides of it. - [Devan] Wait, wait, wait,

847
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:47,299
Most of it got on the front. how did you take it out?

848
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:48,132
How did you take it out?

849
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,213
Three, two, one.

850
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,510
Oh! What! - Oh, my gosh, bro!

851
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,210
These actually turned out so incredible.

852
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,350
You get to comment down below,

853
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,110
who's cement art do you think is cooler?

854
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,700
And, right now, we're onto the next one.

855
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,850
Got the water melon pumps and

856
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,470
now it's time to see if it actually works.

857
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,303
So, here we go, man.

858
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:05,030
Ready, set, go. Set, go.

859
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,130
Oh! Oh!

860
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,416
No way, bro! Yes!

861
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,130
Look at this. This totally works.

862
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,060
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my goodness.

863
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,075
Oh, whoopsie. Oh.

864
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:13,908
I think I broke the seal, oh. Oh.

865
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:15,235
It's gotten very sad. Let me help you out there.

866
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:16,430
Alright, well, let's see how these things taste.

867
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,841
Ready, set, go. - Set, go.

868
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:21,120
Bro. So refreshing.

869
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,953
Comment down below,

870
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,670
what is your favorite food we should turn into a pump?

871
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,503
And we're onto the next one.

872
00:19:24,503 --> 00:19:25,790
We've got the moon sand on

873
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,060
and now it's time to get satisfying.

874
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,960
So, Devon, time to slice these, and then smoosh them.

875
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,183
Whoa. - Gotta get perfect with it.

876
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:32,266
Uh-oh. Oh, my gosh.

877
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,470
Uh-oh. This is so satisfying feeling.

878
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,640
Dude, look at that at the bottom right there, bro.

879
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,780
There's so many different colors.

880
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,560
- [Devan] The slicing is the way to go.

881
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,170
- [Collins] Yo this stuff looks like a rainbow, man.

882
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,630
And you gotta try this at home, cause this is so much fun.

883
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,010
- [Devan] This color combo is so satisfying.

884
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,843
- Yo, I gotta say, man.

885
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,360
This stuff totally reminds me of slime.

886
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,860
Right now, we're onto the next one.

887
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,470
We've got all our kabobs and I've gotta say, man,

888
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,570
these look pretty interesting.

889
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,400
I'm kicking off with this one right here and I gotta say,

890
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,410
this kabob is questionable at best.

891
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,650
Oh, man, that one's gonna taste

892
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,483
interesting. - Oy.

893
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:58,316
Alright, here we go.

894
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:00,780
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

895
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,940
Whoa, no.

896
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,780
- That's actually not bad.

897
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,613
- Oh, man.

898
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:04,711
- [ Devan] I think I did a good job.

899
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:05,544
What was that again?

900
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:06,400
- I dunno, man.

901
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,970
- Alright, next up, I'm doing mac and cheese.

902
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,820
- And next up, I'm doing pasta. So, here we go.

903
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,120
This pasta one's gonna be great

904
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,720
- [Devan] Oh, wow, that looks delicious, Collins.

905
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,673
You've got so much there.

906
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:14,620
- Best kabob yet.

907
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,650
- Three, two, one.

908
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,890
That's the best one so far.

909
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,820
- And last, but not least I got my shrimp stick.

910
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,150
- And I got by sushi.

911
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,068
This was not good.

912
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:22,901
(hooting)

913
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:23,847
Two, one. - Three, two, one.

914
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,180
You know, I normally Whoa.

915
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,013
like sushi, but-

916
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:28,180
- Dude, the shrimp kabob was actually amazing.

917
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,043
Kabobed shrimp, ya won. - Well,

918
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:31,360
the mac and cheese was the winner for me for sure.

919
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,193
- [Collins] Comment down below,

920
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:33,990

921

And we're onto the next one.

923
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,220
which one is going to taste worse.

924
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,850
So, I guess we'll just kinda go for bite on it.

925
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,230
