1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,656
- What's up it's Collins Key

2
00:00:01,656 --> 00:00:03,097
and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:05,450
Now for today's video I need my partner in crime,

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,654
my little brother Devan Key to join me

5
00:00:07,654 --> 00:00:08,985
in this chair right here, so.

6
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:10,342
I don't know how this is going to happen

7
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:12,027
but let's try what I always try

8
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:13,832
and this seems to summon the Devan.

9
00:00:13,832 --> 00:00:16,045
Hey! (laughing)

10
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:17,664
It worked.

11
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,664
- I was like

12
00:00:19,749 --> 00:00:21,445
I was literally just working on art

13
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:23,778
and just like appeared here.

14
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:29,178
You okay dude?

15
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:30,011
You okay?

16
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:32,783
- Yeah I was just crying, sorry.

17
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,498
But yeah, seriously I was just working on art,

18
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:35,331
like in my room.

19
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:36,436
- It's just like so funny

20
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,396
when I snap and you're always right there.

21
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:40,229
(laughing)

22
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:42,462
Like what was Devan doing before this?

23
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:43,495
Compose ourselves.

24
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:44,824
Today we are going to be testing out

25
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:46,168
as seen on TV products.

26
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:48,733
And this was inspired by the video we did a little while ago

27
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,947
where we test out 99 cent store products.

28
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:51,780
You guys enjoyed that.

29
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,512
And I guess you guys suggested that we test out

30
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,677
as seen on TV products.

31
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:56,520
I guess some other YouTubers have done it as well,

32
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,487
so we though hey.

33
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:58,634
- Let's do it.

34
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:00,467
- Might as well do it.

35
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:03,480
So yeah, also I'm doing a big giveaway

36
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,313
on my channel right now,

37
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:05,146

There's a giveaway on Instagram, on Twitter.

50
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:28,164
Without any further ado, let's jump

51
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:29,551
- right into the challenge.

52
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,308
- It's not a challenge actually.

53
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,340
(laughing)

54
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,833
- I'm just so used to doing challenges.

55
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:38,025
- Yeah so jump into the as seen on TV product testing video.

56
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:39,978
The first as seen on TV product we are trying out is

57
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:41,350
jeggings!

58
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,830
So here you go Devan. - No, what?

59
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,740
- Yes. - No, no, no I'm not doing it.

60
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,492
I'm done. I'm done. I'm not doing it.

61
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:47,393
- What? Dude you have to.

62
00:01:47,393 --> 00:01:49,033
I can't wear jeggings alone.

63
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:50,713
Come on bro.

64
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:52,195
I can't do this alone.

65
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,306
- Okay, I'll do it.

66
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:56,167
- Thank you and dude these are with real pockets.

67
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,407
So for this video, I've actually done something

68
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,132
I've never done before and I've actually set up

69
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:02,033
an as seen on TV product testing area.

70
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:03,070
So we're going to go to that now,

71
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,929
look very professional, yeah.

72
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:05,762
- This is not going to be good.

73
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:06,595
- It's going to be great.

74
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:07,428
- No.

75
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:10,143
- We are now in the as seen on TV product studio.

76
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:11,060
We're about to test this stuff.

77
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,452
We got some jeggings and we're going to put these on now.

78
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:15,921
Bam and now we're in our jeggings.

79
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:17,161
- [Devan] These look pretty weird.

80
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,956
- So yeah it's like being in man tights.

81
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:19,802
What up guys?

82
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:21,617
Hey chillin' whoa!

83
00:02:21,617 --> 00:02:22,644
- It's really like flexible I can like

84
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:24,942
(laughing)

85
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:25,775
- You almost hit me in the face.

86
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:26,608
Oh you can kick pretty high.

87
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:28,089
Just be like waboosh.

88
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:29,862
We're going to see if the jeggings improve our ability

89
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:31,605
to jump at all, because I don't know.

90
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:32,438
- What?

91
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:33,271
- I don't know we'll try it.

92
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,604
Three, two, one.

93
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:39,510
Okay, show them your (laughing)

94
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,705
We are not skilled in the way of how to wear jeggings yet,

95
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:43,814
so let's take these off,

96
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,872
and we're going to cut the camera guys.

97
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:47,457
Next up we've got the Pooch Smooch.

98
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:49,770
Which is (laughing)

99
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,603
Do like a choreographed dance like

100
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:57,401
So the Pooch Smooch is eliminate bad breath

101
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:59,275
for dogs of all sizes.

102
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:00,758
And since we don't own any dogs,

103
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:02,311
we're going to be trying these out on

104
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,732
- I thought you were going to say our snake.

105
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:05,444
I was like that's not right.

106
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,007
(laughing)

107
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:07,876
- Oh.

108
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:08,709
- Ah! No!

109
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:10,885
- It looks gross!

110
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:11,718
- No!

111
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:14,825
Ah!

112
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,245
- Let's get it nice and clean guys.

113
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:22,495
(laughing)

114
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,273
- You got it all over my mouth.

115
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:33,789
I'm done!

116
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:37,456
- The Pooch Smooch is not for humans.

117
00:03:37,456 --> 00:03:41,432
Maybe for dogs, but this product is definitely,

118
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:43,874
definitely a fail in our book.

119
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:47,013
Next up I bought us some waist trainers.

120
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:47,846
- Yeah.

121
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,010
- I don't know what these are.

122
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,553
- Wow that is not (laughing)

123
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:56,350
That is not photoshopped at all.

124
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,229
- According to this it'll give us a thinner waistline.

125
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:59,062
- Oh my gosh.

126
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:00,114
- I know these photos are actually

127
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,464
low key kind of terrifying.

128
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:02,867
- Oh my gosh.

129
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,995
- All right here are the waist trainers.

130
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,618
Let's give this a shot.

131
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:06,903
- Mine's already been opened.

132
00:04:06,903 --> 00:04:09,499
- I think it goes on backwards like this here

133
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,913
and then close it up like that.

134
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:12,777
And then what you're going to want to do

135
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:15,944
is you're going to want to pull these.

136
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:19,869
Oh my God, I can't do it.

137
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:22,899
- This can't be good for you.

138
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:23,732
- No.

139
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,330
Well this is the waist trainers.

140
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,384
Show the profile.

141
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:27,716
If you want to squeeze your entire body together,

142
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:30,712
they definitely accomplish that, that's for sure.

143
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,105
For this next

144
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:32,938
- What?

145
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:34,529
- I'm mean introduce you to do it.

146
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:35,939
- No.

147
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:36,772
- Fine do it.

148
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:38,576
- For this next one, I'm doing this

149
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:40,826
and it's called the Vegeta.

150
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,349
(laughing)

151
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:52,032
- That was the last time you are ever introducing something.

152
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,050
(laughing)

153
00:04:58,534 --> 00:04:59,367
Oh my God.

154
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:06,155
Well what it's supposed to do is

155
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:08,191
it's supposed to make perfectly delicious pasta

156
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,024
without the carbs.

157
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:10,351
Great for gluten free diets.

158
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,433
Turn veggies into healthy spaghetti.

159
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:15,373
It doesn't sound very realistic at all.

160
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:16,206
- No.

161
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:19,604
- But let's give it (laughing)

162
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:23,771
let's give this product a shot. (laughing)

163
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:30,045
So for this I brought along an eggplant

164
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:30,903
and this is the one I grabbed.

165
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,743
- And this one's the one that I grabbed.

166
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:34,508
- So yeah, I'll give it a shot.

167
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:35,341
- Whoa!

168
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:36,541
- Okay, okay.

169
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,849
- It actually kind of works.

170
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,965
Although they're really thin noodles.

171
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:44,448
- There is no way that thing is going to fit.

172
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,514
It's way too big.

173
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:47,347
Oh!

174
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,448
Yes!

175
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,275
Never say never guys.

176
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,185
So I would say this is a tentative win.

177
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:55,018
- If you want eggplant noodles

178
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:55,851
and I don't know who does.

179
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,225
- And who wants eggplant noodles?

180
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:59,130
So I guess you really decide for yourself.

181
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,380
(laughing)

182
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:20,499
This next one here is something that I actually

183
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:22,886
would have loved to have in my room as a kid growing up

184
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,492
and that is a Hamper Hoops.

185
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:25,837
So basically it's like a basketball hoop

186
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:27,869
that you throw your dirty laundry into.

187
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:29,355
Pump fake dab.

188
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,199
And um yeah.

189
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,705
Oh we didn't just do that.

190
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:34,328
We're going to look back on that in like six months

191
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,536
and be like what were we doing

192
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:36,376
- One month.

193
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:37,252
If that.

194
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:39,594
- If that so without any further ado

195
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:41,134
let's go give this a try.

196
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:41,967
- Kobe.

197
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:43,573
- Oh!

198
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:44,406
Ow.

199
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:46,969
The edge got my thumb.

200
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:48,384
- You've done played yourself.

201
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:49,445
- All right I've got the Hamper Hoop

202
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:50,808
and Devan's going to shoot first so.

203
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:51,641
- I'm going to shoot some hoops.

204
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:52,685
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

205
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:55,385
- Wo ho, that was so close.

206
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:57,602
He was so close on that one.

207
00:06:57,602 --> 00:06:59,935
(screaming)

208
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:02,201
Oh!

209
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:04,804
All right let's test out the next product.

210
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:06,541
Next up is the one I've been looking forward to

211
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,518
the very most

212
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:09,580
and that is the Wubble.

213
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,413
- The what?

214
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,964
- I don't know it's basically a giant balloon thing.

215
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:14,473
- Wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble.

216
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:15,306
- You say that in every video

217
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:16,414
and I always try to cut it out.

218
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:20,493
It's just so weird. (laughing)

219
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:22,536
I feel like in every video there's one part

220
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:25,036
where you're like wob- cut it.

221
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:30,806
But yeah.

222
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:32,764
I decided to put you on blast right now.

223
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:35,486
You didn't even know that.

224
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:36,521
When I'm like editing a video,

225
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:37,507
oh like there Devan goes

226
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:38,783
with his wobble, wobble, wobble baby.

227
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:41,270
- I only say it in videos.

228
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,290
- You do.

229
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,584
Let's go test it out.

230
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:44,899
- Let's chest it out.

231
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:45,732
- What?

232
00:07:46,663 --> 00:07:47,969
Let's chest it out.

233
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:48,802
First we need to pump.

234
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,785
We need to pump it up.

235
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:53,260
And let's see we have Vaseline first

236
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,125
which needs to be applied using a q-tip.

237
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,386
I think that should be enough Vaseline.

238
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:57,219
All right.

239
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:02,919
- Thrown.

240
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,075
Oh that's awesome.

241
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:07,492
- Almost hit the camera dude.

242
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:12,938
(screaming)

243
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:19,947
- K O.

244
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:21,655
- My God dude that hurt.

245
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:22,783
- Look at what's on his face.

246
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,034
- What?

247
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:24,867
- [Devan] Look at that.

248
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:25,884
- What happened?

249
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,190
Wait what happened.

250
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,023
- [Devan] Oh man.

251
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:29,183
- What happened?

252
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,273
- [Devan] That didn't hurt?

253
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:32,734
- That hurt a lot.

254
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:33,818
- That was awesome though.

255
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:34,651
- Yeah that was fun.

256
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:35,484
- Honestly that was like a ten.

257
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:36,317
- Except for this.

258
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,150
- Yeah that was...

259
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,983
- That was no fun.

260
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:38,816
All right cool next product.

261
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:39,649
- But I would say yeah it was a ten.

262
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:40,494
- Ten, a perfect ten.

263
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:41,744
Two slap hands.

264
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,500
- [Devan] Bro.

265
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,941
Just getting my neck in there.

266
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:48,590
I have one good looking neck.

267
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,743
- All right so that is the (laughing)

268
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:53,732
This is probably one of the weirdest videos

269
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,184
we've ever done.

270
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:57,344
