1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
- What's up? It's Collins Key and welcome to

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,488
the third day of logna.

3
00:00:03,488 --> 00:00:05,529
For today's video, I'm going to be joined by a guest,

4
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:07,799
but right before we started filming there was

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,671
a little bit of an accident.

6
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:10,895
Devan, what just happened bro?

7
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:12,725
- I was told to shake up this pancake batter.

8
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:16,932
Oh, nothing will happen. It'll be fine Devan...Yeah.

9
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:18,985
- [Collins] We literally haven't even started filming yet,

10
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:23,186
and then...yep. It's gonna be a great video for sure.

11
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:24,126
- For sure

12
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:25,970
- And since we don't have an extra pair of clothes,

13
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,137
everyone please welcome to the video...Devan.

14
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:35,611
It looks very artsy, until this section right here.

15
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,811
It works perfectly for this video because

16
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:40,961
today we are doing The Pancake Art Challenge!

17
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:43,441
I'm at a severe disadvantage for this challenge.

18
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:45,580
For those again who don't know, Devin is actually

19
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,530
and extremely talented artist.

20
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,860
He's had his art featured on Victoria's Secret model's page.

21
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,529
Her Instagram page, it's her profile picture right now.

22
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:55,360
He's kinda good at art.

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,511
How this challenge works: we asked you guys to tweet us

24
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:59,930
a whole bunch of different ideas for creative pancakes

25
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,144
that we can make.

26
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,080
We have a whole bunch of pancake batter, different color

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,271
batter, and we're gonna go all out creating some serious

28
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:07,592
pieces of art with pancakes.

29
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:10,521
I'm also gonna give away on my channel right now

30
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:12,236

00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:13,906

So be sure to go check it out.

40
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:32,593
Without any further ado, let's jump right into it.

41
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:36,376
Let's try it together: 3, 2, 1...

42
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:38,333
(overlapping speaking)

43
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:42,871
Fudge, let's try it one more time: 3, 2, 1...

44
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:46,278
- [Together] Let's jump right in to it.

45
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:47,718
- Doh, no!

46
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:48,626
Try it one more time

47
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:49,459
(high five)

48
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:50,292
OW!

49
00:01:51,623 --> 00:01:53,206
- That was perfect.

50
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:59,104
- I think this is Pam.

51
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:01,939
I'm gonna start with this stuff right here.

52
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:03,927
I'm low-key kinda nervous about this.

53
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:06,344
(fast music)

54
00:02:08,873 --> 00:02:11,077
I've got the basis of my poop emoji.

55
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:14,465
How you gonna poot that thing bro?

56
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:17,215
- [Devan] You're making me laugh.

57
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:20,549
- I need a double spatula.

58
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:21,909
- I think we made these two big.

59
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,495
- [Devan] Double spatula time. Noooooooo!

60
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:26,578
(laughs)

61
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,019
- No

62
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,869
(laughs)

63
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:35,613
- You lost an eye, there's an eye right there.

64
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,518
Can I have my spatula please?

65
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,526
I need to flip mine, it's getting super burnt dude.

66
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,359
- Okay, fine.

67
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:41,192
- Thank you

68
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:42,025
- I don't know how I'm gonna get it

69
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:42,858
onto a plate though.

70
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,709
- I'm using master chef skills right here.

71
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,839
- It looks like a snowman, like pumpkin.

72
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,006
- How do you flip, okay...

73
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:54,470
- [Together] Ohhhhhhhhhh!

74
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,691
- Mine looks like a demon poop emoji for sure.

75
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,440
- [Collin] These are the pancakes.

76
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,276
- [Devan] You've got the super mad one, and

77
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:04,551
- [Collin] It's got little demon eyes on there.

78
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,050
(demonic laugh)

79
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,581
- How this challenge works: you guys get to

80
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:10,151
comment down below and let us know

81
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,970
on each round who won.

82
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,070
We have Devan's, we have mine.

83
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,406
Comment down below, let us know who won right now.

84
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:17,649
Let's get on to the next pancake.

85
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:19,490
Other than poop emoji, this was the second

86
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,490
most requested one and that is Olaf.

87
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,787
- [Collins] This guy does squats! Look at those legs!

88
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:36,372
Mine looks like a cross between Olaf and a smurf.

89
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:39,748
- [Devan] Oh no, his arm turned into a squiggle!

90
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:41,899
Okay, his body better not...

91
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:42,732
- [Collins] Can you get it?

92
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:46,719
- [Devan] I think so...oh gosh, the arm...

93
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,719
- [Together] Ahhhhhhhhh!

94
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:52,944
- Bam! Olaf. Mine looks like a smurf Olaf

95
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:54,363
who does a lot of squats.

96
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:56,373
Comment down below who won the Olaf round.

97
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:57,687
On to the next one.

98
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:01,104
- Next pancake we're doing is Left Shark.

99
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,263
- [Collins] It just all came out!

100
00:04:09,263 --> 00:04:11,243
- Ohhhhhhhhh no!

101
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:13,560
- [Collins] I know how to remedy this, I can fix it.

102
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,727
I'm going to give him little feet coming out. Bloop.

103
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,829
This guy skips leg day for sure, he's got little legs.

104
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,829
His legs are looking mad funky, bro.

105
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,771
It's turning out really bad guys.

106
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,475
Mine is a literal embodiment of what

107
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:33,057
left shark actually means.

108
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:34,776
- [Devan] What is that eye?

109
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:37,523
- [Collins] He's got a uni-eye.

110
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:38,835
I've got some red for his mouth.

111
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:41,418
- [Devan] No, I need a spatula.

112
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:44,853
- Ooo, that looks scary.

113
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,639
- Look, he's super terrifies.

114
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,299
- [Devan] Really difficult to...hey

115
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:52,930
- [Collins] That actually looks pretty spot-on.

116
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,376
These legs are not staying on his body...oh no,

117
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:58,300
losing a leg. Left shark, pull it together!

118
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,550
90% oil...

119
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,753
- [Devan] That leg is so close to being gone!

120
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:07,083
- [Together] Nooooooooo!

121
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,083
- I lost it!

122
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,794
Take it quick, let's see if I can repair it.

123
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:12,033
- It looks like he fell from something.

124
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:16,200
- [Collins] He fell from my spatula. Left shark is done.

125
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,366
There we go.

126
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:25,623
There we go, perfect.

127
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:28,264
Leg #1 over there, and then quad #2.

128
00:05:28,264 --> 00:05:30,694
One leg is significantly bigger than the other.

129
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:34,543
Left shark: comment down below who won.

130
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,923
Devan or....Devan. Devan won.

131
00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:38,793
I'm calling this one: Devan won.

132
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:40,758
- We have left shark and that guy.

133
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:41,992
- I did get the two eyes...

134
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:45,559
but look how detached the quads are

135
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:48,483
Then again, you guys get to vote. Left shark is all about

136
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:51,547
being on the wrong side of what's going on who knows?

137
00:05:51,547 --> 00:05:54,379
You guys might vote that I win this, or Devan.

138
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:56,081
Vote down below, let us know who wins

139
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:58,168
the left shark part of this contest.

140
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:00,501
- Next up: heart eyes emoji.

141
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,323
- Let's do it.

142
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,156
- Let's go.

143
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,331
- Let me see that.

144
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:11,935
The heart's already looking rather sussed right now.

145
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:15,065
- [Devan] Oh man, now they get all lopsided, shoot!

146
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:16,150
- [Collins] I had overspill.

147
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,172
- Yours is huge!

148
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,005
- I know!

149
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:21,172
- You're not gonna have enough yellow.

150
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:30,274
(intense music)

151
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:31,107
- Sorry

152
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,107
- Haters gonna hate bro.

153
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:36,727
That's one massive pancake.

154
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:38,208
It looks like you took the happy face emoji and

155
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,152
just slammed it into the pand.

156
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:41,152
- 3, 2...yay

157
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:46,261
- It's time to flip my massive pancake.

158
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:48,161
- Good luck, this is gonna be hard.

159
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:49,294
- 3, 2....

160
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:50,127
- [Together] Ooooooooooo!

161
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:52,794
- That was actually super smooth

162
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:56,434
- Heart eyes emoji: 3...

163
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:57,267
- No!

164
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,684
(slo-mo) Noooooooo

165
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:05,468
- 2, 1...

166
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,718
(laughter)

167
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:11,485
- Keep it on your plate bro.

168
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:14,146
Devan went for an unconventional blue eyes heart emoji

169
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:16,405
and I just kinda...

170
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:19,096
Comment down below who won this round.

171
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:21,455
This next one is super funny, you guys wanted us

172
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:24,455
to make Donald Trump...with pancakes

173
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:29,854
Let's do it.

174
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:33,907
- Mostly the hair that matters.

175
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:38,057
- [Collins] The hair is the main part of this whole thing.

176
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,807
You got some stylized art going on there bro.

177
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,625
(laughter)

178
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,124
- Quickly, fill it in.

179
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:04,624
- I'm laughing....

180
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:08,715
I can't fill it in because I'm crying.

181
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:11,298
- Already looks a little better

182
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,909
- Oh my gosh!

183
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:20,076
Sorry Mr. Trump, wow, it looks like a terrifying...

184
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:23,157
I'm literally crying I'm laughing so hard right now.

185
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:26,017
You did a phenominal job keeping those wisps in place...

186
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:27,734
Just like Donald Trump.

187
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,405
(rimshot)

188
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:30,238
Flip it.

189
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,397
Now comes the flip.

190
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:35,793
Most importantly is the hair.

191
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:37,047
His hair's comin off, it should never do that.

192
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:39,177
Trump's hair should never come off.

193
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:40,010
- Oh!

194
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,551
- It defies all logic!

195
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:44,171
- [Together] Nooooooooooo!

196
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:45,616
- The truth about Donald Trump's hair:

197
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:48,052
we'll flip the face first, we'll get the hair done

198
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:49,371
individually...don't worry Trump,

199
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,263
we'll put you back together.

200
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:52,990
- No, what just happened?

201
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,823
- Flip it, quick!

202
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:54,656
- Which way?

203
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:56,864
- You gotta get that....

204
00:08:56,864 --> 00:08:57,977
- Oh no!

205
00:08:57,977 --> 00:08:59,137
Oh no!

206
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:01,397
It's not in the flick of the wrist, I can't get this!

207
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:02,230
("Hail to the Chief")

208
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,284
- [Collins] There we go, okay.

209
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:07,238
Mine looks like a clown too.

210
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:10,854
Next is the hair, put the hair on like that.

211
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:12,313
- Now we know how he does his hair.

212
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:14,683
(air horn)

213
00:09:14,683 --> 00:09:15,850
- Donald Trump

214
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:18,102
- Or the Joker.

215
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,701
- Devan did not do too well on his.

216
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,369
- The red mouth was a mistake.

217
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:24,913
- This hair is not really attached.

218
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:26,818
- It's an accessory.

219
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:28,568
- It's an attachment.

220
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:33,099
Comment down below who won on Donald Trump.

221
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:34,488
Next pancake, let's do it.

222
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:36,619
Final round: you guys suggested that Devan and I:

223
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,536
we make each other out of pancakes.

224
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,463
Final round: begin!

225
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,009
- [Collins] I gotta give him some brows.

226
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:51,176
He has freckles and stuff, I'll give him green for freckles.

227
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,412
- I didn't even add a nose for you, I'm sorry.

228
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:05,245
Yeahhhh!

229
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:10,137
- Moment of truth: the flip of Devan's face.

230
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:11,720
Sounds kinda weird.

231
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,385
I don't know how this is gonna go.

232
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:17,535
I don't think I have the proper leverage

233
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:20,325
to do the proper flip...

234
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:21,158
Oh, yeah!

235
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,509
- That actually looks really good!

236
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:26,759
Actually looks really good!

237
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,874
- [Collins] It gives you a general line, relax.

238
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:36,004
No, no no...dude help me, the ear, get the ear.

239
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:38,330
You don't have it, it's just wobbling.

240
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,641
Here we go, the final round: portraits of each other.

241
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,013
3, 2, 1... bam.

242
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:47,071
- Wow...that's a masterpiece.
