00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,724
- What's up guys, it is Collins and as

2
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:04,598
you guys can tell, today I am outside

3
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:05,631
I would love to say I just came out here

4
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:06,809
because it was a lovely day, but

5
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:09,039
what really happened is I spent like

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,583
two hours today trying to light

7
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,313
this one area of my house.

8
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:13,415
It was not looking right.

9
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:14,518
I got really frustrated with that,

10
00:00:14,518 --> 00:00:15,813
and I took the camera outside

11
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:16,995
and I'm like, you know what?

12
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:18,892
this actually looks amazing right now.

13
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,551
For todays video I thought it would be

14
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:23,857
kind of fun to do some truths and some dares.

15
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,876
Basically I went on Twitter and

16
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:25,803
I asked you guys to tweet me

17
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:26,925
a whole bunch of truths and a whole

18
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:28,443
bunch of dares, because the last vlog I did,

19
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:30,042
my brother and I, we chucked eggs at each other

20
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:31,173
and they really hurt and you guys

21
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:32,803
seemed to enjoy that, so today I'm

22
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:34,052
gonna do some more crazy dares.

23
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:35,156
Let's get to it.

24
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:36,904
When was the last time you cried?

25
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,033
I don't really know how to answer this

26
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:39,649
because I am, I guess, like a more

27
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:41,058
sensitive guy.

28
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:43,326
It happened a few days, no I think it happened.

29
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:45,223
â™« About a week ago

30
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:46,661
Have you ever streaked?

31
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:48,332
I think I was like a baby I streaked a lot.

32
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:49,271
I think that's kind of a thing that a lot

33
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:50,104
of babies do.

34
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:51,798
Crack a raw egg over your head.

35
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:53,232
I brought along more than one egg

36
00:00:53,232 --> 00:00:54,277
because let's face it

37
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:56,185
I can't be basic like that.

38
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:57,352
Egg number uno

39
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,272
Uggghhhh.

40
00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:02,630
Two

41
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,463
Three.

42
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:05,875
All right, there you go.

43
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,291
Check it out, I got a mohawk!

44
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,124
What?

45
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:08,957
Oh yeah.

46
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:11,644
Next question.

47
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:13,144
Oh yeah, Chipotle!

48
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:18,710
I've been rejuvenated.

49
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,102
Thank you for the Chipotle by the way, bro.

50
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:22,181
Is there a person of interest in your life?

51
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:23,881
I think I know what you mean

52
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:25,972
I think I'm pickin' up what you're puttin' down

53
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:28,125
Sorry, that is a really weird way to phrase it.

54
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,233
By person of interest if you mean like a bae

55
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:33,351
or a girlfriend, no I don't have a girlfriend.

56
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:35,701
You know I just dropped my new single

57
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:36,534
it's me.

58
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:40,499
I'm single.

59
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,500
Do a backflip

60
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:50,658
Wait a minute, I gotta keep it real though

61
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:52,131
How did your parents come up with your name?

62
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:54,785
My great-grandpa, he was some big-time stock

63
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:56,956
investor who predicted the Great Depression

64
00:01:56,956 --> 00:02:00,219
and did a lot of cool stuff, so I was named

65
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,052
after him.

66
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:03,044
If you ever see someone type, like, Colin Keys,

67
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:06,030
like, be nice, but feel free to correct them.

68
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,596
I was at the mall, I forget where I was,

69
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:09,099
I was on tour somewhere with Demi, and this girl

70
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,465
runs up to me and she's like, oh my God,

71
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:12,055
you're Keys Colin!

72
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,555
From the X-Factor!

73
00:02:14,412 --> 00:02:16,079
And I was like, yes!

74
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:19,358
Who was the last person you texted?

75
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:20,494
Well, let's take a look here.

76
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:23,482
Jake Paul, and I said, okay, sounds dope.

77
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:26,202
Mix a spoonful of ketchup with water and then drink it

78
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:29,568
You know what, that's just not enough.

79
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:30,941
I thought maybe I'll use a bigger tablespoon

80
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:31,774
'cause I think this will work

81
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:33,605
a little bit better.

82
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:34,800
I still don't think that's enough.

83
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,334
You know what, this is extreme for an

84
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:37,917
extreme-dare video.

85
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,576
This is like 80% ketchup.

86
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,557
That looks so disgusting.

87
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:45,474
(electronic music)

88
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:58,431
Eww, that is so nasty.

89
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:05,929
This is so gross.

90
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,226
It smells so bad.

91
00:03:09,226 --> 00:03:12,736
I would literally throw up if I drank a couple more.

92
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:15,087
Have you ever been rejected?

93
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:16,103
That fly is crazy.

94
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:17,432
If you're talking about being rejected by

95
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:20,765
like a girl, no, but that's only because

96
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:24,166
I've never really asked a girl out.

97
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,248
I'm kind of shy in that way

98
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,119
Like, I can't just walk up to girls

99
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:30,755
and be like, Hey, I'm Collins.

100
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:31,707
You should give me your number.

101
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:32,779
Let's go on a date.

102
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:33,976
That's just not me.

103
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:36,106
I'm finally getting over my awkwardness around girls

104
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:38,075
I've been rejected by a couple girls,

105
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:39,297
like nonverbally.

106
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,960
There was this one girl I had a crush on

107
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,080
we were at the movie theater, there was like

108
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,867
eight other dudes and one girl and like

109
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:44,809
I'm sitting next to her, I was like

110
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:45,691
oh yeah!

111
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:48,535
I should probably put my arm around her, right?

112
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:50,123
I went yawn

113
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:51,551
and she just went

114
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:52,384
I'm like yee!

115
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:53,652
You know, just yeetin' over here

116
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:55,207
just not even trying to do this yee.

117
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,136
Look at your timeline and retweet the first

118
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,466
thing that you see.

119
00:03:58,466 --> 00:03:59,299
Bam, just did it.

120
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,357
I'll put the screenshot of the tweet

121
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:01,711
right around over here.

122
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:03,975
Do you creep on your fans' Twitter and Instagrams?

123
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:05,656
If you guys tweet me a lot, if you guys

124
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:07,288
constantly are tagging me in photos

125
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,833
there's a really, really, really good chance

126
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,818
that I've probably visited your profile before.

127
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,403
The moral of the story is, if you guys Tweet me

128
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,939
a lot and tag me in a ton of photos

129
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,282
I creep on your profile.

130
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:17,728
Yeah.

131
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,027
That's kind of how it works.

132
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:20,954
Tweet Nick Cannon and call him beautiful.

133
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:22,102
And, done.

134
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:23,805
The bromance has been renewed.

135
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,999
Why are you not using Vine anymore?

136
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:26,992
I'm definitely going to start making

137
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:27,895
a lot more Vines.

138
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:28,978
Have you had your first kiss?

139
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,090
Yes, I have had my first kiss

140
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,745
and I'm not gonna say with whom,

141
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:34,334
and I'm not gonna say when, where,

142
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:35,167
any details like that.

143
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeet.

144
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,577
Which YouTuber do you think would win the Hunger Games?

145
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,317
Jc Kaylen, mainly because of Wishbone.

146
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:43,317
Scream I'm a sexy pancake in public.

147
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:47,746
I'm a sexy pancake!

148
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,579
Whoo!

149
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,018
Whoo!

150
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:50,851
A sexy pancake, dawg!

151
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:52,179
Let's get a selfie, let's get a selfie!

152
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:53,837
Hey, hey, selfie!

153
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:55,335
Woo!

154
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:56,228
- Hey, I gotta call you back.

155
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:59,267
I don't know what's going on right now.

156
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:00,100
- Oh yeah!

157
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:04,476
Pancakes for the win!

158
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,771
I hate waffles!

159
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:08,762
I hate waffles!

160
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:09,595
Next question, let's move on.

161
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:10,821
Make this your last dare.

162
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:13,143
Dare accepted, and that's it for this week's

163
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:15,175

I'm gonna go disappear and eat some Chipotle.

170

Bye.

171
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:31,780
