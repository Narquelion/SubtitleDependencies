1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:02,416
- Yeah, yeah.

2
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:05,083
(crowd talking)

3
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:07,973
So now it's impossible to duplicate this card.

4
00:00:07,973 --> 00:00:10,678
So check this out right here.

5
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,178
Take your eight...

6
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:15,928
Put it like halfway in the middle right here.

7
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:17,208
This is where it gets crazy.

8
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,207
Watch this card right here.

9
00:00:20,207 --> 00:00:22,371
It'll find your card that's in a card watch.

10
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:23,562
One,

11
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:24,395
two,

12
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:28,670
melts all the way off the top right.

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,680
And it goes all the way through the deck.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,207
And look at this find your card

15
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:34,790
and you signed the front of it.

16
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:37,804
So watch if you go through,

17
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,011
one card has a bite out of it.

18
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:39,844
Do you see that?

19
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:40,707
- Who did it?

20
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,540
- Right.

21
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:45,351
- That's the card I thought.

22
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:47,121
- You picked the card you signed it right?

23
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:47,954
Okay.

24
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,224
- What?

25
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,260
- And that's not even the best part,

26
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,633
look at this.

27
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:55,614
What happens when you eat something,

28
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:56,877
where does it go?

29
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:57,710
- Stomach.

30
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,815
- Stomach right?

31
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:00,999
Well this is a cannibal card so watch this.

32
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:02,916
This right here, watch.

33
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,333
- Oh.

34
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,608
- It's inside of this card. - No it's not.

35
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,893
- Look at this. - Okay, I don't like this now.

36
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:11,853
I'm afraid. - Pull it out, pull it out.

37
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:14,114
pull it out take it all the way out.

38
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:14,947
It's really in there,

39
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:17,525
yeah take it all the way out.

40
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:20,025
Here's a little bit more here.

41
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:25,494
Make sure it fits that card exactly.

42
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:28,128
- I have to go.

43
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:30,053
- I don't like this, I don't like this.

44
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:31,303
- Crazy, right?

45
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,097
