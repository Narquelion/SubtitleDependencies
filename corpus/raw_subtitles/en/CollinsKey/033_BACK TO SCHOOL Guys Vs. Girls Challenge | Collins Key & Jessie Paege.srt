00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,072
- What's up, it's Collins Key, and for today's video,

2
00:00:02,072 --> 00:00:03,385
I have something very special planned.

3
00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:04,945
(Collins whooshing)

4
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:05,778
(Jessie snapping)

5
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:06,921
- Whoa!

6
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:07,754
Yo, guys this is crazy.

7
00:00:07,754 --> 00:00:10,095
I've never actually been teleported to someone else's video

8
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:11,486
for a collab, 'cause as you guys can tell,

9
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:13,517
this is not my background, right here.

10
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:14,350
- Very Jessie Paege.

11
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,882
- This is my friend Jessie.

12
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,308
So, first of all, if you guys haven't already subscribed

13
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,031
to her channel, go do that right now.

14
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:20,455
We put her links down in the description.

15
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:21,870
And also, we did a video over on her channel.

16
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,309
We're gonna put the link right over there.

17
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:24,791
So, after this video, go check that out.

18
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,718
But for today's video, since it's that time of year,

19
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:29,523
it's getting close to back to school, we are doing guys

20
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:32,107
versus girls back to school challenge.

21
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:33,467
Whoever wins the majority of the rounds,

22
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,328
that person wins this challenge.

23
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,666
They get to make the loser do something very embarrassing

24
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,978
on their SnapChat.

25
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:40,725
We're gonna have the video of that at the end of this,

26
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,228
so make sure you guys stick around to the very end.

27
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:43,061
- Oh, my gosh, really?

28
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:43,894
I'm scared.

29
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:44,727
(both laughing)

30
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:45,560
Squad, all right.

31
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,279
We are going to kill the like button and just, you know.

32
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:49,122
- Yeah, annihilate it.

33
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:50,660
The way she said it was so soft and gentle, like,

34
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,911
we're gonna kill the like button.

35
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:52,744
- Kill it.

36
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:53,717
- While I'm like, "Yo, we're gonna go at this like button!"

37
00:00:53,717 --> 00:00:54,554
No, yeah.

38
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,100

00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,900

have you ever done a messy video before?

43
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:06,740
- No, but I will ruin the pink hair,

44
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,745
and that's saying a lot, 'cause this is my everything.

45
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:08,578
- Oh, my god.

46
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:09,411

71
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:51,649
back to school challenge.

72
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:53,183
I'mma juggle these things to start this off,

73
00:01:53,183 --> 00:01:54,016
'cause we need energy.

74
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:55,205
- Oh, my gosh, you're so good.

75
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:56,038
- Let's get this started.

76
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:59,126
Round number one, a friend of ours put a whole bunch

77
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:00,144
of random stuff in these backpacks,

78
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:01,891
and hidden amongst them are three things

79
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,061
that we have to find.

80
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:05,862
Scissors, a pencil sharpener, and a glue stick,

81
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:07,719
and whoever can find all these items first,

82
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,175
they win round one.

83
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:10,669
Three, two, one, go!

84
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,836
I shouldn't a zipped them closed, okay here we go.

85
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:18,137
- Hey, hey, hey!

86
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:22,054
(Jessie clapping and laughing)

87
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:24,800
- What?

88
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,243
Yo, I'm not gonna say my friend rigged this

89
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:28,372
or anything, but my friend has rigged this.

90
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:29,205
What just happened?

91
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:31,099
- Actually, I have a secret power,

92
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,433
no I'm kidding.

93
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:33,504
- Hey, I'll take the loss.

94
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:34,777
I'll take it, I lose round one, so.

95
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:35,610
- Sorry.

96
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,569
- Congratulations, you win round one.

97
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,437
And a fun thing to add is that every round you win,

98
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:40,316
you get to put on one of these apple stickers.

99
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:42,304
'Cause, I guess, you give a teacher apples.

100
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,888
- If only I was healthy enough to eat one of these.

101
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:45,076
(Collins laughing)

102
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:46,972
- So, you get your first official apple sticker.

103
00:02:46,972 --> 00:02:48,848
Awe, so cute.

104
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:50,061
That is round number one.

105
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:52,465
Let me actually find my freaking pencil sharpener now.

106
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,608
It's got be here somewhere.

107
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:55,864
Oh, there we go, at the bottom of all the pen's

108
00:02:55,864 --> 00:02:56,802
the sharpener.

109
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,668
So, for round, we've made such a mess.

110
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:00,854
For round number two, whoever can sharpen their pencil

111
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:04,464
the most in 30 seconds, they win that round, so.

112
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:05,612
Set timer for 30--

113
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:06,445
- [Siri] What was that again?

114
00:03:06,445 --> 00:03:07,614
- I didn't even start yet.

115
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:09,697
Set timer for 30 seconds.

116
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,157
- [Siri] Okay, your timer is set--

117
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:14,061
- Oh, gee, it's going.

118
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,598
(Jessie yells)

119
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:16,796
I need to figure out a system for this.

120
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:17,942
- Oh, gees.

121
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:19,174
- I feel like I'm breaking mine, okay.

122
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,088
Whoo.

123
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,124
Oh, we only have 10 seconds left.

124
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:24,216
This like a wrist workout, man, ow.

125
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:27,171
Three, two, one, and stop.

126
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:28,291
(Jessie laughing)

127
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,379
Okay, what happened?

128
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:33,547
(both laughing)

129
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,609
I think it's kinda clear who won this,

130
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:36,544
no there's no technical difficulty.

131
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:37,798
- Me, obviously, yeah.

132
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:41,063
This is clearly a great, oh gosh, help me.

133
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:41,896
(Jessie laughing)

134
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:43,587
- So now we are tied, and now I get my very own

135
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:45,477
apple sticker, and I'm going for the--

136
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:46,310
- Put it on your cheek.

137
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,143
- For you.

138
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:48,854
I don't know if I can do it.

139
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,521
Upon further reconsideration, I don't think,

140
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,542
it doesn't work for me.

141
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,182
So, I'm gonna be baller with it.

142
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:55,015
- Wear it like a man.

143
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:56,351
- Come at me, bro, come at me.

144
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,983
For round number three, we have to put as many loose

145
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:00,626
leaf papers in these paper protectors as possible

146
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:01,761
in 45 seconds.

147
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:03,648
Whoever can do that wins round three

148
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:06,034
and will take the lead, so here we go.

149
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:08,746
Hey, Siri, put 45 seconds on the clock for me,

150
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:09,729

151
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,095

152
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:14,265
for put 45 seconds on the clock for me will ya fam.

153
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:15,098
- [Both] Will ya fam.

154
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:16,247
- Will ya fam, no. - Isn't that...

155
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:17,080
- Okay, let me do it again.

156
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,213
Hey, Siri--

157
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:19,713
- [Siri] Sorry Collins, I didn't get that.

158
00:04:19,713 --> 00:04:20,546
- Oh, shady.

159
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:21,930
Hey, Siri, 45 seconds on the clock.

160
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,763
Do it.

161
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,675
- [Siri] 22.5.

162
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:26,569
(Collins laughing)

163
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,986
- Hey, Siri, 45 second timer.

164
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:32,858
- [Siri] Done, I love a good countdown.

165
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:33,704
- All right, let's go, let's go.

166
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:34,871
- Oh, my gosh.

167
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:38,111
I feel like I'm gonna fail at this miserably.

168
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,028
- It's stressful to do.

169
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,830
I'm assuming you don't do a lot of--

170
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,997
- In, in!

171
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,822
Okay, there we go, boom, one.

172
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:46,951
- Oh, wait, you have to go one in each?

173
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:47,784
- Yeah, one in each.

174
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:48,617
- Oh.

175
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:49,733
- Oh, you're trying to put 'em all.

176
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,030
Oh, I see how it is.

177
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,316
Where's the opening of this, there we go.

178
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:54,851
- Okay, I'm not winning this at all.

179
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:56,387
- Here we go.

180
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:58,412
(Collins panting)

181
00:04:58,412 --> 00:04:59,843
I need one more!

182
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:01,396
- Wait, ah, where's the opening?

183
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:02,229
Okay.

184
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,288
(Collins exhaling)

185
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:06,121
Just go, no!

186
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:07,457
Kay, how many did you do?

187
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:08,489
- One.

188
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:09,864
- One, okay.

189
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:10,697
I got two.

190
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:12,990
So, I'll take round three.

191
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,823
I get one more apple.

192
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,565
That was the most stressful thing of all time.

193
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,477
Trying to get them open was so--

194
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:17,310
- Right?

195
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,244
It was like something about it was cringey.

196
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:19,802
Like something about putting it in there was like

197
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:21,521
eh, like nails on a chalkboard.

198
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,088
- Cringey is the best word to use to describe this.

199
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:25,481
I'm going green apple for this one, and I'm

200
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:26,913
gonna do matching, bam.

201
00:05:26,913 --> 00:05:28,565
Round four, let's get it.

202
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:30,208
And we're going on to round number four,

203
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,614
and this one here involves locks, because you guys know

204
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:34,087
you have locks on your locker.

205
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:36,589
So, for this challenge, whoever can unlock their lock

206
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,392
the fastest wins.

207
00:05:38,392 --> 00:05:39,225
So, here's what we're gonna do.

208
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:40,058
Locks on the table.

209
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,418
- Here, we'll mix it up first.

210
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:42,835
- Oh, okay, okay.

211
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:45,705
You good?

212
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:46,538
- We're all good.

213
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:47,371
- Hands on the table.

214
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:49,905
Here we go, three, hands on the table.

215
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:50,738
Two.

216
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:51,712
- Sorry, I had to flip my hair.

217
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:53,212
- Two, one, begin.

218
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:55,805
Um, it is--

219
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,591
- This is my workout for today.

220
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,424
- 14.

221
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,662
What was the last one?

222
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,495
Eight.

223
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:04,328
- Bam!

224
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:05,161
- No!

225
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:05,994
- Oh, yeah.

226
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:06,827
- No!

227
00:06:06,827 --> 00:06:07,660
- That's 'cause--

228
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,493
- Wait, mine didn't even...

229
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,163
- You were homeschooled.

230
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,916
(Jessie laughing)

231
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:12,858
- Ho, ho!

232
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:14,949
We are tied now, going into round number five.

233
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:15,917
The tie-breaker round.

234
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,752
Whoever wins this round gets to have the loser do

235
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,322
something super embarrassing on SnapChat.

236
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:21,785
So, first of all, pick an apple.

237
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,319
- I wanna keep it consistent.

238
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,502
- Awe.

239
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:26,408
(Jessie mumbles)

240
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:27,569
This really is boys versus girls.

241
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:28,402
- Game time.

242
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:29,235
- Girls like, on the cheek, it's so cute.

243
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:31,459
I'm like, "Man patches with my apples."

244
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,292
All right, here we go.

245
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,368
This is the tie-breaker round,

246
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:36,651
and for this last one, we have to make a sandwich.

247
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:38,162
Fully complete the sandwich.

248
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:39,591
We don't have Ziploc bags, so we're gonna put it

249
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,182
in one of the page protectors.

250
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:42,159
And then, you have to seal it, oh why is there lettuce

251
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,111
in here?

252
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:43,944
(Jessie laughing)

253
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:47,185
And then you have to put it inside of your lunch box.

254
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:48,682
Zip it all the way up, and whoever does that first

255
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:50,264
wins the final round.

256
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:54,971
Loser has to do some embarrassing things on SnapChat.

257
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:56,431
We'll put the video of that at the end of this challenge.

258
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:57,264
- Oh, my god.

259
00:06:57,264 --> 00:06:59,097
- Three, two, one, go!

260
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:02,642
But that tear, doe.

261
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:04,142
- Oh, I would do anything for the carbs.

262
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:05,173
- This is making me hungry, too, 'cause I haven't

263
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,044
eaten all day, yet.

264
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:06,877
- Oh, really?

265
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:07,926
- All right, there we go.

266
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,278
Tasteful amount of mustard, not too much.

267
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:10,111
- Um.

268
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:11,448
(Collins groans)

269
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:12,553
Whoa, my tomatoes.

270
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:14,670
(both laughing)

271
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,440
Just squeezing it?

272
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,228
There we go, bam, tomato.

273
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:19,288
Ah, what else do I need on there?

274
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:20,455
Lettuce, okay.

275
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:24,444
No, no.

276
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,956
So, I'm good, okay, here we go, boom.

277
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:26,789
- No, no, no, no.

278
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:27,622
- Yes.

279
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:28,495
- Ah, ah, ah!

280
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:30,042
He's missing cheese.

281
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:30,875
- No!

282
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:31,818
- And guess who has the cheese?

283
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,063
- No, give me the cheese.

284
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:34,845
Give me the cheese!

285
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,595
This is unfair, okay.

286
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:39,880
- That's my slice.

287
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,713
- Ah, no.

288
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:42,400
(Jessie laughing)

289
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,725
And you threw it so far, too.

290
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:45,641
All right, here we, no, no, no, no, no, no.

291
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:46,474
Okay.

292
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,360
I lost my tomato.

293
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,354
Bam, I won!

294
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:51,187
Yes!

295
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:52,020
- No, you have to zip it!

296
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,853
You gotta zip it!

297
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:53,686
- Wait you can't zip it.

298
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:54,519
- Yes, you can.

299
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,187
- Wait, zip, no, no, no, no.

300
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:58,285
Wait, wait.

301
00:07:58,285 --> 00:07:59,118
- Yes, whoo!

302
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:00,487
- No, that was not zipped up.

303
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:01,936
That was the exact same time.

304
00:08:01,936 --> 00:08:03,059
- Wow.

305
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:04,631
Well, that went zero to 100 real quick.

306
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:05,800
So, I think.

307
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,633
- That was a tie.

308
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:07,466
- 'Cause that was a tie--

309
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,966
- Look what I did.

310
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:12,801
- We're both, for this, gonna do embarrassing things

311
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:13,634
on our SnapChat.

312
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:14,467
- You said you didn't eat all day.

313
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:15,300
Do you want this?

314
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,133
- I'm good.

315
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:16,966
I'm good.

316
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:17,815
So, right now, we're 'bout to do some embarrassing things

317
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:18,921
on our SnapChat.

318
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,250
But, yeah.

319
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,379
- Should we say what we're both gonna do?

320
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,550
- Oh, I tried the mustard, that was gross.

321
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,383
(Jessie laughing)

322
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,540
- I believe in mermaids!

323
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,207
And you should, too!

324
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:43,402
- If you haven't already added us on SnapChat,

325
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:45,205
you are missing out on fun things just like that.

326
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:46,585
So, make sure you guys go add us right now.

327
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,185
- This now on us embarrassing ourselves.

328
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:49,793
- Yeah, so go add us on SnapChat,

329
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:50,890
'cause you do not wanna miss that.

330
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,173
Make sure you guys go check out the video

331
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:53,006
that we did on her channel.

332
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:54,223
I'm gonna put the link right over there.

333
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:55,409
Also down in the description.

334
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,363
Subscribe to her.

335
00:08:56,363 --> 00:08:57,553
Right now, I have to go teleport back

336
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:58,836
to my home, so bye!

337
00:08:58,836 --> 00:08:59,669
(Collins snapping)

338
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,707
- Well, this is awkward.

339
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,110
Hi, welcome to Collins' channel,

340
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,170
and Jessie Paege is taking over, dun, dun, dun.

341
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,193
(high energy music)
