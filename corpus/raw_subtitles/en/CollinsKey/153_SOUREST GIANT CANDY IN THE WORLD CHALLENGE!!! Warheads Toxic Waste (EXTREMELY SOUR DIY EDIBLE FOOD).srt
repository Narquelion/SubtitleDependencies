1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
(crushing)

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,330
- Oh my gosh!

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,280
You challenged us to another giant sour candy video.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,630
Devin, close your eyes.

5
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,463
- Okay.

6
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:09,980
- Holy cow, this thing is huge.

7
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,813
- What is huge?

8
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:12,850
- Now I gotta open it up, keep your eyes closed!

9
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,683
- Open what?

10
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:14,516
- Yay!

11
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:15,349
Yay!

12
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,182
This is.

13
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,015
(heavenly music)

14
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:18,690
Yo, this is insane.

15
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,850
Keep your eyes closed,

16
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,710
and you have to guess what candy this is.

17
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,940
It's right in front of you.

18
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,950
Lean forward, you'll get it.

19
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,020
There you go.

20
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,250
- Oh man.

21
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,880
But bro, this could be, like, any kind of chocolate ever.

22
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,000
- Dude, it's got a very specific name to it, Devin.

23
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,918
Take another bite, take another bite, maybe.

24
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:36,080
(laughing)

25
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,190
- All right, I'm gonna go with Crunch Bar.

26
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,444
- No! (buzzer buzzing)

27
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:40,640
- Did I get it? - No.

28
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,667
You can open up your eyes.

29
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,720
Ta-da!

30
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,990
Because you lost,

31
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,180
you now have to eat a sour candy

32
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,110
from the Bag of Doom.

33
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,140
- Wait, what?

34
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,330
- All right, so here it is,

35
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,163
the sour candy-- - What?

36
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:52,060
There's so many of them. - Choices, Devin.

37
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,630
- I guess I'll just go with- wow, this is way heavier

38
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,530
than I thought it would be.

39
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,800
Wait, what?

40
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,510
They're, like, bananas. (laughing)

41
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,410
- I mean, have you never had a sour banana before?

42
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,243
- No, have you?

43
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:02,076
- No.

44
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:04,350
- Bro, these are so squishy and weird.

45
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,890
- Devin, you now get the Necklace of Shame.

46
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,723
- Wait, what?

47
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:08,556
This again?

48
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:09,750
I feel so shamed. (laughing)

49
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,850
All right, here we go.

50
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:15,838
Oh, gosh.

51
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:16,671
(laughing)

52
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:18,090
- So guys, right over here, we also have

53
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,860
the Cereal Bowl of Sourness.

54
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,930
I'm gonna put these in here.

55
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,057
- All right, we have this next-

56
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:22,980
- Ow!

57
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,010
I am so scared.

58
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,640
- This is what we have next.

59
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,810
Oh my gosh.

60
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,470
- What is it?

61
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,520
- It's like hair.

62
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,620
It's almost like he's going through a carwash.

63
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,453
- Ah!

64
00:01:33,453 --> 00:01:34,870
Ah, ah, ha.

65
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,220
- Dude, you're so paranoid.

66
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,053
- Yeah!

67
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:37,886
- All right, just calm down

68
00:01:37,886 --> 00:01:39,050
and stick out your tongue.

69
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:43,149
Do you get anything?

70
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,220
Any taste?

71
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,053
What are you doing?

72
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:46,650
All right, I'll just hold it out like this.

73
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,340
Go for it.

74
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,260
Any guesses yet?

75
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,093
(bell dinging)

76
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:54,260
Oh, what, no, no no!

77
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,830
Don't turn so quickly!

78
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,021
- Twizzlers!

79
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:58,610
Did I get it? - Yeah!

80
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,910
Look at all these, dude.

81
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,080
- This is the longest Twizzler I've ever seen

82
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,954
in my entire life.

83
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:04,440
Yo, yo, yo you need to stop.

84
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,430
And because I guessed it correctly, Devin,

85
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,440
you have to eat a sour candy,

86
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,273
so choose

87
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:10,280
a Bag of Doom.

88
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,180
- I guess I'll just go with this one.

89
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,480
- Oh man, let's see what it is.

90
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,410
- Oh, wait, what?

91
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,243
- What are those?

92
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:17,400
- They look really sour.

93
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,680
- I have no clue what those are,

94
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,750
but those look like they're gonna burst in your mouth

95
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,360
with just a whole bunch of sour flavor.

96
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,130
- They're like little clouds.

97
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,963
- Of doom.

98
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:26,820
- Dude, I hate sour candy.

99
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,670
All right, here we go.

100
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,540
Three, two, one-

101
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,373
- Wait, wait, wait, first!

102
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:31,240
Five second subscribe challenge.

103
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,490

104
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,069

Are you ready?

107
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,660
Five,

108
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,493
four,

109
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,326
three,

110
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,410
two,

111
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,243
one,

112
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:43,076
done.

113
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:43,909
Comment down below keep (mumbles).

114
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:44,810
- Comment down below. - If you were able to do that.

115
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,020
And we can't forget, of course,

116
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,820
about the Necklace of Shame.

117
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,310
- No, I thought you forgot, too.

118
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,143
Darn it. - There we go.

119
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:51,020
Perfect. - No, no.

120
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,853
Here we go.

121
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:52,686
Three,

122
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:53,519
two,

123
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,352
one.

124
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,104
(laughing)

125
00:02:58,104 --> 00:03:00,510
- Oh dude, no, they're falling out of your mouth!

126
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,005
Oh my gosh, they're so gross.

127
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,905
- Oh man! - Holy cow, is it sour?

128
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:04,738
- Oh, yeah.

129
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:06,190
- Ha ha!

130
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,570
I'm glad I didn't get this one.

131
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,430
The Cereal of Doom,

132
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,626
we're gonna put some of these in here.

133
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:10,950
Dude, they're wet.

134
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,850
You spit them out and they're wet.

135
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,683
(bell dinging) Here it is,

136
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:14,830
the next candy for this next round.

137
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,850
Devin, keep your eyes closed.

138
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,960
- They totally are closed.

139
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,980
- Three, two, one.

140
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,590
- Ow, what was that?

141
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,423
- I must admit,

142
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:24,200
I thought it was going to be a giant version of this,

143
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,373
not just one's going ah! - Wait, what are these?

144
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,206
(glass breaking)

145
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,039
- That was loud.

146
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,930
- Open up your mouth.

147
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:33,940
- Ow!

148
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,980
- Oh my gosh,

149
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,813
are you okay?

150
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:36,990
- I thought I chipped a tooth.

151
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,330
- Bro, I thought you did, too.

152
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,159
Are you okay?

153
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,390
- Hold on, I think I know these.

154
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,930
Oh, Airheads.

155
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,763
- Yep!

156
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:44,596
There you go.

157
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:45,429
- They're sticky.

158
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,620
- Finally, I don't have to pick one of these bags,

159
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,453
and it's you.

160
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:50,720
All right, I'm gonna take this-

161
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,290
This one is heavy!

162
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,243
What is in there?

163
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:55,580
- It sounds like a rock.

164
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,240
- Yo, these are like-

165
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,370
- Control yourself.

166
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,800
(clanking)

167
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,990
- This thing is green,

168
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,280
which means it might be actually really sour.

169
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,940
Three, two, one.

170
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,460
- Whoa, dude, don't choke!

171
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,010
Whoa, dude, are you okay?

172
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:12,950
Oh, no!

173
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:16,117
That wasn't a lot.

174
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,644
That was like one lick, bro.

175
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:20,634
Oh, your tongue is turning green!

176
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,146
Is it actually that sour?

177
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:24,313
(yelling)

178
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,580
- Oh my gosh!

179
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,990
- All right, we have the next one here.

180
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,329
Collins, your eyes are still closed, I assume.

181
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:30,162
- Yes.

182
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:30,995
I'm so scared.

183
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:33,190
- Dude, this looks crazy.

184
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,198
Can you smell it yet?

185
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:35,164
Can you smell it yet?

186
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:36,800
Can you smell it?

187
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,680
- I got a whiff of chocolate.

188
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,690
- All right, you ready?

189
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,523
- No.

190
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:41,381
- Bro, what are you doing?

191
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,780
Just bite down on it.

192
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,613
This is just,

193
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:47,120
ah.

194
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,108
Sorry.

195
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:48,941
(laughing)

196
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:51,104
- Oh, oh, Mars Bar.

197
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:51,937
- No!

198
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:53,060
It is not.

199
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,310
It's a Snickers bar.

200
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,350
- I do not like these Bags of Doom.

201
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,436
- I'm so excited right now.

202
00:04:58,436 --> 00:04:59,586
- It's getting lighter.

203
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:01,824
No!

204
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,820
- Oh, those are so sour. - Dude, these are crazy!

205
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,790
- Guess who's going for it?

206
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,780
Three,

207
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,613
two,

208
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:08,446
one.

209
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:10,705
- Oh!

210
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,493
Are you okay?

211
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:16,356
You're like a Pez dispenser.

212
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:17,976
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

213
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:19,080
- All right, add 'em in.

214
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:21,198
Payback!

215
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:22,031
- Ow!

216
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:22,864
What was that?

217
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,800
- Yo, this looks crazy.

218
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,900
- I'm so curious

219
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,733
and nervous.

220
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:27,566
- Oh my gosh!

221
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:29,060
Can I eat this? - No, no you can't.

222
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,430
- This looks so good.

223
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,350
- This is for me.

224
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,183
What are you doing?

225
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:33,050
Oh my gosh, I feel like a mustache.

226
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,883
- You gotta mustache.

227
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:34,980
Oh, come on.

228
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,840
- Mm, this is so good.

229
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,120
Oh my goodness.

230
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,953
Wow.

231
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:39,786
- What do you think it is?

232
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,030
- I have no idea.

233
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,420
Pop rocks? - Nope.

234
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,640
Nerds Rope, Devin.

235
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,473
- A what?

236
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:45,306
- Open up your eyes, bro.

237
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,020
Look at how cool this thing is.

238
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,853
- Whoa.

239
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:50,510
- But because you could not guess what this is,

240
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,890
let's see what you got.

241
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,180
Dude, look at all that malic acid, bro.

242
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,750
You got it all over the table.

243
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,480
Dude, those are gonna be terrible.

244
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,840
- All right, here we go.

245
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,690
Three,

246
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,523
two,

247
00:06:03,523 --> 00:06:04,410
one-- - Wait, wait, wait, first.

248
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,440
Three second like challenge.

249
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,450
Three,

250
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,310
two,

251
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,143
one,

252
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:09,140
done. - Here we go.

253
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:11,686
Ow.

254
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:12,796
Way worse.

255
00:06:12,796 --> 00:06:13,910
(laughing)

256
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,980
- Are you good?

257
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,170
What's happening, bro?

258
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,090
- Whoa.

259
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,070
- We got the sour cereal,

260
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,590
we'll get some malic acid in there.

261
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,560
That's mine, that's mine, that's mine,

262
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,393
That's good, that's good.

263
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:24,430
Here we go, the Necklace of Shame.

264
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,120
- Nope, that round is over!

265
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,953
Denied.

266
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:27,786
All right, Collins,

267
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:28,619
for this next round.

268
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,880
Bro, bro-- - I'm so scared

269
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,370
with my eyes closed around you.

270
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,650
- You're already in a good stance,

271
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,830
because this next one,

272
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,690
you are not allowed to use your taste buds.

273
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,950
You must use one of your other five senses,

274
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,720
which is karate.

275
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,553
- What?

276
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:41,386
- Just start swingin',

277
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:43,020
karate choppin'.

278
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,853
You totally missed.

279
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:45,640
- Ow!

280
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,479
Ow!

281
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,510
Ow!

282
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,580
- This isn't working out as well as I thought it would.

283
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,340
No, no, no, dude, you can stop.

284
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,290
I think I left the cardboard under it.

285
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,123
- Cardboard?

286
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,591
In candy?

287
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:56,762
Whoa, geez!

288
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:57,595
- All right,

289
00:06:57,595 --> 00:06:58,428
three, two, one.

290
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,530
- Ow! I know what it is.

291
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,080
- What? - It's a Rice Krispy Treat.

292
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,913
- No! - Oh yeah!

293
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:04,702
- I wanna take a bit of this thing,

294
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:05,535
this thing's crazy.

295
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:06,510
- Oh no.

296
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,970
Sour gummy bears.

297
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,920
Oh, dude.

298
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,040
What?

299
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,110
Three,

300
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,943
two,

301
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:14,776
one.

302
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,140
- Why would you do that?

303
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,973
- I blocked it.

304
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:19,806
Did you see that? - Holy cow.

305
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,270
That was pretty impressive.

306
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,190
We have the Necklace of Shame.

307
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,023
- Why does it do that?

308
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:26,060
- I guess we gotta put it in the cereal now.

309
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,310
Next round, let's go.

310
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,990
- All right, Collins, this next one is

311
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,210
very large

312
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,720
and very hairy.

313
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,553
- What?

314
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,450
I've never heard of a hairy candy before.

315
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,570
What are you doing?

316
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,080
- I'm trying to get it out of the package,

317
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,913
it's that big.

318
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:38,746
And it bites.

319
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:40,680
It bites really badly.

320
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,690
All right, you ready for it?

321
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,523
Three,

322
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:43,356
two,

323
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:44,295
one,

324
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,493
and he goes for the bite.

325
00:07:45,493 --> 00:07:46,326
- That hurt.

326
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:47,159
- Just go out and bite.

327
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,000
Leap of faith, bro.

328
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,833
You got this.

329
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,660
Your lips look hilarious, bro.

330
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,173
- Gummy snake,

331
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,006
a gummy snake!

332
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:58,115
- Yes! - Yes!

333
00:07:58,115 --> 00:07:59,530
- It's not a gummy snake, bro.

334
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm celebrating-- - Oh no!

335
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,553
- Hairy?

336
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:03,386
A bear?

337
00:08:03,386 --> 00:08:04,550
- Oh, and every round,

338
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,383
I've forgotten about the

339
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:07,504
Necklace of Shame.

340
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:09,370
That's right.

341
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,203
Sorry.

342
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:11,510
Here, I'm gonna choose this one for you.

343
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,202
- Oh, my gosh.

344
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,160
It looks like bubble gum.

345
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,150
- You can't take that one.

346
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,533
We gotta give you a worse one, dude.

347
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:17,366
- What? No.

348
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,581
- How 'bout this one here?

349
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,120
(screaming)

350
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,460
- There's a string in it!

351
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,293
Here we go,

352
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,126
three,

353
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:23,963
two,

354
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:24,796
one.

355
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:27,910
Ow, ow, ow.

356
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,220
- Dude, are you okay?

357
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,230
Will this soothe you?

358
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,710
Do you want some of that?

359
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,430
Not a good combo?

360
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,263
- Ow!

361
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,096
I bit down really hard.

362
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,200
- All right, add it to the cereal.

363
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,780
- There we go.

364
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,613
- Aw, missed.

365
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:40,446
- This one, Devin.

366
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:41,279
- Yeah?

367
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,112
- Good luck.

368
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:45,610
- That is paper.

369
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,550
- Open up your mouth.

370
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,383
Three, two, one.

371
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,080
Ow, you bit my thumb.

372
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,260
Devin bit my thumb.

373
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,093
- Oh!

374
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:54,020
I have no idea.

375
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,914
It tastes like some sort of buttons or something.

376
00:08:56,914 --> 00:08:58,230
- That's it!

377
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,230
Jumbo buttons.

378
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,063
- No, really?

379
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:00,896
- Well done.

380
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:01,740
I'm not happy about this.

381
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,930
All right, I'm gonna take this one here.

382
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,810
- All right, go for it.

383
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,790
Oh, and can't forget the Necklace of Shame.

384
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,840
- Okay be careful, be careful.

385
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,070
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

386
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,270
- You're really bad at putting it on.

387
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,800
- Let's see what we got.

388
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,960
Sour Lifesaver thingies.

389
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,400
This is not a Lifesaver.

390
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,040
This has got to be somethin' else, man.

391
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,873
Here we go.

392
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:17,706
Three,

393
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:18,539
two,

394
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:19,372
one.

395
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:23,170
- I'm just gonna take one of these.

396
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:24,912
Here we go,

397
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:26,700
we're gonna add these in to the cereal.

398
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,780
These are really good.

399
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,200
All right, and next up,

400
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,630
we have these Reese's-

401
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,930
I mean. (record screeching)

402
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,330
- Did you just give it away?

403
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,720
- No, no I did not.

404
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,310
Nope, did not give it away at all.

405
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,500
- I smell peanut butter.

406
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,070
I know exactly what this is.

407
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,600
- I don't think there's anything I could do

408
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,870
to mask the smell,

409
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,260
other than put a lollipop under your nose.

410
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,610
Oh my gosh, these come in,

411
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,010
like, a cake platter.

412
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,763
- Stop.

413
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:49,770
Please stop touching my nose with it.

414
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,603
I'll stay really still.

415
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:51,820
- We're flyin' in.

416
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,040
- All I smell is peanut butter.

417
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,100
Give me the Reese's,

418
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,210
and I can tell you it's Reese's

419
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,330
and then I will win this challenge.

420
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,990
- But it's not Reese's at all.

421
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,080
It's this, here,

422
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,913
taste it.

423
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:00,840
- Ah, ah, ah.

424
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,050
- See, it's not Reese's, bro.

425
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,210
- That was, like, that hurt.

426
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,043
What was that?

427
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:05,100
- I feel like the jig is up,

428
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,550
dude, you can smell peanut butter.

429
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,810
- This looks incredible.

430
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,643
- Go for it.

431
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,140
What happened?

432
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
You got none of the Reese's Pieces-ness.

433
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,900
- It's so good!

434
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,220
- Dude, you keep on spilling it.

435
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,053
- The Necklace of Shame.

436
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,310
You must wear it again.

437
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,549
- I knew this was coming.

438
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:22,700
- And now, Devin,

439
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,690
choose your sour candy.

440
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,340
- All right, I got it, this is my bag.

441
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,450
What did I get?

442
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,320
Oh no!

443
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,170
This could probably be the worst one I think

444
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,003
we've ever gotten.

445
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:32,000
- Dude, those look like they're lemon flavored, for sure.

446
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,980
- Oh, and the malic acid.

447
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,090
- There's so much.

448
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,923
- All right, here we go.

449
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:35,756
Three,

450
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:36,589
two,

451
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:37,422
one.

452
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:41,224
Whoa.

453
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,510
It's probably the most sour thing I've ever had.

454
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,740
- Let's add them to the bowl right now.

455
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,720
This one here is massive.

456
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,310
This is at least 12 times the normal.

457
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,790
All the way out, all the way out.

458
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,623
- Ew.

459
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:55,110
- And then bite down.

460
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,630
- I can't.

461
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,820
- My teeth are stuck.

462
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:02,152
Oh!

463
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:02,985
Tastes like chocolate.

464
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:04,360
It tastes like another Hershey's.

465
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,140
You didn't give me another Hershey's

466
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,280
to throw me off, did you?

467
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,160
- What is it, Devin?

468
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,210
- It's a Hershey's bar.

469
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,420
- No.

470
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,410
You didn't get it!

471
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,243
- What?

472
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:13,680
- It's a Hershey's kiss.

473
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,670
So, you lost by just a little bit.

474
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,503
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

475
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:17,690
we should let them decide.

476
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,220
Comment down below if you think I got that right.

477
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,053
- I don't think you did,

478
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:22,490
so choose a bag, Devin.

479
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,810
- Wait, what are these?

480
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,180
I can't even squeeze it.

481
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,220
- They're, like, super hard.

482
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,310
- That's not a good sign.

483
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,130
- Yeah, no, that's not good at all.

484
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,963
Oh my gosh!

485
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,653
- Oh, wow,

486
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:33,680
these get sweet really fast though.

487
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,610
- Try another one.

488
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,010
- You're not chipping another tooth, bro.

489
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,380
- So I'm gonna add these to the cereal

490
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,460
and, so far, Devin's the one losing this challenge.

491
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,650
Of course, the Necklace of Shame.

492
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,483
There we go.

493
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:43,770
So Devin, you lost the challenge

494
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,300
which means you need to eat the most sour bowl of cereal

495
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,430
in the entire world.

496
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,350
- Dude, it looks so sour.

497
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,500
- Yeah, it's gonna blow your taste buds out of your mouth.

498
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,720
- Your expectations might be a little too high.

499
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,410
I wanna bring it down just a little bit.

500
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,680
Wait, bro, but where's the milk?

501
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,000
There's milk in cereal right?

502
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,833
- For the milk,

503
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,940
we've got sour soda.

504
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,830
- Wait, no.

505
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,750
- Exactly.

506
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,583
Here we go,

507
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,000
we're gonna add in the sour soda.

508
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:08,955
Oh, snap.

509
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:09,800
Here we go.

510
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,910
The sourest bowl of cereal in the entire world.

511
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,750
Take your bite.

512
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,030
- This looks crazy.

513
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,190
- Oh, dude, the banana!

514
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,230
- Oh I forgot about the banana!

515
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,063
- The banana!

516
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:20,820
- The beginning of my journey.

517
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,270
- Beginning of your journey

518
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,160
to failure.

And right now, Devin, go for it.

523

You ready?

524
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:31,205
- All right,

525
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,038

two,

527
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:33,704
one.

528
00:12:34,716 --> 00:12:36,140
- Oh, my gosh.

529
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,550
Holy cow.

Bye!

543
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,420
- It's so sour.

544
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,820
- Dude, are you okay? - No.
