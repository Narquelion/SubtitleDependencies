1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,461
- You challenged us, Oh my gosh!

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,717
To make DIY edible Christmas presents

3
00:00:04,717 --> 00:00:06,400
that you can literally eat.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,789
Right now, we're kicking it off with Christmas trees.

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:10,710
(spits out food)

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,008
Gotta open up the butter.

7
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:14,640
(spits) Yee!

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,877
- I got em!

9
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:16,710
- Yee!

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,856
So basically we need three tablespoons.

11
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:19,749
As you guys know, this is how you cut a stick of butter.

12
00:00:19,749 --> 00:00:20,617
(thud) Ow.

13
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:21,589
You cut it and there you go.

14
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,272
Ah, the paper! - Ah no!

15
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:24,105
- Grab the paper,

16
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:24,938
grab the paper. - I don't want to touch it.

17
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:26,762
All right now time to add the marshmallows.

18
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:29,172
- All right, you're only supposed to add at handful.

19
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:30,005
- Handful.

20
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:30,838
- Yup.

21
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:31,671
- Okay, cool.

22
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:32,504
- Wait, no, bro!

23
00:00:32,504 --> 00:00:33,337
What are you doing?

24
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:34,170
Just a handful.

25
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,024
- That's about a handful.

26
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:36,820
- No, this is a handful. - I have big hands, Devan.

27
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,376
- [Collins] This is the bonding ingredient

28
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:39,595
for Rice Krispies,

29
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:42,073
which will be the base of our edible Christmas tree.

30
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:43,984
This smells delicious.

31
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:45,039
Oh! Let's do this, Devan.

32
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,122
It's called the quick pat technique.

33
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:48,098
- [Devan] Whoa, bro.

34
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:49,565
- I've never made this before

35
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:52,179
and this looks just, oh the butter!

36
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,703
Bro, it's getting super gooey!

37
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:55,536
Holy cow!

38
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:57,537
This is melted marshmallows with butter.

39
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:59,348
We're making a Christmas tree, it's gotta be green.

40
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:00,798
But right now, we got some green food coloring

41
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:03,046
and, as you guys know, I'm very good at moderation.

42
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:03,879
Check this out!

43
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:04,712
- No, bro!

44
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:06,638
- Dude, it's bubbling up.

45
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:07,687
It's bubbling up, - I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

46
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:08,520
- It's shootin' everywhere - I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

47
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,353
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:10,885
- It's starting to smell a bit singed.

49
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:12,387
I'm feeling rather spontaneous

50
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:14,030
and so I'm gonna add this entire thing

51
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,295
of food coloring right now. - Wait, what?

52
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:17,144
No! Why? Really? - Yes, yes, yes, yes!

53
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,844
Okay, now you're gonna have to mix it all up, Devan,

54
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:19,677
go for it!

55
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:20,510
- [Devan] All right, I'm going for it.

56
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,878
Go, go, go, go that's so fast, bro!

57
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:24,171
All right, so guys, next up here we got a pan.

58
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,004
And then we also--

59
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:25,837
- Ow.

60
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:26,670
(both laugh)

61
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,503
- I'm sorry we also got Rice Krispies treats.

62
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:29,319
(screams)

63
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,829
- I don't feel safe right now - I'm sorry.

64
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:31,746
- Move it over.

65
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:33,337
(vibrations)

66
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:34,451
(both laugh)

67
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:35,284
Okay.

68
00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:36,117
- Rice Krispies Treats!

69
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:37,192
(laughs)

70
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,025
Yee!

71
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:38,858
- Bro, oh no.

72
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:40,079
Oh no!

73
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,264
Nope, no!

74
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:42,366
- I'll be very careful. - No. No.

75
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:44,753
- I'll be very careful. - Be very slow.

76
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:45,586
- Okay we're good, - Nice.

77
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:46,670
- We're good, were good.

78
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,503
Yeah, so you can just do that.

79
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:48,336
That'd be easiest.

80
00:01:48,336 --> 00:01:49,770
All right, it is time to pour this in.

81
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,011
- Whoa, dude, that's awesome!

82
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,121
Call me the scooper diver!

83
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:54,425
(bubble sfx) - The what?

84
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:55,690
- [Collins] These are starting to come together

85
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,523
really nicely.

86
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:57,525
I get so excited about these little

87
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:58,798
DIY creations we do, man.

88
00:01:58,798 --> 00:01:59,631
These are cool.

89
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:00,464
- Wait, bro.

90
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:02,099
I just realized I been sitting here doing nothing.

91
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,227
- Wait you just realized?

92
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:04,336
I've been well aware of this.

93
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:06,217
- I can actually be helping out so here we go.

94
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:07,165
(claps) (bell glissando)

95
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:07,998
Nice.

96
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:08,831
All right, - Okay, great.

97
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:09,746
- I have a spatula and I'm here to help you out

98
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:12,766
- This stuff has turned out really, really cool.

99
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,031
All right, time for a quick pat.

100
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:15,065
(two clunks)

101
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:15,898
Don't!

102
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,172
All right, I think we are good here.

103
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:18,048
Woohoo!

104
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:20,003
To construct our Christmas trees.

105
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:21,223
We got nonstick spray

106
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:23,215
for our hands that way we can mold it and shape it

107
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,509
into the perfect tree.

108
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:26,034
So bro vs. bro.

109
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:27,983
(spray) (screams)

110
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:29,355
So now I guess we kinda just grab in.

111
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:30,546
- Whoa!

112
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:31,612
- Your tree is gonna be huge!

113
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:33,122
- No no no! - Yes I want a big tree Devan!

114
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:34,048
- I need some more.

115
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:35,338
- So Devan is going for that strat.

116
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:38,641
My strat is to make the biggest Christmas tree ever.

117
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:39,605
Stop stealing!

118
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:40,438
(low pitched laugh)

119
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:41,271
Time to shape the tree.

120
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,542
Oh my gosh, I do not have enough.

121
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:43,425
Ugh!

122
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:44,258
- Are you good dude?

123
00:02:44,258 --> 00:02:45,091
- No!

124
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:45,924
Holy cow, I feel like we should've done this

125
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:47,353
when it was like not as like firm.

126
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:48,531
'Cause it's very firm.

127
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:51,180
I feel like my shape is not as good as Devan's is at all.

128
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,150
How is yours so good?

129
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,274
I'm going for a new strategy.

130
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:54,749
I'm just going for pure height.

131
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:56,508
I want this thing to be reaching into the sky

132
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:57,658
like a massive tower!

133
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:59,052
- All right, that looks about good.

134
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:00,468
(can clangs)

135
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:01,301
(high pitched tone)

136
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,266
- Let the decorating begin!

137
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,099
Ow!

138
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,157
Oh no, oh no.

139
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:07,136
Let's see it's gonna get a whole bunch of it.

140
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,969
Perfect!

141
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:09,377
We got stars for days!

142
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:11,252
Whoa, dude, yes!

143
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:12,436
- Bro, I need some though.

144
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:14,309
- We got some gold fairy dust.

145
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:15,618
I think mine looks pretty fantastic.

146
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:16,451
- Tada!

147
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:17,284
- That's it?

148
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,117
- Yeah, dude, that's it.

149
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:19,391
- Do you have anymore finishing touches?

150
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,224
Because mine,

151
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:21,745
I've locked it in, boom, its done.

152
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:22,592
This is it.

153
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:23,709
- I do have one.

154
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,042
- Devan just made a crazy change to his.

155
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:26,914
Here we go the big reveal.

156
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,977
Three, two, wait, wait, wait.

157
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:30,747
First, five seconds subscribe challenge!

158
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:32,622

Here we go!

162
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:39,905
Five, four, three, two, one.

163
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:41,945
Done!

164
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:42,778

comment down below - Comment down below.

166
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:44,444
"Keyper Squad" right now.

167
00:03:44,444 --> 00:03:45,371
And here we go, the big reveal.

168
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,204
You ready?

169
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:47,283
- [Both] Three, two, one.

170
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:48,490
Tada!

171
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,394
- You added a base to your tree?

172
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:51,227
- Yes, I did.

173
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:52,590
I added a tree trunk.

174
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,359
- So comment down below who won this round.

175
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,689
Is it my beautiful super tall tree?

176
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,264
Or Devan's hyper-realistic

177
00:03:58,264 --> 00:03:59,483
actual Christmas tree?

178
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:01,631
For this round you challenged us to some how make

179
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:04,150
hot chocolate into edible slime.

180
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,810
So to kick this off we gotta roast it.

181
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,244
(crickets chirp)

182
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:08,621
Roast it!

183
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,728
- So we're gonna turn it on.

184
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:13,590
- We need two tablespoons of the olive oil.

185
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,505
The next measurement is very exact.

186
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,533
It needs to be...

187
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:17,542
(grunts)

188
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,375
- No!

189
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,691
You ripped some of the marshmallows, dude.

190
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:21,106
- I know, dude, I tore a marshmallow in half.

191
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,867
We have never made slime like this ever before.

192
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:24,700
- Ever.

193
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,533
- Especially edible slime.

194
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:26,497
One, two, three.

195
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:27,748
Marshmallow trick shot!

196
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:29,149
Nope!

197
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:30,473
Spoons out.

198
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:31,306
Time to mix it.

199
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:32,728
- [Both] Whoa!

200
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,565
- [Devan] Bro, this even sounds fluffy.

201
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,493
- [Collins] This is getting melted so quickly,

202
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:38,748
but like it's turning into goopy slime stuff.

203
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:40,835
- This stuff smells incredible.

204
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:43,517
- Now two tablespoons of this stuff.

205
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,962
- Bro it's all coming out!

206
00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:45,925
- I got it in my eyes!

207
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:47,743
There's chocolate literally everywhere.

208
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,245
Now we need two tablespoons of this hot chocolate mix.

209
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:51,078
Boom.

210
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:51,911
There we go.

211
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:52,744
- all right. - Final one.

212
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:53,577
- Spoon? - Spoon!

213
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,465
Probably the most delicious slime I've ever smelled.

214
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:57,283
This is gonna be so delicious!

215
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:59,048
Why have we never done slime like this before?

216
00:04:59,048 --> 00:04:59,989
- I know, seriously. - This is the greatest way

217
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:00,822
of doing it.

218
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,265
- [Devan] Bro, you dropped your spoon.

219
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:03,509
- Then don't cover my spoon!

220
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:04,425
- I got it, I got it, I got it

221
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:05,442
- I can't touch it, it's all hot.

222
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:06,275
I know how we can do this.

223
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:07,631
Candy cane rescue mission.

224
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:08,464
Okay here we go.

225
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:09,713
Oh, oh!

226
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,087
I gotta hook it, I gotta hook it.

227
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:12,922
I broke the candy cane!

228
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,980
Next up we gotta add some cornstarch and some sugar.

229
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,093
Okay, so a little bit of powered sugar.

230
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:18,361
- That's it, that's it, that's it.

231
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:20,857
- Now time to take the melted down marshmallows

232
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:22,106
and hot chocolate powder.

233
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:23,630
- It's not really coming out at all, really.

234
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,113
- All right, we need more, Devan, I believe in you.

235
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:26,424
- I know, I got it, I got it.

236
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:27,364
It's slowly but surely.

237
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:28,197
Slowly but surely.

238
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:29,030
- Whoa!

239
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,863
There's a giant scoop.

240
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,160
Whew! - Whoa!

241
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,662
- I'm feelin' it needed to be heated up more.

242
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:33,495
(Devan laughs)

243
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:34,583
Okay, change of plan, Devan.

244
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,416
Flip it over.

245
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,662
We gotta put it all back inside man!

246
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:37,495
- All right, all right, all right.

247
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:39,054
- Look at this. It's not heated up enough.

248
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:41,538
(Collins and Devan squeal and shout)

249
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:42,371
Whew, man.

250
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:43,204
That got stressful.

251
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:44,602
So guys we gotta reheat it up right now.

252
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:45,754
We made a big mistake.

253
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:46,587
Dude, it's burning,

254
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:47,420
its burning! - No!

255
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,253
- Just dump it out.

256
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:49,086
Oh my gosh.

257
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:49,919
- Is it dumping?

258
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,752
- It's dumping.

259
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:51,585
- It's dumping.

260
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,454
- This went from looking delicious

261
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:54,250
to looking like something else.

262
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,937
All right let's grab this here scoop-a-doop-a-doop, oh!

263
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:58,694
Gonna mix it, mix it, mix it.

264
00:05:58,694 --> 00:05:59,898
- This place smells burnt now.

265
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:00,804
- Holy Cow.

266
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:02,538
It's on the hot plate, Devan.

267
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:03,371
- Oh no.

268
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:04,204
- Get it off.

269
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:05,435
That's gonna set off the fire alarm for sure.

270
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:06,363
Oh man.

271
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:07,855
I don't even know if this is gonna turn out good.

272
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:08,864
Here's what we're gonna do.

273
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:09,846
Got some cups here.

274
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,056
And we're gonna kinda drizzle some of this.

275
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:12,426
- Is it hot? - Oh yeah, yeah.

276
00:06:12,426 --> 00:06:14,342
It might even melt the plastic to be low-key honest.

277
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:15,175
There we go.

278
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,199
- Oh it's hot, it is very--

279
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,684
(cracking plastic) Oh.

280
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:19,993
- Guys this round was a fail so comment who won.

281
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:21,258
Is it mine who actually made it in a cup

282
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:22,547
or Devan's on the spatula?

283
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:23,614
Again, we're gonna eat these at the end.

284
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:25,256
I still hope it will taste good

285
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:27,530
and right now we're on to the next round.

286
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,443
Have you ever wanted to be able to eat an ornament?

287
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:30,305
- Wait, what?

288
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,029
- Like chomp on it?

289
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:32,862
- No.

290
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:35,088
- Well, after this DIY you'll be able to do that

291
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:36,255
because we're making ornaments

292
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:37,324
out of chocolate.

293
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:38,157
Eee, no! - No.

294
00:06:38,157 --> 00:06:39,818
- Let's make some edible ornaments.

295
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:40,651
Woohoo!

296
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,443
We melted down three different colors of chocolate.

297
00:06:43,443 --> 00:06:44,379
And then, basically, we're going to take

298
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,216
these little paint brushes

299
00:06:45,216 --> 00:06:48,732
and then paint and decorate the inside of our ornament.

300
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:49,792
First, we gotta make sure nothing sticks,

301
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:50,625
so we gotta spray it.

302
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,458
- Nice.

303
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,291
All right, that's one.

304
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,124
- Don't spray me!

305
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:53,957
Don't spray me, dude!

306
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:54,947
Oh, geez.

307
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:55,991
I think we did way too much oil.

308
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:57,754
- This isn't even really working at all.

309
00:06:57,754 --> 00:06:59,017
- Yeah, I think that we definitely did

310
00:06:59,017 --> 00:06:59,864
way too much oil.

311
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:00,699
Oh well.

312
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,138
All right, guys, so I got white coated on

313
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,092
the inside of some.

314
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:04,101
I got polka dots on the other.

315
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:07,268
All right, guys, getting a huge glob of chocolate.

316
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,686
So, now I guess it's like paint on the inside, pretty much.

317
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:11,043
You'll be able to freak your family out

318
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,420
because you just put this on the Christmas tree

319
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,876
and then one night you just like pop it off

320
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:15,257
and be like, "Oh, guys, I'm kinda hungry."

321
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:16,140
(chomp sfx)

322
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,656
And your family would freak out.

323
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:18,957
Next step, pop this in the freezer.

324
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:21,168
It'll harden and then we turn it into

325
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:22,001
the actual orb.

326
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:23,335
Like, we attach two separate things.

327
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:24,714
Boom, one thing.

328
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:25,547
It's pretty crazy.

329
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:26,597
It's now come out of the freezer

330
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,031
and it's the moment of truth.

331
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,482
Can we get the chocolate out

332
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,484
without cracking it.

333
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,317
- You go first.

334
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:33,637
- Mine's actually kind of easy, because this one here

335
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:34,470
as you guys can tell,

336
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,554
it's kinda like full of chocolate.

337
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,144
So, this one shouldn't crack.

338
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:38,405
Oh, yeah! - Ohh!

339
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:39,629
- All right, let's see if I can get this one over here.

340
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:40,462
This one's a little bit thinner.

341
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:41,946
I hear it but I don't know if it's cracking or not.

342
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:43,524
Oh!

343
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:44,607
Please come out.

344
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:46,078
Yeah, ohh! - Ohh!

345
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:47,412
- Dude, that like popped out!

346
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:48,932
This green one's the last chance I have.

347
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:50,059
It's looking good.

348
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:50,892
It's looking real good.

349
00:07:50,892 --> 00:07:52,422
(cheers)

350
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:53,255
I think the green ones

351
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,088
turned out the best.

352
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:54,921
- Yeah.

353
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:55,754
- So, here's what's gonna happen.

354
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:56,880
Gonna drop this on here.

355
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,977
Quick slight burn.

356
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,810
Oop, looks good.

357
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,015
Oh, no, no, no!

358
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:00,848
Get it!

359
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,681
There we go, it's done.

360
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,810
And then put it down over here.

361
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,227
Same thing, slight melt.

362
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:05,060
Okay, there we go.

363
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,409
Oh, no! - No, no!

364
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:07,588
We're gonna put them together like this.

365
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,534
(laughs)

366
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:09,479
It's not round.

367
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,347
That's bad.

368
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:12,241
I will be amazed if you get that out

369
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,240
without cracking it.

370
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,040
- I'm going for it.

371
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
- Oh, oh no!

372
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,438
- So close! - Oh my gosh!

373
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:21,271
- Look at that.

374
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:22,904
(both groan)

375
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:24,787
This is my last chance to even get one of them right.

376
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:25,911
- I believe in you, Devan.

377
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:26,790
I believe in you.

378
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,623
You ready?

379
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:30,238
(cheers)

380
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:31,791
It looks like wrapped present with a bow.

381
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,111
- Oh, yeah, that's what I was going for.

382
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,208
- Dude, look at that!

383
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,233
- Three, two, one.

384
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,637
(gasps)

385
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:38,897
(cheers)

386
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:39,730
- That worked.

387
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,563
All right, so now you've gotta put them on top.

388
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,090
Go for it, go for it.

389
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,923
- Not a lot.

390
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:43,756
- Oh, done, there you go.

391
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,589
- Ooo.

392
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:45,729
(claps)

393
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:46,878
- Now the really fun part.

394
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:48,705
Time to decorate it.

395
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:51,646
Oh, that was actually pretty awesome right there.

396
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:52,704
Just a slight mist.

397
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:54,468
- That's a light mist?

398
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,301
- Perfect.

399
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,261
You gotta get some silver on there.

400
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:57,555
- Bro, there's no gold left.

401
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:58,680
- It's golden on the inside.

402
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,895
One final element left.

403
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:00,781
The top of the ornament.

404
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,614
Here you go. - Oh, okay.

405
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:02,789
Oh, I got it. - I haven't got it.

406
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:04,344
- Oh, no. I thought I had it, but I didn't have it.

407
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,888
- And those aren't gonna work,

408
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:07,380
so let's just forget that ever happened.

409
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,213
- Oh, I got it!

410
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:09,046
- Hook it, bro.

411
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:10,283
- Tada!

412
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,007
I really think that spray made it worse.

413
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:13,975
- We're actually going to eat these right now.

414
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:15,461
We're gonna be eating the rest of them at the end

415
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:16,294
of the video.

416
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,127
But we just can't wait.

417
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:19,342
All right, here we go, three, two, one,

418
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:20,704
but first, three second like challenge.

419
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:23,313
Can you like this video in three seconds?

420
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,146
Ready, here we go.

421
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:24,979
- Three,

422
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:25,934
Two,

423
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:26,929
One,

424
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:27,762
Done.

425
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:30,045
- All right, here we go.

426
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,217
Ahh!

427
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:32,315
(screams)

428
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:33,542
Are you sure this is edible?

429
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,600
- Oh! - That was disgusting!

430
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,433
Oh my god!

431
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:39,599
For this round, we are making Santa on a sleigh.

432
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:40,692
- Yes we are. - We will be making an edible

433
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:41,525
sleigh.

434
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:42,358
The first thing's first,

435
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:45,158
you gotta crack your candy cane open.

436
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,763
Oh my god, it cracked open.

437
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:47,617
Ahh!

438
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:48,450
Woohoo!

439
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,283
Yee!

440
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:51,280
We're basically going to be hot gluing a chocolate bar

441
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,217
to these two candy canes to create the sleigh.

442
00:09:54,217 --> 00:09:55,050
It'll doesn't look like a sleigh,

443
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,572
all it looks like is little elf boots, now.

444
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:57,405
(Devan laughs)

445
00:09:57,405 --> 00:09:59,230
I think I'm going to remain a basic dude.

446
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,111
And just use these.

447
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:01,944
- Really?

448
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:02,777
- Yup.

449
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:03,610
Oo, it's smokin'.

450
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,443
(screams)

451
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:05,276
Oh, that's really smart.

452
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:06,128
Guys, that looks like an awesome little

453
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:06,961
sled right there.

454
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:08,079
So, again, for this I gotta crack this

455
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:08,912
thing open.

456
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,122
Or, should I say, chop it open.

457
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:10,955
(metallic slashing)

458
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:12,038
- There we go. - Hey, you got it open.

459
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:15,188
- I would definitely not recommend opening it that way.

460
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,021
Yeet!

461
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:16,854
(clang)

462
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:17,687
That was pretty easy.

463
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:18,520
You basically just take the candy

464
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,560
and you arrange it on your sleigh.

465
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,302
Yo, we got even more chocolate.

466
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:22,704
So, I'm gonna put a little dollop of hot glue.

467
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:23,537
Boom.

468
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:25,264
Chocolate will never go anywhere.

469
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:26,965
Santa does deliver a whole lot of sugar.

470
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,140
Hot glue gun on top of a Butterfinger,

471
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,973
another Butterfinger.

472
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:30,697
Bam, boom, four Butterfingers.

473
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,014
- Bro, that is not aerodynamic at all.

474
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:34,686
- Top it all off, a bit of chocolate.

475
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,270
- All right, my sled is finally done.

476
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,425
It's not symmetrical at all,

477
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:39,286
but that's okay.

478
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:41,120
- I wonder what happens if you put hot glue on chocolate.

479
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,029
Let's fine out.

480
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:43,506
It like literally melts it.

481
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:46,159
But, like, you can't eat it because it has glue all over it,

482
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,796
so there's that.

483
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:49,224
The only finishing step we need is,

484
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:50,548
of course, the dude who owns it.

485
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:51,894
I'm sorry Santa, but I gotta put some hot glue

486
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:52,727
on your beard.

487
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:54,117
(Collins cheers)

488
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:54,988
It stays!

489
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,885
Holy cow, I am so proud of myself.

490
00:10:56,885 --> 00:10:58,080
All right, I'm gonna pop a snowman on here

491
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,031
because Santa can't be alone.

492
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:01,152
And then, of course, you've got the reindeer.

493
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:02,891
They have a mandatory 15 minute break every

494
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:03,990
100,000 miles, so.

495
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,581
Chillin' over here with Santa right now.

496
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,302
- This is so far what I have going on with my sleigh.

497
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,475
The bottom of it is actually suspended from the ground.

498
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:12,487
And then I got these candy canes for support.

499
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:14,862
They're like the railings where he holds onto, you know.

500
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:16,098
All right, so I'm dumping all of these out

501
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:19,321
and I'm actually using this as my present carrier.

502
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:21,171
This is the bin where all the presents go.

503
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:22,386
- Well, I think you're making a huge mistake

504
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:23,797
because there's actually another use for this.

505
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:26,473
Santa's gonna be riding around in a jacuzzi.

506
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:28,051
This ain't no one horse open sleigh.

507
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,933
This a jacuzzi, boy.

508
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:31,669
Now we just gotta hot glue this thing like crazy.

509
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:32,504
Boom!

510
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:33,344
There you go.

511
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:35,626
And I only have one finishing touch left.

512
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:36,497
On top.

513
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:37,330
It stays, man.

514
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,215
I am an architectural genius.

515
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:40,363
Oh, it's kinda slippin'.

516
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:42,033
- All right, I have just added some

517
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,252
turbo boosters.

518
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:44,236
(Collins laughs)

519
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,386
Onto the back of mine.

520
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:46,453
Look at those babies!

521
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:47,286
- That's crazy.

522
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:49,236
Yo, Santa's gonna be like, "Let's get them the presents!"

523
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:50,263
(shouts)

524
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:51,656
- That's why it has to be hot glued

525
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:52,705
to his seat.

526
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:53,855
Next up is the finale

527
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:56,073
and we're going to be eating all of these delicious

528
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:57,215
edible Christmas gifts.

529
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,048
But first,

530
00:11:58,048 --> 00:12:00,702
guys comment down below who won this round.

531
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:03,341
Is it my Santa in a hot tub with ornaments.

532
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:06,041
- Or my turbo jet Santa sleigh.

533
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:06,923
- (high pitched) blah, blah, blah, blah.

534
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:08,078
All I want to do right now is eat this

535
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,230
but I gotta be patient and wait until the very end.

536
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,965
But right now we are on to the next round.

537
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,106
For this final round,

538
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:14,725
we are joining forces

539
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:18,232
to make the greatest edible stocking of all time.

540
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:19,259
We've got so much candy.

541
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,349
So many marshmallows,

542
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:21,254
so much butter,

543
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:22,370
whatever this stuff is.

544
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,044
And right now, let's begin.

545
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:25,877
There we go.

546
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:26,888
Now we've got the butter melted,

547
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:28,356
time to add the shmellows.

548
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:29,189
- Yeah!

549
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:30,022
- Whoa! - Whoa!

550
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:30,855
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

551
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:31,688
Be very, very careful.

552
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:32,589
Bag number two!

553
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:34,073
This is so many marshmallows.

554
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:34,906
You gotta give it a quick pat.

555
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:36,194
(vocal percussion)

556
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:37,140
They're starting to get mushy,

557
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,328
but I think it takes a lot longer

558
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:39,404
when you have a lot more because these

559
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:40,942
are not going quickly this time.

560
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:43,780
(clock ticking)

561
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,613
Since this is a stocking,

562
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:45,804
we're gonna make it red.

563
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:47,889
Woo, that's a very deep red.

564
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:50,193
- So, I'm doing four and a half cups of

565
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,029
the Rice Krispie Treats.

566
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:53,708
Actually, I'm not even gonna measure it.

567
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,133
I'm just doin' the whole box.

568
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,895
- Dude, woo hoo!

569
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:57,728
Time to add it.

570
00:12:57,728 --> 00:12:58,561
You ready?

571
00:12:58,561 --> 00:12:59,394
Three,

572
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:00,227
two,

573
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:01,060
one,

574
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,227
- Whoa! - Whoa!

575
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:06,266
- This is absolutely crazy!

576
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:07,998
- Dude, this is so much.

577
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:09,287
- Holy cow.

578
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:10,535
- Gotta tip it more, gotta tip it more.

579
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:11,540
(shouts)

580
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,376
- Time to mix it up.

581
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,618
- Bro.

582
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:16,238
- This was not big enough at all.

583
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:17,071
- It's overflowing.

584
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:19,630
- This is turning out absolutely incredible.

585
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,516
Like, it's the perfect shade of red.

586
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:23,299
I think we got it mixed up enough

587
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:24,472
because this is like

588
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,517
oh my gosh.

589
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:26,782
Ready to go.

590
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:28,976
So now, let's make this stocking.

591
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,711
All right, so I'm just gonna kinda follow your lead on this

592
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:32,011
because I have no idea what's going on.

593
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,295
These kinda look like hot Cheetos.

594
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:34,659
Like little, tiny hot Cheetos.

595
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:35,492
- They do.

596
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:36,707
We're makin' one that's really big

597
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:38,398
so you can put a ton of candy in it.

598
00:13:38,398 --> 00:13:41,393
- This stocking is insanely big, bro.

599
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:44,115
- It's bigger than any stocking I have ever received.

600
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,420
- It is fully stuffed with all the goodies.

601
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,359
- So, I'm gonna start with the top of the stocking.

602
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,066
- These Gummy Bears smell amazing.

603
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:51,244
- All right, so we need a boom, gummy bear.

604
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:52,334
Gummy bear.

605
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:53,414
Gummy bear.

606
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:54,628
Gummy bear.

607
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:57,426
- Bro, I think we need some for the actual stocking, dude.

608
00:13:57,426 --> 00:13:58,259
- Gummy bear.

609
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:59,092
We're gonna line it with some

610
00:13:59,092 --> 00:14:00,056
green gummy bears here at the bottom.

611
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:01,293
Because I have no other ideas.

612
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:02,488
I'm gonna be tasting all of these

613
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:04,369
to make sure that they're up to our quality standards

614
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:05,577
on our massive stocking.

615
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:06,633
Ooo, these are little hearts.

616
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:07,466
They're super sweet.

617
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:08,299
- Yeah?

618
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,132
- That's awesome, I love that.

619
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:11,357
All right, these ones smell a little bit sour.

620
00:14:11,357 --> 00:14:12,559
They're like little Batman.

621
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,800
Well, I think this might be a lime flavor,

622
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
but let's hope it's not.

623
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,960
Eww, it's sour!

624
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,793
- It is?

625
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:20,626
- Oh my god!

626
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,459
Why is it so sour?!

627
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,259
(shouts)

628
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:24,155
- Here, try this one.

629
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,857
- This one seems just as bad.

630
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:26,690
(screams)

631
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,431
Oh, it's worse!

632
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:29,755
If these taste like cherries,

633
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:31,387
I will be super happy.

634
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,907
These are like little gummy balls.

635
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,011
Holy cow, they're strong.

636
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:37,815
Let me see how this thing tastes.

637
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:38,648
(angelic voices singing)

638
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:39,747
It's cherry.

639
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:41,349
Oh my gosh I love this so much.

640
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:43,097
I want all of it.

641
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:43,930
Mine.

642
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,763
- No, I, we need it.

643
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:45,596
- Mm-mm

644
00:14:45,596 --> 00:14:46,429
- Bro, we need it.

645
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:47,262
You're just supposed to taste it,

646
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,095
not take it. - Yeah, but it's mine.

647
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:48,928
- Bro, no. - It's gotta go in my pocket.

648
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,560
- I kinda wish you weren't on my team at this point.

649
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,393
- Where do I go?

650
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:52,296
Oo, green balls.

651
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:53,768
- Whoa, whoa, before you eat it, bro,

652
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,041
you have to promise that you will not steel these,

653
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,603
like you did the last one.

654
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:58,602
You gotta pinky promise me.

655
00:14:58,602 --> 00:14:59,488
- All right, I pinky promise.

656
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:00,321
- You promise?

657
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:01,154
- I promise.

658
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:02,324
I think it's green apple.

659
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:03,774
(claps)

660
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:04,966
Mmm!

661
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:05,799
That was so good!

662
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,632
- I want to try some.

663
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:08,087
Mmm, bro.

664
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:08,920
Bro, what're you doing?

665
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,753
- I'm putting it in my pocket.

666
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:10,678
- No, you can't. - Saving it for later.

667
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:11,913
- We pinky promised.

668
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:13,028
- No, no, no, I crossed my fingers.

669
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:13,861
- What?

670
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:16,937
- Now I got cherry in this pocket.

671
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:18,115
I got green apple in this pocket.

672
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:19,299
What other candy do we have?

673
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,132
- I can't believe you.

674
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:20,965
Oh!

675
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:22,201
I think they're licorice strings.

676
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:23,252
- Let's have a competition.

677
00:15:23,252 --> 00:15:24,969
Whoever can get it all up in their mouth first, wins.

678
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:25,802
- All right.

679
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:27,777
- Three, two, one, go!

680
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:28,715
- Wait, wait.

681
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,109
I wasn't supposed to suck it.

682
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:32,332
(lip smacking)

683
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,877
- No, no, no, without your hands.

684
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:34,710
Without your hands.

685
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,543
- Done!

686
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,606
That was not in the rules, and I won.

687
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:38,517
- You cheater.

688
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:39,409
- (low-pitched voice) A prize.

689
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:41,391
- Oh, I've got little game called "Walrus Boy."

690
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:42,354
Arf, arf.

691
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:44,072
We finally finished the stocking.

692
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:45,826
This thing took forever. - So long.

693
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,467
- But it looks incredible.

694
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:49,521
We're about to eat all the different candy

695
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:50,928
that we made throughout this video

696
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:51,761
right after this.

697
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:52,594
So stick around for that.

698
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:54,019
But, right now the big reveal.

699
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:54,852
- Three,

700
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:55,685
Two,

701
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:56,518
One.

702
00:15:56,518 --> 00:15:57,351
Ta da!

703
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:58,948
- This thing turned out so good.

704
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:00,443
And it looks incredible.

705
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:01,884
Like, if this showed up underneath the Christmas tree,

706
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:03,734
I would lose my mine.

707
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:04,567
So, right now guys,

708
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:06,529
time to eat the DIY edible things we made.

709
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:08,699
Starting off, of course, with the Christmas tree.

710
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,701
This Christmas Tree is gonna taste amazing.

711
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:11,681
And guys, comment down below.

712
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:13,697
What everyday items should we turn into

713
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:15,167
edible foods next.

714
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,616
So, right now, let's eat these Christmas trees, bro.

715
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:18,864
- How do we even do this?

716
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:19,997
- Mine's stuck to my plate.

717
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:21,331
Dude, it's stuck.

718
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:22,256
There we go, okay.

719
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:23,596
I'm gonna kinda dip it in like this.

720
00:16:23,596 --> 00:16:24,536
And then you just got to take a bite

721
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:25,408
like corn on the cob.

722
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:26,241
Three,

723
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,312
Two,

724
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:28,145
One.

725
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:33,286
- That's so good.

726
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:34,597
Tada!

727
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:36,734
- Bro, I completely forgot about this one.

728
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:37,947
- I know, it's supposed to be hot chocolate.

729
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:38,899
It turned into this.

730
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:39,732
So, this one right here, we'll have to be careful.

731
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,911
Because, I don't wanna like, chip a tooth on this thing.

732
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:43,061
- It's actually gotten really hard.

733
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:43,937
- Oh my god!

734
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:44,770
- Cheers.

735
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,603
- No, I don't want to eat this.

736
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,566
- Three, two, one.

737
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:49,816
(crunches)

738
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:58,453
- That was so disgusting, bro.

739
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:00,288
Do not make that one the way we made it

740
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:01,954
because it tastes burnt and gross.

741
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:02,787
(blows raspberry)

742
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:03,620
Oh, man, I dropped Santa.

743
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,641
No, Santa fell out of his hot tub.

744
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:05,600
That's not good,

745
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,639
so how do we eat this thing, man?

746
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:07,472
- I don't know.

747
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:08,305
- I think I'm just gonna kinda like tear it apart.

748
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:09,138
- Whoa.

749
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:11,171
(screams)

750
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,204
- Oh, snap.

751
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:13,258
Let's see how this thing tastes.

752
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:15,233
We're gonna toss this up.

753
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,775
- Ooo. - Oh, that's good.

754
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:18,755
This right here is by far the most elaborate

755
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:20,258
mint dispenser of all times.

756
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:21,091
- Oh, yes.

757
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:21,924
Wait, you got Santa in there.

758
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:22,986
It's an eraser, bro.

759
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:23,945
- Santa, no!

760
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:25,367
I hope he doesn't see that.

761
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:27,120
Devan, where'd you put that stocking at?

762
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,997
I want to eat that next.

763
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:28,830
Where's that?

764
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,663
- Oh, I hid it.

765
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:30,824
Because I'm going to give it to you later.

766
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:31,657
For Christmas.

767
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:32,490
- What?

768
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,901
- There is no way you will find it.

769
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:34,969
- You're kidding me.

770
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:35,802
- Nope.

771
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:36,635
- All right, guys, well I'm sorry.

772
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:37,468
I guess you'll just have to wait til Christmas

773
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:38,546
to see what it looks like.

774
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:39,982
You can check that out on my Snapchat.

775
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:40,815
Boom, right here.

776
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:41,812

777
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:42,645
Boom.

00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,478

two,

785
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:51,405
one.

786

Love you guys, bye.

787
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:53,149
