1
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:04,208
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:23,221
- [Girl] I love watching skaters.

3
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:27,501
Because they're so free, messy, wild.

4
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:35,056
We spend our lives being told that we need to be in control.

5
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,825
We are told to write between the lines,

6
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:40,280
the test only has one answer, and above

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,947
all, be a good girl.

8
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:45,782
Even when we do everything they say,

9
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:48,638
one day we wake up to our parents divorcing

10
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:51,429
and the universe laughing in our face.

11
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:54,239
Control is just an illusion.

12
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,125
The big secret no one ever tells you

13
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,958
is that once you let go of control

14
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,576
that's when the real fun starts.

15
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:06,050
- Yo Collins, did you find her?

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,588
- Not yet.

17
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:09,660
Hey have you guys seen this girl?

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,964
- Yeah, she was definitely here.

19
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:12,797
- Yeah.

20
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:14,825
- I think, like earlier today.

21
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:15,899
- Do you remember when?

22
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:18,316
- Yeah, it was like, earlier.

23
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,620
She was taking like some sick art photos.

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,390
She had mad style man, I remember

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,420
because he was like, dude, she's a dime.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,494
(laughs)

27
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:30,479
- Yeah she was a dime for sure.

28
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,812
- I was like, yeah, if you're into that.

29
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:38,012
- [Collins] Did you talk to her, do you know where she went?

30
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:42,179
- Sorry, but hey, you should come watch me skate some time.

31
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:46,994
- Okay.

32
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:53,205
Did you guys just see that?

33
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,821
He was like, see me skate, but really

34
00:01:57,821 --> 00:01:59,824
he was like, let's touch mouths.

35
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:00,657
- What?

36
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:02,801
- Yes, totally, that was so cute!

37
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:05,239
- Carla, where you been girl?

38
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,446
I hit you up like six times!

39
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:08,077
- Hey, babe, I was gonna text you.

40
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:10,126
- No, it's my bad, she's been helping me out.

41
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:11,879
- I wasn't talking to you boy band.

42
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,405
- Eddie chill.

43
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:16,615
- What, don't make me look bad in front of my guys!

44
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:18,484
- You don't need help with that.

45
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:20,132
- What was that?

46
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:21,885
Why don't you go back to your little webcam!

47
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:23,498
Make another stupid Youtube video.

48
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:25,443
- Oh, yeah, like ollies with Eddie Z.

49
00:02:25,443 --> 00:02:28,107
How many views did that get?

50
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,940
- Ollies with Eddie Z!

51
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,068
- Eddie, don't you dare!

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,363
- What?

53
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:43,017
He knows I'm just messing with him!

54
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:45,931
We're bros, right Collins?

55
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:46,931
- Yeah bros.

56
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:49,918
- Cool, so why don't you and your

57
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:51,433
little sidekick get out of here

58
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,180
so I can spend some time with my girl?

59
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,156
- Yeah he's my sidekick, we're going to a street jam!

60
00:02:57,156 --> 00:02:58,676
- What?

61
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:01,039
Let's get out of her Carla, come on!

62
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,130
- You know if you continue to pretend

63
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,738
to be a jerk, eventually you'll just be a jerk.

64
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:07,738
- Dunch bag!

65
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:10,276
- Whatever!

66
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,223
I'll see you later tonight anyway Carla!

67
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:16,390
Yo ten bucks says I can tre flip over that, first try!

68
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,822
- Ollies with Eddie Z!

69
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:24,313
The only reason why I showed you those

70
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:27,209
videos is so you'd know you have something in common!

71
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,538
Now he thinks I'm talking!

72
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:29,960
- Well what was I supposed to do, knock him out!

73
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,485
Look, I've got a black belt, it wouldn't have been fair.

74
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:34,876
- Wow you're such a tough guy Collins,

75
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:36,675
you and him both, why don't you just grow up!

76
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,258
- Why don't you just chill out!

77
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,041
- Do not tell me to chill out!

78
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:46,687
Jake stop, just, look I know you've

79
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:48,446
never really taken him seriously,

80
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:50,512
but the fact is he's my boyfriend.

81
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:52,369
So the next time you decide to get

82
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,994
into it with him, stop dragging me in the middle!

83
00:03:53,994 --> 00:03:55,550
- No, what is there to take seriously about this guy Carla?

84
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,832
You want to know the facts?

85
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:58,568
The fact is that you can do so much better than him!

86
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:00,030
Look, he is doing nothing with his life!

87
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,580
And you are so driven, you work so hard!

88
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,534
You take care of people, you're beautiful, you're smart!

89
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:08,075
(dramatic music)

90
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:09,992
(beep)

91
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:20,560
- Carla, come on!

92
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,780
(dramatic music)

93
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,380
(ringing)

94
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:31,496
- Who's that?

95
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:34,747
- I don't know, I don't give out this number.

96
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:36,664
- Maybe it's your girl?

97
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,725
- Hello?

98
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:43,505
- Yeah, I knew you were screening my calls!

99
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:45,600
- [Martin] Yeah, this is Martin, that's right!

100
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,028
Next time you wanna act like you're

101
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:48,363
disappearin' how 'bout you tell

102
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:50,052
your homies not to take pictures.

103
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:52,048
'Cause I can see 'em all on the internet,

104
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,097
and I know your phone's working!

105
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:55,960
Listen, we talked about rehearsing today!

106
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,522
Where were you?

107
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,089
Listen Collins, do I have to remind you

108
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,486
that this week is the most important

109
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:03,836
week of your professional life?

110
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,665
You know how hard we've worked to get here!

111
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:08,456
Please do not ruin this for us, okay?

112
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:09,456
I got to go.

113
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:15,822
- What am I doing?

114
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:18,033
- What do you mean?

115
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:18,866
- Why am I risking it all for some

116
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:21,805
random girl that I don't even know?

117
00:05:21,805 --> 00:05:25,972
I've made a lot of sacrifices to get where I'm at.

118
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:27,734
Don't get to be with the girl of

119
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,571
my dreams, whatever, I'll live.

120
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:32,444
- Okay, excuse me, can you pull over right here?

121
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:33,495
Please, thank you!

122
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:34,574
- What are you doing?

123
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:35,671
- I'm gonna walk.

124
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,099
- Oh come on, Carla!

125
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:39,560
- [Collins] We're three miles from home!

126
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,738
- I'll have Eddie get me.

127
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:41,667
- No we're not gonna leave you

128
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,868
on the side of the road, come on, get in.

129
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:43,710
- No.

130
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,543
- Fine!

131
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:45,460
- Sit down!

132
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,394
Just go back to your career or

133
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:51,133
chasing your dream girl, or whatever!

134
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:54,035
I just can't sit here and listen to you guys!

135
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:54,868
I'm fine.

136
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,583
- Text me!

137
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:01,632
(dramatic music)

138
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,948
- [Girl] I used to get so confused and lost trying

139
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:07,865
to figure out who everyone thought I should be.

140
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:10,118
Then I realized that being lost

141
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:13,618
is the only way to find out who you are!

142
00:06:13,618 --> 00:06:15,785
And what you really want.
