1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,191
- Taste the rainbow!

2
00:00:01,191 --> 00:00:02,406
(laughing)

3
00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:03,626
- What is going on?

4
00:00:03,626 --> 00:00:04,459
- Well, you know what happens

5
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:05,292
when you taste the rainbow. - Dude.

6
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:06,381
- Right, Devan? - No.

7
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,314
- This happens.

8
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:08,696
Boom, you get a pot of gold, dude.

9
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:10,020
Check this out!

10
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,458
Bro, this makes no sense.

11
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:12,291
- You know what else happens

12
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,130
when you get a pot of gold, Devan?

13
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,963
- No.

14
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:15,599
- You turn into a Leprechaun, bro.

15
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,302
- Wait, what? - Check it out.

16
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:18,135
Alright, watch it, I guess it doesn't quite make

17
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:19,383
as much sense as I thought it would.

18
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:20,216
So, Yeet! - No, it doesn't.

19
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:22,467
- You challenged us to make an edible candy backpack.

20
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:23,560
- But this isn't candy.

21
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,393
Yeet!

22
00:00:24,393 --> 00:00:25,226
- That was a great Yeet, Devan.

23
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,059
- Thank you.

24
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:26,892
- Yeet.

25
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:27,816
Right, let's have some avocados.

26
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:28,649
Wait, I mean marshmallows.

27
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:29,482
Here we go.

28
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:30,412
We're just going to add all avocado,

29
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:31,665
why do I keep forgetting these are marshmallows?

30
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,370
Alright, we're gonna add all the marshmallows in here.

31
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,387
Just dump them in.

32
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:35,822
Ah, we got one straggler.

33
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:36,655
Alright, now we gotta mix it up.

34
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:38,422
Yo, it's like fully melted, dude!

35
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:40,462
This is so good!

36
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:43,928
D.I.Y is very difficult when you're doing it by yourself.

37
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:46,452
That's what D.I.Y stands for...

38
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:47,961
- Alright it's all done, so, Devan, pick up the bowl.

39
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:48,794
- Okay.

40
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:49,689
Be very careful. - Three, two, one.

41
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:51,140
Oh, that's a lot.

42
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,109
- Oh, it's so smooth!

43
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,289
- I think it's too much!

44
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:54,911
Is it all marshmallow chunks, or is it?

45
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:56,296
- [Devan] All marshmallow at the bottom.

46
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:57,795
- Man, we did not mix this well.

47
00:00:57,795 --> 00:00:58,645
Three, two, one.

48
00:00:58,645 --> 00:00:59,478
Boom.

49
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:02,540
- Well, there it goes. - Nice.

50
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,372
- There it goes, so, yes, spray your hand first.

51
00:01:04,372 --> 00:01:05,427
- And then I'm diving in, bro!

52
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:06,260
- Woo!

53
00:01:07,206 --> 00:01:10,045
Wow, it's a little hot, it's a little hot!

54
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:11,298
- Ow, yeah, okay, ow.

55
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:12,931
- Here we go!

56
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:13,764
- Carefully.

57
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:15,093
- Alright, so now we gotta mold this thing.

58
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:16,878
- We're molding it in opposite directions, bro.

59
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:19,202
- Now that we've shaped it, it's time to decorate it.

60
00:01:19,202 --> 00:01:20,188
- We've got some roll-ups.

61
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:21,143
- [Both] Yeah!

62
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:22,104
Strap is attached.

63
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:22,942
- You gotta have a whole bunch

64
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:24,099
of red vines for the top strapping,

65
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,562
so I twist them together like this.

66
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:26,395
- Alright.

67
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:27,518
- This is now an indestructible...

68
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:29,417
And here we go, the final zipper on it.

69
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:30,676
Here's what we're gonna do.

70
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,621
That is the coolest backpack I have ever seen.

71
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:34,035
Ready, set, go.

72
00:01:34,035 --> 00:01:34,868
But, first,

73
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:36,414
- [Both] We've got merch!

74
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:37,314
Aye!

75
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:38,522
- Yo, we got Keyper's Squad merch.

76
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:40,176

You can literally wear this as a backpack.

89
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:03,781
- Oh, yeah, okay.

90
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:04,614
Whoa.

91
00:02:04,614 --> 00:02:05,447
- High-five.

92
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:06,280
- Alright.

93
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,113
- Gotta prank bro!

94
00:02:07,113 --> 00:02:07,946
- Awesome.

95
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:08,779
- No, no, no, no.

96
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:10,304
For this one you challenged us to make edible glue,

97
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,170
so right now, let's go!

98
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,003
- Look at that.

99
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:13,994
- [Collins] Alright, so now we got the butter.

100
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:14,827
- Yay.

101
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:15,660
- Oh, it's slippery.

102
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,493
- Got it.

103
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:17,326
- So, I just need a bowl for this.

104
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:18,752
So, I'm, oh, snap! - Oh, perfect.

105
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,551
- There we go. - And mine is, where?

106
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:22,646
- Did you hold up your hands? - Okay.

107
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:23,616
- Here we go, you ready?

108
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,632
Three, two, one, boom.

109
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:25,465
Just like that, there you are.

110
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:26,298
There's yours.

111
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,186
Now it's very important that you empty out the entire glue,

112
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:29,366
and you then wash it out,

113
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,199
'cause you want to make sure there's

114
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,517
no glue left inside of you.

115
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,183
What? - My hands are so slippery.

116
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:34,310
They're just slipping all around.

117
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,143
- On the count of three,

118
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,089
we're going to make our glue disappear.

119
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:36,922
- Okay.

120
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:38,358
- Three, two, one, boom, there we go.

121
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,139
- Now time to mix it!

122
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:40,972
- [Collins] What are you doing?

123
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,653
Why are you using your hands? - [Devan] It feels so crazy.

124
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:43,486
- Bro!

125
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:44,319
- Dude!

126
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,152
(mixer whirls)

127
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:45,985
- We had one of those?

128
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:47,831
- Oh, my gosh!

129
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:48,848
- We're going back to the hands.

130
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:49,986
- Oh yeah, this thing's out.

131
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:51,603
Alright, so next up, we've got to add some powdered sugar,

132
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:52,703
I have to be very careful with this.

133
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:54,214
(licks lips)

134
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:56,521
The air just tasted like sugar for a split second.

135
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,888
- I was like what happened?

136
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,023
- We need eight cups total.

137
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:00,203
Man, that is a lot of powdered sugar.

138
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:01,947
I hope you don't spill that, bro.

139
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:03,203
- [Collins] We've got to get some more in here.

140
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:04,052
- Oh, man.

141
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:05,999
- Then we gotta get one more here.

142
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,790
- [Devan] It's actually really chalky

143
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,782
but a little bit smooth.

144
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:10,615
- Dude.

145
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:11,448
You know what, I'm actually gonna

146
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:12,441
take mine to the next level.

147
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:13,820
Bro, I'm gonna make like a rainbow glue.

148
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,830
That way when you're gluing something

149
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,807
you can be like, "Whoa."

150
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:17,102
Next up we got the bag right here.

151
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:18,277
- [Devan] Do I need one? (laughs)

152
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,231
- This is for you.

153
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:20,570
- Oh, thanks, slightly used.

154
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,394
- So, here we go, we're gonna pop this in here like this,

155
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,498
just a very reasonable amount is kinda the goal here.

156
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:25,757
- Got it, it's open.

157
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:26,933
- Bro, you really need a spatula.

158
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,796
- Well yeah, you took my spatula, bro.

159
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:30,213
- Well, you got to find a new one.

160
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,382
Ask and you shall receive.

161
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:32,277
- Cool.

162
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:33,916
- I've become a master

163
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:34,765
I mean the frosting.

164
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:36,167
You're leaking out the side, buddy.

165
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,266
- What, it's fine.

166
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,560
Alright, mine's ready to go.

167
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,654
Oh, no.

168
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:40,504
- It's not even coming out.

169
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:41,600
- It's not big enough.

170
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,571
- You've got to bite through it again, I think.

171
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:43,404
- [Devan] I guess so.

172
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:44,596
- [Collins] I'm gonna add some food coloring here.

173
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:46,952
I think that should be enough.

174
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:48,473
- You're dripping on me, bro! - There we go.

175
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:49,306
There we go.

176
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:50,672
- [Collins] Oh, it's not very precise, is it?

177
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:53,788
- Oh, this is a failure. - [Collins] Whoa!

178
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,392
- Oh, no! I've overflowed.

179
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:57,455
Look at, it's all falling apart!

180
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:59,195
So, this is what it's like to be Collins.

181
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,169
- Excuse me, bro?

182
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,225
Now that I've got all my colors mixed,

183
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:03,216
so now it's time to add them to my glue bottle, so.

184
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:05,211
- We gotta get some bags. - It's about time.

185
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,044
(thump)

186
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:06,877
- [Collins] Alright, here we go.

187
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:07,719
Gonna add the first color in.

188
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,376
- Wait, why is the edge of yours curled?

189
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:10,794
- 'Cause see now, you fold it up like this

190
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,696
and so now I can fully squeeze it from the top

191
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:14,974
and it's legit and I'm going to win this round.

192
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:15,840
Hold the bottle for me, bro.

193
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,673
- [Devan] Alright.

194
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,506
- [Collins] Then we're gonna add the first color,

195
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:18,339
which is blue.

196
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,425
- Does this mean I get half of your win, if you win?

197
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,981
- What?

198
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,215
So, here is the big reveal, dude.

199
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:23,554
This thing turned out so good.

200
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,086
Here we go. - And so did mine.

201
00:04:25,086 --> 00:04:27,381
- [Both] Three, two, one, ta-da!

202
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:28,939
Dude, this looks so good.

203
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,487
So, I'm gonna pop the top on right now.

204
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,320
You know what, I can't even wait bro,

205
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,425
let's eat these things right now, alright, you ready?

206
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:33,258
- Let's do it.

207
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:34,091
- Here we go:

208
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,049
- [Both] Three, two, one.

209
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:36,300
- Wait, first, five second subscribe challenge.

210
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,322
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

211
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:41,160
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

212
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,993
Are you ready?

213
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:45,576
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done!

214
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:47,500
- If you could do that,

215
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,333
comment down below. - Comment down below.

216
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,166
- Keyper Squad right now.

217
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,157
Let's see how this thing tastes.

218
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,900
Alright, so I'm going to dispense it in a circle first,

219
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,986
before I try it so we got

220
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:54,451
all purple right now. - Oh, nice.

221
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:56,032
- [Both] Oh!

222
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:57,034
- [Collins] It's coming out, there we go.

223
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:58,681
We got some red, some yellow, some greens.

224
00:04:58,681 --> 00:04:59,514
- Here we go.

225
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:00,847
Three, two, one.

226
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:02,978
- [Collins] Is it good?

227
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:04,365
- Oh, my.

228
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:05,198
- Got it on your lip.

229
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:06,031
So, here we go, I'm going to give it a shot,

230
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:07,974
here we go: three, two, one.

231
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,559
Dude, that taste so good.

232
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,392
Oh, my God! - [Devan] Yeah?

233
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:11,620
- Comment down below who made cooler glue

234
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,503
and right now we are on to the next round.

235
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:15,335
Yo, this is the greatest treasure chest ever.

236
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:16,168
- What?

237
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:17,218
- Nothing you can't know what's inside of this.

238
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:18,159
This is my very secret box.

239
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:20,621
- Okay, well now I'm super curious as to what's in that box.

240
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,952
- Watch, I need a padlock for this, you can't get into it.

241
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:24,908
So, we're gonna show you how to make a candy padlock.

242
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,741
Let's go.

243
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,574
(laughs)

244
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:29,097
First up, we've got to add some water.

245
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:30,252
(slurping)

246
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:31,599
Next up, got to add the gelatin.

247
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,432
Do you know what we do with this, Devan?

248
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,265
- No clue.

249
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:34,098
- Guess.

250
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:34,931
It's written on my shirt.

251
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:35,764
Yeet!

252
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:36,781
Pack of gelatin is mixed.

253
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:37,614
So, here's what I'm going to do,

254
00:05:37,614 --> 00:05:38,902
I'm going to use a marshmallow to stir it up,

255
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:40,766
so it's gonna pour it in.

256
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:41,984
Nailed it, alright.

257
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:42,872
Get out of there marshmallow.

258
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:44,336
Now it's time to pop these in the fridge.

259
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:45,386
Next up, we've got to get some Airheads

260
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,730
and now you mold it together.

261
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,161
Next up, just got to grab some toothpicks.

262
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:50,388
Look it, our fingers are all sticky!

263
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:53,079
Is this what Spider-Man feels like?

264
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,996
- I'm a little pirate, yar-dee-dar!

265
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:58,211
- You better never go in the ocean, bro,

266
00:05:58,211 --> 00:05:59,726
'cause I bet you the pirate associations

267
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,180
gonna come after you, dude.

268
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,107
Send the Kraken on him.

269
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:03,325
- Jello's are now done and now we've got to

270
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:04,158
grab another toothpick.

271
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:05,445
So, toothpick boy.

272
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:06,364
So, we're gonna pop it around the edge here.

273
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:08,164
- Well, this going to be tough.

274
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:09,078
- I've got to wet my lips first.

275
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:09,911
- Why?

276
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,605
To get more suction, traction, friction, I don't know.

277
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:12,520
(slurps)

278
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,353
Nothing.

279
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:15,791
(pounding)

280
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,624
(thump)

281
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:17,619
Yeah, boy.

282
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:18,452
- That's so close.

283
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:19,285
- You don't know what you're doing.

284
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:20,118
- Yeah.

285
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,045
- So, when you got your toothpick, straight down the middle.

286
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:23,361
Boom, look at that.

287
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:24,319
Last but not least.

288
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,221
We have this little button, here.

289
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:26,197
Here we go, there's like a little dial thing

290
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:27,207
that you use to turn it. - [Devan] Oh, nice.

291
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:28,040
- Final step.

292
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,915
I'm going to pop this here.

293
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:29,748
It's a lock.

294
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:30,581
(thump)

295
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:31,414
Oh, no, I lost my dial.

296
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:32,561
- It's like a rappers chain.

297
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:34,471
- Yo, we should be candy rappers.

298
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:36,056
You know what time it is? - Aye, what!

299
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:37,274
It's candy time.

300
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:38,107
Ey, ey, ey!

301
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:38,940
Whoa!

302
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,691
Lyrics, lot's of lyrics.

303
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,007
We got chains, we got candy, and licorice.

304
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:44,886
- Look at these chains.

305
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:46,633
Ain't nobody got these chains. - Oh snap I broke my jewelry.

306
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:50,515
We're the sweetest candy rappers of all time.

307
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,093
- Locks are made, and now it's the moment of truth.

308
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:53,342
I think mine is not gonna work,

309
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:54,800
'cause it just falls apart really quickly.

310
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,508
So, Devan, yours is the chosen lock.

311
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:58,121
- This is going to be a tough move here.

312
00:06:58,121 --> 00:06:59,390
Oh, it's so close, it's so close.

313
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,223
- [Collins] Move it to the side?

314
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:01,056
- I got it, I got it.

315
00:07:01,056 --> 00:07:01,889
Yeah!

316
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:02,722
- That's awesome.

317
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,555
So, you gotta comment down below,

318
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,164

If you want to know what's inside the mystery chest.

320
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,407
- Hey, what?

321
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:08,240
That was mine.

322
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,075
- Yep, I figured out the code.

323
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:10,487
We'll here's the big reveal of what's in the chest.

324

- Yo, check it out, guys.

327
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,194

00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,279
Dude, this is a magical ruler that literally shrinks people.

333
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,112
- Yeah, sure, bro.

334
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,976
- Dude, watch, it's gonna shrink you right now,

335
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:27,809
here we go.

336
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:28,997
Three, two, one.

337
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:30,192
Yo, dude, it actually worked.

338
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:31,025
Holy cow.

339
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:32,037
- Argh!

340
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:33,580
What is going on?

341
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,449
- Well, you guys challenged us to make a edible ruler

342
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,258
that you could literally eat, and right now, Devan,

343
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:38,828
you're going to have a very hard time making it, bro,

344
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:39,907
'cause you are really small right now.

345
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:42,051
- Yeah, I know, and if you don't fix me,

346
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,639
you're going to be in big trouble.

347
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,879
- Alright guys, well, right now.

348
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,285
- Whoa, yes!

349
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:47,220
I'm back.

350
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,519
And you are not allowed to do that again!

351
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,352
(snaps)

352
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:50,285
- No.

353
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:51,693
I'm gonna use this color here for my ruler,

354
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:53,776
so, we got to open it up.

355
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:57,220
Oh, no, that didn't work.

356
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,053
And a Yeet.

357
00:07:58,053 --> 00:07:59,063
To give this a proper open,

358
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,442
we've got to give it the once around.

359
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:01,458
- The what?

360
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,291
(laughter)

361
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,882
It's time to roll mine out.

362
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:06,829
I have one goal, Devan, you've ruined the magic ruler

363
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,568
and so I got to make another magic ruler.

364
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:09,575
- Oh, no.

365
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:10,408
What?

366
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,703
- Man, this is actually very difficult to roll out.

367
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:12,637
There's got to be an easier way.

368
00:08:12,637 --> 00:08:13,853
You know what? I think I can use a big box, just-

369
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:15,926
(thumps)

370
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,306
It's like helping out so much, bro.

371
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:18,994
- It's like 10% flat.

372
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:20,616
Dude, it's so stuck.

373
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:21,745
- Well, yeah, 'cause the, yeah.

374
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:23,103
Pop this little bit in here, like this.

375
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,710
Then you stick this thing in there, like this.

376
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,543
And then just--

377
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:26,376
(thumps)

378
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:27,789
Low-key, I'm creating art right now, bro.

379
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:28,860
Look at this, look at this, look at this, bro.

380
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,247
And now my ruler is complete.

381
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:31,080
- Okay.

382
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,913
- You know what this thing rules?

383
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:32,746
- The world.

384
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:33,859
- No, it's a face ruler.

385
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:35,166
It's to measure your face shape, so what am I?

386
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,685
- You're a square.

387
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:38,347
- [Collins] This represents my head, apparently.

388
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:39,997
- This is the part that could mess it all up.

389
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:40,830
- [Collins] Oops, sorry, sorry.

390
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,866
- Alright, it's finally cut out,

391
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:43,082
now you just peel

392
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:44,182
this part back. - [Collins] The big reveal.

393
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:45,015
Yo! - [Devan] Oh!

394
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:46,951
That is super satisfying, bro. - Yes, yes.

395
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:48,020
Alright, and done. - Dude.

396
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,853
Well done.

397
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:50,567
So you get to comment down below who won this round

398
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:51,943
and who made a better ruler.

399
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:52,776
For this round,

400
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:53,887
you challenged us to make an edible Post-it note.

401
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:55,749
- Wait, no, no, no, dude you can't eat paper, bro!

402
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:56,582
(spits)

403
00:08:56,582 --> 00:08:57,449
- And you know what, Devan, I now have

404
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:58,991
the power of the Post-it.

405
00:08:58,991 --> 00:08:59,824
So, check this out.

406
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:01,151
If I just rub my finger on it like this,

407
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:02,593
oh, Yeet bam, there we go.

408
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:03,613
It's right on you like that. - What?

409
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:04,446
- Yeet!

410
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,518
- Here we go it's working great!

411
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:06,351
- What are you doing?

412
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:07,184
- And Yeet!

413
00:09:07,184 --> 00:09:08,017
Bam, dude, there's like Yeets everywhere.

414
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,413
Here we go, in three, two, one, Yeet, bam!

415
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:12,009
Now I've got arm of Yeets.

416
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,750
And here we go Devan, for the final one,

417
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,583
you ready?

418
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,416
I got to make the fist of Yeet.

419
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,514
Three, two, one, ah, Yeet.

420
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:18,615
And now they're everywhere.

421
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:19,928
Wait, wait, wait, that backfired.

422
00:09:19,928 --> 00:09:22,202
I thought there was gonna be Yeets everywhere.

423
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:24,828
- So, basically, you're going to trace a Post-it note

424
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:25,683
just like this.

425
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:26,866
Collin, what are you doing?

426
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,326
I have the sense that you're not paying attention.

427
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:29,581
- I'm fully paying attention.

428
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:30,414
- [Devan] What are you making?

429
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:31,247
- Here we go! Look at that.

430
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:32,080
Look at that, look at that, look at that.

431
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,178
Mario Wheels are really gonna get the splice in.

432
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:35,585
- [Devan] Now you're not even using anything to trace?

433
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:36,451
- There we go, bam!

434
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,284
You know how you fix it?

435
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:38,117
You go like this,

436
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:39,319
one, two, three, bam,

437
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:40,959
and just like that and now it's all square.

438
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,599
- The next step it's time to write a super secret message

439
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:43,432
on our Post-its.

440
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:44,525
I'm going to choose yellow.

441
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,509
'Cause there is nothing more secret than yellow.

442
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:47,803
- Oh, yeah, 'cause it's gonna blend right in.

443
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:49,794
Right now, if you can guess what I wrote on my sticky note,

444
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:51,738
you will automatically win, so comment down below

445
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:53,489
what you think I wrote down, Devin what you think it is?

446
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:54,842
- I think you wrote, "Snuggle bunny."

447
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:55,675
(crickets chirping)

448
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:56,700
- [Both] What?

449
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,829
- Snuggle bunny? - Snuggle bunny, yeah!

450
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:58,681
- Why would I write snuggle bunny?

451
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,514
- I don't know.

452
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:00,347
- I wrote, "Yeet!"

453
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:01,884
So, who commented down below, great job.

454
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:02,862
What did you write on yours?

455
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:05,146
- It's a super secret message, you'll never know.

456
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,320
- We'll be eating these at the end of the video,

457
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,821
but right now it's on to the next round.

458
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:08,654
(bell dings)

459
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:09,841
This round you've challenged us to make edible paint,

460
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,106
so, right now, let's do it.

461
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:12,645
So, first we've got to separate some Skittles here.

462
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,630
- No!

463
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,463
What?

464
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,012
- Whoa, what happened to this one, here?

465
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:16,845
Now it's time to actually make the paint.

466
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:18,546
- Whoa, hey, bro, I made a hand print!

467
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:21,627
- [Collins] Gonna add water to the Skittle paint.

468
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:24,310
- That could have been so bad.

469
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,158
- Oh, it's already starting to work, look at it.

470
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,143
- We're gonna have a little picnic competition right here,

471
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:29,976
and you know what?

472
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:32,009
We're gonna battle it out.

473
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:32,842
- What?

474
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:33,675
- This. (snaps)

475
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,507
Boom, a pot of gold!

476
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:36,445
I'm gettin' that pot of gold.

477
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:38,062
- Let the competition begin!

478
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:38,984
- [Devan] Oh, I'm excited for this.

479
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:39,817
- Yep.

480
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:40,987
Dude, this is actually super cool.

481
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,648
Yes, yes, I'm all about this.

482
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:43,740
- Dude, what is that?

483
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,479
It looks like a little face.

484
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,434
- This is coming along nicely, oh dear, oh dear,

485
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:48,406
I messed up, I messed up.

486
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:49,903
- You know what?

487
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:50,794
I'm starting over.

488
00:10:50,794 --> 00:10:51,627
But you know what, Devan?

489
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:52,589
I don't even need to get a new canvas,

490
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:53,422
you know why?

491
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:54,255
- [Devan] Oh.

492
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,088
How does it taste?

493
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,940
- Dude, it tastes so good!

494
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,556
Ah, geez, dude, the after taste.

495
00:10:58,556 --> 00:10:59,611
Don't lick a canvas, ever!

496
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:00,783
But I'm going to use some edible paper,

497
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:02,009
that way I can really eat it, but.

498
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:02,842
- Oh.

499
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:03,765
- Alright, so, I've got my edible paper,

500
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:05,748
and I know exactly what I'm going to paint for this.

501
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,343
I can't tell you, Devan, but it's going to be legit.

502
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:08,176
- An eye!

503
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:09,009
You're paint an eye!

504
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:09,842
(buzzer)

505
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:11,508
A music note? - Nope.

506
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:13,282
- You're painting a leg, with a foot!

507
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:14,115
(buzzer)

508
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:14,948
- What is you, what are you doing?

509
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:16,408
- Bro, it's awesome, trust me.

510
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:19,231
- I think we've filled these up too much, bro.

511
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:21,394
My painting is done, bam, nailed it.

512
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:22,988
Dude, I can not believe you actually painted

513
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:24,409
that masterpiece with Skittles,

514
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,431
it looks like a real painting.

515
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:26,264
Alright, here we go,

516
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:27,588
three, two, one.

517
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,496
- [Both] Ta-da!

518
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:29,794
- That looks so good!

519
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:31,345
- [Devan] Dude, yours actually looks amazing, as well.

520
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:32,178
- Thank you, it is a giraffe.

521
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:33,355
- Oh!

522
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:34,188
I get it.

523
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:36,542
But, wait, does that mean that I won the pot of gold?

524
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,917
Yeah? No?

525
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,157
- How about this, the pot of gold will choose

526
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,756
the rightful winner as we high-five.

527
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:41,589
You ready?

528
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:42,422
- Three, two, one (claps)

529
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:43,255
- [Both] Yeah!

530
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:44,088
- And I'm the, wait-

531
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:44,921
Where where is the pot of gold?

532
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:45,754
- Wait, dude where did it go?

533
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:46,867
- I guess none of us are the rightful winners.

534
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:47,912
You get to comment down below,

535
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:49,817
who made a better Skittles painting,

536
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,375
and right now we're on to the next one.

537
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,589
- Alright, for this one we're making edible globes.

538
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,422
- What?

539
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,255
- Edible globes.

540
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:56,088
- What?

541
00:11:56,088 --> 00:11:56,921
- Can you hear me?

542
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:57,754
- Okay, that was actually really loud,

543
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,764
it, like, started to echo in my earlobe and I was like, woo!

544
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:00,761
It's time to make some batter.

545
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,594
Check this out.

546
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:02,427
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

547
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:03,260
(egg cracks)

548
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,599
- For this one here, this is how you dent it,

549
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,432
you break it on yourself for some whipped cream.

550
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:06,265
There we go.

551
00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:07,098
- Oh, no!

552
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:09,667
- This last one here, it's just a one handed crack.

553
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:10,833
- See, that's the thing about a Yeet shirt,

554
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,497
you get a little bit dirty, and you eat a lot of stuff,

555
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:14,130
and then you wash it and it's back to normal.

556
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,363
So, now we're gonna add some of this oily stuff in,

557
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:17,337
got the cake batter.

558
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,886
Whip it to the sauce, boy!

559
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:19,854
Alright, the batter is mixed,

560
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,479
so now it's time to fill these things up.

561
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,393
We're going to use my measuring cup to hold it in place.

562
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:24,323
- Ooh, yeah!

563
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,156
- [Devan] Yeah!

564
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:26,348
It's working.

565
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:28,592
- [Collins] Oh, no!

566
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:30,208
- I'm gonna scoop up the rest of this, here.

567
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,479
Let's go, like- - [Devan] With your hand?

568
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,082
- We're gonna pop these in the oven, and bake them up,

569
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:34,430
and then we'll be right back.

570
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,473
- Cakes are done, we've removed the tops,

571
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:37,372
so now it's time to pop out the first one.

572
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:38,385
- Wow! That worked!

573
00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:40,200
- [Both] It's so smooth.

574
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,432
- Ah, they're so fluffy, so light.

575
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,380
They smell so good, too!

576
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,297
- Ah, Yeet!

577
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:47,380
- [Collins] There we go. - [Devan] Ooh, yeah!

578
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,176
- [Collins] And then just kinda spread it around.

579
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:50,633
Alright, so here we go, we're gonna pop it on top.

580
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:51,568
- [Devan] Time to add mine!

581
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:53,846
- My base, it's stuck in the bottom of it.

582
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:54,846
This is definitely not as satisfying

583
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:55,693
as I thought it would be.

584
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,145
Frosted, frost my cake.

585
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:59,371
- It is time to roll out the fondant.

586
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:00,547
Bro, this is the best part,

587
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,715
- It's no longer a planet,

588
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,755
it's just a pla- and a -net.

589
00:13:03,755 --> 00:13:04,588
(thumps)

590
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:06,212
- There's somebody over here, me,

591
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:08,655
who is doing it properly, that you might wanna watch.

592
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,872
- Well, there's someone over here, me,

593
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,817
that's doing great jobs, that's me.

594
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:14,558
Just a couple of peas in a planet.

595
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:15,534
Look at that.

596
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:16,692
Oh, yeah!

597
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:17,623
Ha-Ha!

598
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:18,602
He's a clown!

599
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:20,350
This is the planet of all planets, Devan.

600
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,206
You know what it's called?

601
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:22,103
- No clue.

602
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:22,936
- It's called, Yeet!

603
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:23,824
Oh, Yeet!

604
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:25,158
- Well, that wasn't technically wasn't a Yeet,

605
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:26,762
that was more like a downward Yeet.

606
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:27,595
- That was a first ever,

607
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:28,751
deet, with a planet of Yeet.

608
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,708
Yo, that looks absolutely amazing,

609
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,678
are you ready for the big reveal?

610
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,511
- Wait, wait, wait.

611
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,406
- Oh, yeah, three second like challenge.

612
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:34,944
We want to see if you can like this video,

613
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,383
in three seconds.

614
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,216
Are you ready?

615
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,049
Three, two, one, done!

616
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:41,305
Alright, here we go, are you ready?

617
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,231
Three, two, one, ta-da!

618
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:44,933
That looks absolutely amazing.

619
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,112
But you know what the one thing is missing?

620
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:46,945
- What?

621
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:47,866
- It's missing the flag of Collins.

622
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:48,847
- Wait, what?

623
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:49,862
Wait, why is your face on this?

624
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,925
- You know why?

625
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:51,895
Yeet! There we go.

626
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,205
So, yeah, if you could comment down below

627
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:54,386
who made a better cake,

628
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:56,434
is it the Deet planet, I mean, sorry, the Yeet planet.

629
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:57,544
Alright, fine, I'll take that back.

630
00:13:57,544 --> 00:13:59,164
Or Devan's version of Earth?

631
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:01,343
Got the backpack and now let's see how this thing tastes.

632
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:03,593
(groaning)

633
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:05,689
- Wow.

634
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:06,856
It's so sweet.

635
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,732
- It's so crunchy and smooth at the same time.

636
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,411
and right now it's on to the next one.

637
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:16,681
Well, now it's time to eat the edible artwork,

638
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:18,015
so I'm going to take mine.

639
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:19,313
- Wait, how am I going to eat mine?

640
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:21,878
There's a little bit here that is kinda coated really high,

641
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,676
so I should be able to do it without licking the canvas.

642
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:24,693
- [Collins] Oh, there we go.

643
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:25,526
- Oh!

644
00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:26,591
- Let me try this, here you go, are you ready?

645
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:27,424
- Yeah, I'm so ready.

646
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:29,009
- Just take the artwork and I guess just--

647
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:29,842
- Well, can I have some?

648
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:30,856
- Uh-ah, uh-ah, uh-ah.

649
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:32,418
- Oh my, how is it?

650
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:33,350
Are you sure I can't have any?

651
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,829
- Oh, yeah, here you go. - I just want some!

652
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:35,662
(chomping)

653
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:38,763
- Dude, edible artwork, it's the future, I'm all behind it.

654
00:14:38,763 --> 00:14:40,232
Alright, next one, here we go.

655
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:41,489
So, it's time to eat our planets,

656
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:43,212
I'm going to take a giant bite of Yeet.

657
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:45,192
I'm just gonna kinda like ball mine up into this kinda

658
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:47,130
lookin' like a pouch of gold, bro.

659
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,963
Cheers me.

660
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:49,863
- I've already cheers you. I already did.

661
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:50,757
- Okay, here we go, ready?

662
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:51,693
- [Both] Three, two, one.

663
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:52,526
(chomping)

664
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:53,767
- [Both] Whoa!

665
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,600
- Man.

666
00:14:58,003 --> 00:14:58,836
- Yeet!

667
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:00,206
Alright, time to do the next one.

668
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:01,914
Alright, I've got my square ruler and now let's see

669
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:02,747
how these things taste.

670
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:03,580
Ready?

671
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,635
(chomping)

672
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:05,468
Whoa!

673
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:06,724
- I expected it to crunch!

674
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:07,557
- So, I've got to say,

675
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:08,769
these aren't the best for measuring stuff,

676
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:10,263
but, boy, do they taste amazing.

677
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:11,520
Trick shot!

678
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,865
Oh!

679
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:13,800
Now we've got an edible Post-it notes,

680
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,823
and there's only one way to get these Yeet Post-its

681
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:16,750
into my mouth, Devan.

682
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,977
- You lick it and you stick it.

683
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:19,838
- No! Dude, it's stuck to my forehead.

684
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:20,671
- Ah.

685
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,255
- Three, two, one, Yeet!

686
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,088
- Dude, nicely done.

687
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,626
- Throwing it in to that Yeet trick shot, man.

688
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:26,015
Well, this could be great if we're passing notes in class,

689
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:26,989
when you pass someone a note,

690
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,047
they read it and then they eat it.

691
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:29,020
Well, I got to eat the last lock,

692
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,639
so, Devan, you get the honor of eating this

693
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,893
candy lock right now.

694
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:33,776
- Alright, here we go.

695
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:37,189
- Oh, the crunch on it, so satisfying.

696
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:38,022
- Is it good?

697
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,272
- It's so good.

698
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,154
- Here's my question, Devan,

699
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:44,033
how effective do you think it is at actually locking things?

700
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:44,866
- Zero.

701
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:46,139
- But how does it taste?

702
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,604
- Well, that's it and if you want to get our merch
