1
00:00:00,405 --> 00:00:02,138
- [Both] Three, two, one!

2
00:00:02,138 --> 00:00:02,971
(squirting) (beep)

3
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:04,964
- You guys challenged us to do the pancake art challenge.

4
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:06,374
We're kicking off with minions.

5
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:07,465
That's not a minion.

6
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,013
It's like a very long yellow worm.

7
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:12,134
First things first, we're just going to forget I did this.

8
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:13,302
Oh whoa these are kinda like bouncy, bro.

9
00:00:13,302 --> 00:00:14,371
I just shook this thing up.

10
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:15,293
(screams)

11
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:16,975
- Dude, what did you do.

12
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:17,883
(laughs)

13
00:00:17,883 --> 00:00:18,881
- [Devan] Already?

14
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:19,714
- It blasted my thumb, bro.

15
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:21,405
Oh no, this is terrible.

16
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:23,105
We haven't even started yet.

17
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:24,312
Devan's already creating art over here.

18
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:27,179
- [Devan] I know, I got my little overalls, I'm ready.

19
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:28,431
- I'm not good, this is not going to be good.

20
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:31,033
You guys know Devan is like a professional artist.

21
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:31,866
I'm not.

22
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:35,867
My minion, he got very wide in the hips all of a sudden.

23
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:36,943
(laughing)

24
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:38,696
My minion, he's like wearing a dress bro.

25
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:40,511
Like a skirt or he's hula hooping bro.

26
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:43,033
Dude, my minion is swole.

27
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,532
(crashing) (screaming)

28
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:47,282
(dramatic music)

29
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,183
I thought you got like batter all over me.

30
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:52,653
(laughing)

31
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,582
- At least it's not as bad

32
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:54,976
as the first time you did this to me.

33
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:56,869
(tape player squealing)

34
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:58,168
- [Collins] Devan, what just happened bro?

35
00:00:58,168 --> 00:00:59,897
- So I was told to shake up this pancake batter.

36
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:00,880
Oh nothing will happen.

37
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,630
It'll be fine, Devan.

38
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:05,771
- Another one, boom.

39
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:07,306
Winning.

40
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:08,541
Now the last thing I want to do,

41
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,774
my minion's awesome and trendy

42
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:10,836
so he's going to have purple hair.

43
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:11,802
(screams)

44
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:12,635
Got me again.

45
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:13,468
- [Devan] You'd think you would learn.

46
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:14,569
Oh no, what are you doing?

47
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:15,463
- [Collins] Making little hairs bro.

48
00:01:15,463 --> 00:01:17,478
I want to get him so he's got some little ear hairs.

49
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,311
- What?

50
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,246
- [Collins] Boom, full heat, roast 'em.

51
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:23,577
This dude's arms look like a second pair of legs.

52
00:01:23,577 --> 00:01:25,750
- No they look like nice stiletto high heels or something.

53
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,583
(laughs)

54
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,988
- [Collins] Bro my minion looks more like a scary monster

55
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,528
than a character from Despicable Me.

56
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:31,361
- It really does.

57
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,993
- [Collins] Can we just appreciate the attention to detail

58
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:33,975
that Devan's doing?

59
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:35,606
Time to flip my minion, here we go.

60
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:36,753
- Dude it's smoking.

61
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:37,903
- No it's sizzling bro.

62
00:01:37,903 --> 00:01:39,942
We're going to eat all of the pancakes at the end

63
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:41,911
of this video, and also after each round you guys

64
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:45,263
can judge us and let us know who you think won each round.

65
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:46,887
Alright let me see if I can get my stiletto high heels.

66
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:47,833
Oh there we goo, boom.

67
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,833
The flip, three two one.

68
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:52,791
(laughing)

69
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,532
Burnt toast so bad.

70
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,755
His face is like, "I got roasted."

71
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:58,680
Three, two, one.

72
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,406
Oh that one looks so good.

73
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:02,370
- [Devan] He has no eyes, but--

74
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,018
- [Collins] Bro, mine looks like he hits the gym

75
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:07,097
way too much and skips leg day every day.

76
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:07,930
The big reveal.

77
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,048
- [Both] Three, two, one, ta da!

78
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,999
So you guys get to comment after each round

79
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,756
and let us know who you think won,

80
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:17,223
but right now we're on to the next one.

81
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:18,056
Y'all suggest--

82
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,338
(clears throat) Y'all.

83
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:20,538
- We'll just start with the y'all.

84
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:21,371
(beep)

85
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:22,215
- Y'all suggested that we make...

86
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:23,282
Did yours not fire?

87
00:02:23,282 --> 00:02:24,675
- I didn't know we were doing it for real.

88
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:25,508
- Yes. (beep)

89
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:26,826
Y'all suggested the laughing crying--

90
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:27,791
- Whoa.

91
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,970
(gasping)

92
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,803
What?

93
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:30,790
- I got it all over my shirt.

94
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,623
Three, two, one, go.

95
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:32,720
(bell dinging)

96
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,553
I need the black stuff.

97
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,386
Get it to me.

98
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:35,219
- [Devan] Okay have fun.

99
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,637
- This is going to be the laughing crying emoji

100
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:37,470
and it's going to be legendary.

101
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,360
(upbeat music)

102
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,034
Yo this guy's got brows on fleek man.

103
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:43,959
His eyebrows are the biggest part of his entire face

104
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,106
currently at the moment.

105
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:46,590
Yeah, yeah his eyebrows are massive.

106
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,757
Ah, his eyes are too small.

107
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:48,913
Oh well.

108
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:52,007
(upbeat music)

109
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:53,450
Bam, nailed it.

110
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,654
Oh my god dude I'm crushing this bro.

111
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:57,664
- [Devan] Oh my gosh, those teeth though.

112
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,326
- Call me an artist.

113
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:01,764
I really made this way too big.

114
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,292
Way too big.

115
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:06,444
(upbeat music)

116
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:08,340
Ah it splattered all over me, not again.

117
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,257
Oh no, something moved.

118
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:13,100
That was not good.

119
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,528
The pressure's on.

120
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,049
Here we go, three, two, one.

121
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,362
- [Devan] That's kinda weird but.

122
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:19,567
- It turned out pretty good.

123
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,473
I'm using red.

124
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:22,756
And even though it's not exactly what we though it would be

125
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:24,513
that's what life is all about.

126
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:25,346
(laughs)

127
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:26,179
- [Devan] I want to get in on this action.

128
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:27,155
This looks like fun.

129
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,825
- [Collins] Let's go bro.

130
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:29,789
(upbeat music)

131
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:30,892
- [Devan] Going for the long distance shot.

132
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:31,851
- [Collins] Boom.

133
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:32,686
Oh man.

134
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:33,918
- Look at that.

135
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:34,769
Oh no!

136
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,519
- Are you kidding me?

137
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,606
You got it on my face.

138
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:40,333
Here we go, three, two, wait wait wait.

139
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,343
First I've got a challenge.

140
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:43,313
I want to see can you subscribe to this channel,

141
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:44,528
turn on the channel post notifications

142
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:47,929
and give this video a thumbs up in seven seconds.

143
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:48,762
Here we go, you ready?

144
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,929
- [Both] Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, done.

145
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,348
- If you can do that comment down below Keyper Squad

146
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:58,882
right now and let's flip this pancake.

147
00:03:58,882 --> 00:03:59,981
- [Both] Three, two, one.

148
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:01,996
(screaming)

149
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:03,294
- No, no, no!

150
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:06,208
You ruined it, my beautiful pancake.

151
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,118
It's ruined no.

152
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:10,061
- [Devan] Wait you flip it, I'll flip it backwards.

153
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:10,894
- No.

154
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:11,727
- Hold on your elbow's in my face.

155
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:13,177
- Sorry.

156
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:14,595
It's a catastrophe.

157
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:15,428
Flip it.

158
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:16,427
(laughing)

159
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:18,134
It looks so scary.

160
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,476
It's like evil bro.

161
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:23,046
- It's like the laughing, crying, angry face emoji.

162
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,916
- I'm literally crying, like my face is this

163
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,621
because when I laugh my face turns red.

164
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,572
Well we are laughing, we are crying about this emoji.

165
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:31,189
- [Both] Three, two, one.

166
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:33,068
(fanfare music)

167
00:04:33,068 --> 00:04:34,167
- Yeah, this uh--

168
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,000
- I don't know.

169
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,568
(screaming)

170
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,401
- It touched my finger.

171
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:38,234
It's so hot.

172
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,067
I'm going to flip it back on.

173
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,650
Next up, a rainbow.

174
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:43,234
(bell dinging)

175
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:44,607
The dude's literally spreading his oil.

176
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:46,182
I am Picasso.

177
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:49,046
I must make my pancake batter look awesome.

178
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:52,422
(upbeat music)

179
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,051
My (screams) oh it got me again.

180
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:56,329
My hands are just a mess currently.

181
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,661
- Your hands are more like a rainbow than your rainbow.

182
00:04:58,661 --> 00:04:59,494
- Yeah.

183
00:05:00,386 --> 00:05:02,330
(upbeat music)

184
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,560
Alright.

185
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,224
(suspenseful music)

186
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,364
When is enough?

187
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:10,833
(upbeat music)

188
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,647
This is one of those moments where I'm taking a risk.

189
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:13,667
It's a creative risk.

190
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,843
You'll have to wait and find out what it's truly become.

191
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:16,756
(screams)

192
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:19,615
- You left it all over the base of the thing so it dripped.

193
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:20,448
- It's not my fault.

194
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:21,281
- Yes it is.

195
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,318
- It is my fault. It's all your fault.

196
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:23,595
- [Collins] Yeah this did not go according to plan.

197
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:25,612
I tried to turn it into a rainbow mushroom.

198
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:26,624
- A what?

199
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:27,855
- A mushroom that's a rainbow.

200
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:28,688
- What is that?

201
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:30,209
- I thought it was going to be very cool conceptually.

202
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,044
It didn't work.

203
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:33,361
Yes, we disconnected successfully.

204
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,927
And here comes the flip.

205
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,611
(gasping) (laughing)

206
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:38,444
- I need the green.

207
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:40,524
- Oh no, I broke you my rainbow.

208
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:41,495
On a casual flip, no!

209
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:43,498
My rainbow, help!

210
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:44,331
I have an idea.

211
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:45,173
I know how I'm going to win this round.

212
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:46,820
It's a double rainbow!

213
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,802
It's a double rainbow all the way.

214
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:51,642
Victory is mine, I've clearly seized the win on this one.

215
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,726
In the meantime I'm going to work on my pancake flippery.

216
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:57,795
(splatting) (laughing)

217
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:59,215
- No, yeet.

218
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:00,048
(glass smashing)

219
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:00,881
I've fallen.

220
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:02,657
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue Devan.

221
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:03,824
You hear that?

222
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:05,838
- What?

223
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:07,463
- I don't know.

224
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:08,296
- You mean the song?

225
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:09,129
- I cracked my knee.

226
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:09,962
- Alright.

227
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,401
- I don't know if you heard that but it was powerful.

228
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:12,234
- Time to flip.

229
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:13,067
- Yes!

230
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,306
- [Devan] Three, two, one.

231
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:16,223
Oh my gosh!

232
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,133
It looks great but there's no yellow, so yeah.

233
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:24,735
It's my no yellow rainbow versus his--

234
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:25,592
- [Collins] Double rainbow.

235
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:27,650
- [Both] Three, two, one.

236
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,900
- Ta da. - Yeah.

237
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,808
- It's tough on this one.

238
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,248
I don't think either of us really won.

239
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:34,289
- What?

240
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:35,122
(laughing)

241
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:36,676
Clearly definitive leader here.

242
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:37,943
Let's go to the next one.

243
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:38,776
- You're right, you're right.

244
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:39,609
Next up.

245
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:41,005
♫ Spiderman, Spiderman

246
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:44,490
♫ Does whatever a pancake Spiderman

247
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,323
- What? - Let's go.

248
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,322
- [Devan] Alright.

249
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,905
(upbeat music)

250
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:52,732
- The sizzling as it knows my Spiderman

251
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:54,266
is going to be awesome.

252
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:56,849
(upbeat music)

253
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:04,086
Now for the moment of truth.

254
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:05,690
Flipping Mr. Spidey.

255
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,711
- Ooh I can't wait.

256
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:08,472
- I'm going to go for like a slide and

257
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:09,782
(imitates thudding) technique.

258
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:12,750
Three, two, two, here we go, one.

259
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,789
(imitates thudding)

260
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:15,223
(cheering)

261
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:17,741
It looks like Spiderman got mixed with like a basketball.

262
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:18,680
- It does.

263
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,890
- [Collins] He has like a little freckle.

264
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,473
(upbeat music)

265
00:07:23,936 --> 00:07:24,772
- Alright here we go.

266
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:26,880
- And this was suggested by the Instagram Keyper of the Week

267
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,475
so shout out to you and if you want to be featured

268
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:29,469
as the Instagram Keyper of the Week,

269
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:31,732
check the description down below to find out how.

270
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,258
And let's see how this turned out.

271
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:36,132
- [Devan] Three, two, one, whoa!

272
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,614
That actually kinda turned out okay.

273
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:39,447
- [Collins] That looks so good!

274
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:40,804
- [Devan] That turned out better than I expected.

275
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:43,696
Basketball versus face mask.

276
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,024
- It's fine, you can vote for his.

277
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,005
I won't be offended.

278
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:47,968
This is by far the most requested one

279
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,687
and it is a fidget spinner.

280
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:51,644
So right now Devan, back at it again

281
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:54,367
making another fidget spinner, this time out of pancake.

282
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,200
So let's do it.

283
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,106
- Will it spin?

284
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:57,659
- Uh probably not.

285
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,242
(upbeat music)

286
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:05,454
I've really got to get some wins coming here

287
00:08:05,454 --> 00:08:06,988
in this home stretch because--

288
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:07,821
- Ooh.

289
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,896
- Things have not been good so far coming up to this round

290
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,486
but hopefully this last one will be redemption.

291
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:14,931
See Devan has just begun his while mine is being flipped.

292
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:16,018
If that gives you any metaphor

293
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:18,644
for how Devan and I are different, that's how it goes.

294
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:20,695
Mine looks like a weird glob with like hands

295
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:21,803
with eyes on it.

296
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:23,575
It looks like everything except for a fidget spinner.

297
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:25,872
It looks like a flying saucer with eyeballs all over it.

298
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,106
Three, two, one go!

299
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:29,451
(cheering)

300
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:30,284
Yeah it works.

301
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:32,167
Alright now time to see if they actually spin.

302
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,093
Here we go three, two, one.

303
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,090
- Ooh, ooh it's hot.

304
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,923
It's not.

305
00:08:35,923 --> 00:08:36,756
(cheering)

306
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:37,749
Should we eat it now?

307
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,215
- Now it's like a weird ring bro.

308
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,856
(cheering)

309
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,685
For the final freestyle round we have 30 seconds

310
00:08:42,685 --> 00:08:43,962
to create our masterpiece.

311
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:44,795
Begin. - Oh no wait!

312
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:45,628
Really?

313
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:47,288
- [Collins] Oh man I'm going way too big.

314
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:48,595
- [Devan] Why are you bumping me?

315
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,690
Why are you bumping my arm?

316
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,523
- [Collins] I'm going way too big.

317
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:51,356
I had a brilliant idea.

318
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,311
- [Devan] That actually kinda worked right there.

319
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:54,144
Okay alright.

320
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:55,513
- [Collins] Oh that was such a good idea.

321
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:56,478
- [Devan] I need purple.

322
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:59,263
- [Collins] Nope, oh my gosh this is not enough time at all.

323
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:00,917
My masterpiece is not a masterpiece.

324
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:01,750
- [Devan] Take the blue.

325
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,583
- [Collins] I need the blue.

326
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,849
(screaming)

327
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,301
Bro, this is not going to work.

328
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,403
- [Devan] No, it's stuck, it's stuck.

329
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:09,834
- [Collins] It's like running out of time.

330
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:10,667
- I'm done.

331
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:11,889
- Five, four, three--

332
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:12,722
- I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

333
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:13,555
- Two, one.

334
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:14,874
- Is this time for you or for me?

335
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:15,707
- Done!

336
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:16,540
(laughing)

337
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,087
Time to reveal the masterpieces

338
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:19,935
and if you want to be featured in the next video

339
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,699
comment down below, what's your favorite food

340
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:23,734
we should turn into a pancake?

341
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:25,023
But right now, let's flip them

342
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,551
and then reveal what they are.

343
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:28,505
Three, two, one, you first go.

344
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:29,636
- [Devan] Oh wait, what?

345
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,515
It's the Instagram logo.

346
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:32,820
- [Collins] Oh that's cool.

347
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,599
Alright mine in three, two, one.

348
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,779
It's a beautiful beach.

349
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,564
See the like little clouds and the sand?

350
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:40,300
(laughing)

351
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,720
And the ocean?

352
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,290
Which is kind of like the sky as well.

353
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,990
- You did not go for something simple.

354
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,823
- Nope.

355
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:47,383
- That's a complex masterpiece.

356
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:48,737
- Now that we've done them all, you get to choose

357
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:50,039
who won each round.

358
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,379
