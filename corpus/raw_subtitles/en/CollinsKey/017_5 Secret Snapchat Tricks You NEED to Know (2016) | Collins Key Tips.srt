00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:01,030
- What's up?

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,863
It's Collins Key.

3
00:00:01,863 --> 00:00:03,193
Welcome to the Thursday vlog.

4
00:00:03,193 --> 00:00:04,038
For today's video,

5
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,762
I'm going to be doing something informative.

6
00:00:05,762 --> 00:00:06,943
You are going to learn something

7
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:09,287
after you are done watching this video

8
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:10,120
which for the most part,

9
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,086
it doesn't really happen on my channel.

10
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:12,702
This is a super special video.

11
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:13,819
I'm going to be teaching you guys

12
00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:15,984
some of my favorite Snapchat tips,

13
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:17,102
tricks, and hacks

14
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:18,553
'cause you guys know I love Snapchat.

15
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:19,467
I'm always on it.

16
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:20,564
You guys always ask me how I do

17
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:21,824
all these different crazy things.

18
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:22,974
Today, I thought I'd let you guys know

19
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:23,807
how it all works.

20
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:24,739
Also, I wanna let you guys know

21
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,549
I'm doing a huge giveaway on my channel right now.

22
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:27,777
I'm giving away a GoPro,

23
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,783
Instax camera,

24
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:29,902
and also a Mac.

25
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:30,906
If you guys wanna win all that stuff,

26
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,884
let me know by liking (bell rings) this video.

27
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:33,886
(bell rings) Comment down below

28
00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:35,049
what is your favorite video

29
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:35,944
that I've ever posted.

30
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:38,008
Of course, you must be subscribed to this channel.

31
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:38,992
Without any further ado,

32
00:00:38,992 --> 00:00:39,825
let's get it in.

33
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:41,237
These are my five favorite tips,

34
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:43,070
tricks, and hacks for Snapchat.

35
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,894
Also, stick around 'til the very end of the video

36
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:46,099
'cause I've got a couple of bonus ones

37
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:47,036
at the very end.

38
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:49,303
Right now, let's jump in to number one.

39
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:50,920
This is hands down one of my favorite ones

40
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,822
to do on Snapchat.

41
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:53,082
This is how you really freak out your friends

42
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:54,464
because people think you only have

43
00:00:54,464 --> 00:00:56,385
four basic filters you can use.

44
00:00:56,385 --> 00:00:57,746
With this one, you're able to create

45
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:00,417
as many filters as you could ever imagine.

46
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:01,798
This is how you do it.

47
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:03,403
For this, select your favorite emoji.

48
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:04,520
I'm going with the flame emoji

49
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,931
because it's lit.

50
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:08,107
(chuckles) Now you just gonna wanna zoom in on the emoji

51
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:09,579
and you'll see a fuzz being created.

52
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:10,476
Using this fuzz,

53
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:12,618
you can now create your own custom filters.

54
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:15,341
Have you ever wanted to write in white or black on Snapchat

55
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,108
but you just couldn't figure out how to do it?

56
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:19,477
Well now you can thanks to this next tip.

57
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:21,447
Also, you can make even more specific colors.

58
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:24,391
(chuckles)Yeah, let's just get into it.

59
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:26,718
To start just tap the icon that looks like a pencil thingy.

60
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:27,949
Go to the color wheel

61
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:30,550
and drag all the way to the top left corner.

62
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,439
That's gonna allow you to write in white.

63
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,841
Now if you wanna do this in black,

64
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,079
just go back to the color wheel,

65
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,656
drag to the bottom left.

66
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:38,607
From there, you'll be able to draw in black.

67
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:40,972
If you want to get in even more specific color,

68
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:41,805
go back to the color wheel,

69
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:42,905
go somewhere in the middle.

70
00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:45,396
Right here, I've got like a pink kind of salmon color.

71
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,759
That is how you do it.

72
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,592
I just wanted to throw this one in

73
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:48,580
as a little bonus, (bell rings)

74
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,102
and that's how you can add people super quick on Snapchat.

75
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:53,150
Pull down and a custom Snap code will appear.

76
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,039
From there, if you hold your phone over it,

77
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,535
tap and hold on that icon,

78
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:58,382
their profile will automatically appear,

79
00:01:58,382 --> 00:01:59,897
and you can add them as a friend.

80
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:00,802
If you want to try this out right now,

81
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:02,712
just go watch this video on a desktop,

82
00:02:02,712 --> 00:02:03,545
pause it.

83
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:04,378
At this point right here,

84
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:06,154
you'll see the little icon right over there.

85
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:06,987
Scan it.

86
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:08,999
That way you can add me immediately on Snapchat.

87
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:10,148
Also, if you haven't already,

88
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:11,408
you might as well add me on Snapchat.

89
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:12,961
My username is CollinsKey.

90
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:14,931
I've always got some fun stuff going on there.

91
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,101
I might even post a little bit of magic

92
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,562
from time to time on Snapchat.

93
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:19,395
Go check it out.

94
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:21,054
Normally, Snapchat restricts the amount of text

95
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,485
you're able to put into a Snapchat

96
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:23,553
which is kind of frustrating.

97
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:24,386
With this one,

98
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:25,754
you're gonna be able to bypass it

99
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,869
and put in as much text as you want.

100
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:28,897
First, take a snap you like,

101
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:29,913
then go into notes,

102
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,782
hit return a whole bunch of times,

103
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:33,089
select it, copy it,

104
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:34,403
then go back into Snapchat,

105
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:35,236
paste it.

106
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:36,301
I know it's a lot of stuff going on,

107
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:39,439
but now you can do literally unlimited text.

108
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,322
This one is for those of you who are

109
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:43,067
very specific and like to get very, very detailed

110
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:46,867
about each letter having a very different color.

111
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,099
Yeah, let's get into it.

112
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,122
We'll start off easy.

113
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:50,618
If you want to change the color of a word,

114
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:52,699
all you have to do is just select that word

115
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:53,633
and using the color wheel,

116
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:54,487
you can change it.

117
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,702
Now if you want to change the color of each letter,

118
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:58,367
again, just select each letter

119
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,471
and using the color wheel, you can change it.

120
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,167
If you do this to all of the different letters,

121
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:04,199
you're gonna be left with a really cool effect.

122
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,597
This one is hands down the sneakiest one of them all.

123
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:08,985
This is how you can screenshot someone's Snapchat

124
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:10,735
without them knowing about it.

125
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:13,206
With great power, comes great responsibility on this one.

126
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,711
First, turn on Airplane Mode

127
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,698
and that's it.

128
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:17,649
Now you just have to go to their Snapchat,

129
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:18,482
screenshot it,

130
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:20,841
and they will have no idea what just happened.

131
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:25,008
(funky music) (audience cheers and applauds)

132
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,074
To use multiple filters at once,

133
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,008
just find the one you like,

134
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,196
tap and hold on it.

135
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:32,941
From there, you can select another filter over it.

136
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:34,411
To turn the camera around super fast,

137
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:35,774
just double-tap on it.

138
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:36,910
If you want to zoom in,

139
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,794
instead of pinching,

140
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:39,126
you can actually use your finger

141
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:40,060
to go up and down.

142
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,332
That will do the same thing.

143
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:42,389
(bell ringing) Snapchat, Snapchat, Snapchat,

144
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,843
