1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,019
- What's up everyone?

2
00:00:01,019 --> 00:00:03,626
It is Collins Key and welcome to the Thursday vlog!

3
00:00:03,626 --> 00:00:06,158
Last week I asked you guys to comment down below

4
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:07,858
what kind of video you wanted to see me do.

5
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:10,444
I got a ridiculous amount of comments asking if I can do

6
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:11,637
the sibling tag.

7
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,662
So without further ado, this is the sibling tag.

8
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:16,617
There's going to be something around over here.

9
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,357
- [Brother] Something? Someone!

10
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:23,201
- The man, the myth, the legend, the expert selfie taker:

11
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:24,771
Devan Key!

12
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:26,250
(snapping)

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,594
Oh, there he is!

14
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,706
- Crazy intro man.

15
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:30,364
- If you guys are excited for the sibling tag,

16
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,134
be sure to give this video a huge thumbs up.

17
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:33,814
Hey no, no, no, I'm not going to be short.

18
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:35,265
Hey, woah this is not cool.

19
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:36,262
- Yeah!

20
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:37,430
(laughs)

21
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,539
- Okay no, I am not doing the video like this.

22
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,574
We looked up the normal questions that you have

23
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,759
for the sibling tag, picked our favorites

24
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,776
and that's what we're going to be doing.

25
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,459
Who is the oldest sibling?

26
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:46,652
I think, if you can't tell, I'm older.

27
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:47,485
- Yeah he's the oldest.

28
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:48,318
- Popped out the womb first.

29
00:00:48,318 --> 00:00:50,062
(laughs)

30
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:50,895
Hey fans, I'm flexing!

31
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:52,383
- [Both] Lean back okay, lean back okay.

32
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:53,938
- Funniest memories of each other.

33
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:54,771
- I peed on someone?

34
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:57,288
- Yeah so Collins was really young and he like.

35
00:00:57,288 --> 00:00:59,247
- No, not really young. I was a baby.

36
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:00,933
I was like a few weeks after being born.

37
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,438
- No, you were like five bro.

38
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:03,708
- What?

39
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:04,579
What the frick, no!

40
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:05,706
(laughs)

41
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:06,539
- You're going to be like, wow.

42
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:08,058
It's like R-Kelly at like five.

43
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:11,057
Apparently babies have like uncontrollable bladders

44
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:12,207
or something like that.

45
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:13,040
I don't know.

46
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,061
My grandma, she was changing like my diaper and stuff,

47
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:17,685
I guess I drank a lot of milk, so I was like yo, bro

48
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:19,879
I gotta let it out and I was like

49
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,712
(laughs)

50
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:23,981
and it hit my grandma smack in the face

51
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,453
and she was just like woah.

52
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,116
- Awww I wish I was there.

53
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:28,164
- But you weren't born yet.

54
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:29,326
On to the next one.

55
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:32,279
All about aggression, Devan will be arrested.

56
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:33,112
- What?

57
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:34,287
That's so lame, I am with it.

58
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:36,501
- Most memorable argument.

59
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:37,943
We don't really argue anymore.

60
00:01:37,943 --> 00:01:39,865
We have however a hardcore argument.

61
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:41,110
- We had that when we were younger.

62
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,403
Now we have like.

63
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,202
- We'll work it out.

64
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:45,376
- Yeah we have like conversations.

65
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:46,209
- To the best!

66
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,535
What up this time.

67
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:48,535
You go dude.

68
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,622
- So we got everything worked out when we were young.

69
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:53,586
- Freeze!

70
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:55,842
Everybody clap your hands.

71
00:01:55,842 --> 00:01:57,061
- Are you competitive?

72
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,086
- [Both] Yes!

73
00:01:58,086 --> 00:02:00,675
- Whenever we play like team games,

74
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:01,628
we can never be on opposite teams.

75
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:03,150
- We'll get too upset at each other

76
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,053
if one of us wins.

77
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:04,887
- It's terrible.

78
00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:06,277
Favorite memories of Devan.

79
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:08,357
- Once I was like, I'm a ninja man,

80
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:10,728
like I'm a freaking ninja

81
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:13,522
and so I was like, bro, I'm going to stand over here

82
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,163
you take the ball, shoot it at me

83
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:17,580
and I'm a dodge and catch it.

84
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:21,246
Then Collins was like no man, I'm not going to do it.

85
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:22,352
I was like yeah dude, you got to do it.

86
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:23,702
- And we were like home alone and everything.

87
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,717
- And I was like bro, I'm a freaking ninja,

88
00:02:25,717 --> 00:02:27,386
and he was like, no way!

89
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:29,472
So I guilt-ed him into it and then he's like

90
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:30,394
standing there.

91
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:33,050
- I was like aiming at him, so I don't hit him.

92
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,883
- Yeah.

93
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:35,073
- I'm going to like, go to the side and then shoot.

94
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,986
Sure enough, which way did he decide to dodge?

95
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:37,819
BAM!

96
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:41,355
- He nicked my finger, because I had to like grab the lever

97
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:42,585
I was just like Oh My God!

98
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:44,111
- I was the freaking one who got in trouble.

99
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:44,944
- I know!

100
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:46,867
- Mom got home and just went ham on me.

101
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,012
- It was the greatest thing.

102
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:49,483
- And he was just like, yeah I don't know why

103
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:50,408
he would shoot an arrow at me.

104
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:51,431
- Literally was the best.

105
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:52,379
- Old photos.

106
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,212
Here's us as children.

107
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:57,444
Here's us as children.

108
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:02,735
- Those are some photos.

109
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:03,662
You should enjoy it.

110
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:04,633
- What's up?

111
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:05,466
- Are we close?

112
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:06,702
- We're very close.

113
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:07,535
Holy crap.

114
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:09,971
We're kind of like the twins that were born together

115
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:11,596
their heads are on the same body.

116
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:12,992
Except we got different bodies.

117
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:13,953
- What?

118
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:14,902
(laughs)

119
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:15,735
What?

120
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:16,869
- I'm just trying to let them know

121
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:18,022
that we're really close bro.

122
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:18,855
- Okay.

123
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:19,688
Oh you mean a conjoined twin?

124
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:20,521
- Yes, that's it.

125
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:21,354
- Okay.

126
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:23,235
- Do you guys hang out and do things together?

127
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:24,576
Yes.

128
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,409
- Quite a lot.

129
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,173
- There's no such thing as my friends.

130
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,517
- You have your own friends.

131
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:29,767
- No, name one.

132
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:33,059
That's right!

133
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:34,205
So yes, we hang out a lot together,

134
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:37,483
because I can't go to anything without this little munchkin.

135
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,316
- Whatever.

136
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:39,602
What do we like to do together?

137
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:40,435
Video games.

138
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:41,268

139
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:42,101

141
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:43,767

- Hiking

147
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:48,765
(laughs)

148
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:50,282
How do you annoy each other?

149
00:03:50,282 --> 00:03:51,599
Like if I slap him.

150
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,682
(laughs)

151
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:00,863
Hey, not the penguin!

152
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:02,135
Get the penguin out of my video.

153
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:04,079
How do I annoy my brother?

154
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,926
Basically I don't let him be in my videos.

155
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:06,779
That's one way to annoy him.

156
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,009
- Which is basically what happens every video.

157
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:10,629
Didn't you know, I have a full youtube page.

158
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:12,637
- Oh yeah you guys, subscribe to Devan.

159
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:13,728

Under the beauty queen 410

161
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,685

00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:17,518
He's got a beauty makeup channel

163
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:18,628
that he will interest you in.

164
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:20,944
Show you how to put on ear liner

165
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:21,777

167
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,856
(laughs)

168
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:25,689
- Beauty guru

169
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,119
- Guru man, you should see him in a push-up bra.

170
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:30,683
- And those are all the questions we have

171
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:31,516
