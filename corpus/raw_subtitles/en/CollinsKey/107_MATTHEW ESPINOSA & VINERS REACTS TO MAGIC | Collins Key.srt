- Watch, watch the King. - I'm watching it.

15
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:23,108
- King goes in the middle, push it in Andrea.

16
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:24,320
- Push it in? - Push it in, push it in.

17
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,447

18
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:27,097

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,858
Goes in the middle about halfway,

21
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:35,034
snap over the cards, go for it, snap.

22
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,181
- K - Your card,

23
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:37,239

24
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,320
(funny mistake sound effect)

25
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,275
- That wasn't there.

26
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:42,406
- That actually gets your card to jump all the way to the

27
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:43,865
shoot, that was the wrong card, right?

28
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:44,968

40
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:01,230
- King of hearts, watch the King, you ready?

41
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,226
Now hold your hand a little bit lower.

42
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:03,314
- No, uh-uh I don't believe this (censored).

43
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,289

00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:05,520
but I can fix it 'cause if I wave it like that

45
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,426

46
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:09,046
