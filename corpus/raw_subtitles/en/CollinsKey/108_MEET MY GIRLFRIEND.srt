1
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:03,094
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:30,268
(laughs)

3
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:32,143
- I'm Leonie.

4
00:00:32,143 --> 00:00:33,310
- I'm Collins.

5
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,229
- I thought you'd given up.

6
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:37,987
- Yeah, after the art show, I thought

7
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:39,647
you were messing with me, or maybe this

8
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:42,509
was some giant, elaborate, prank or something.

9
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,342
(laughs)

10
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:44,175
- That's not it.

11
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:48,133
Actually, I can't believe that I pulled it off!

12
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,967
That you're here, it's crazy!

13
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,161
I wanted to give you something.

14
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:52,994
- What?

15
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:55,428
- An adventure!

16
00:00:55,428 --> 00:00:57,309
(uplifting music)

17
00:00:57,309 --> 00:00:59,201
I used to be like you, but I was

18
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:01,993
always so determined not to be normal.

19
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:03,160
Not to fit in.

20
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:07,153
I spent half my life chasing this, like,

21
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:09,973
need to keep trying new things.

22
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:11,890
To collect experiences!

23
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:16,839
I spent a year in Rome studying architecture.

24
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:19,469
Worked as a sous-chef on food truck.

25
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,886
Modeled in New York, and of course magic.

26
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:26,439
Which is how I found you!

27
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,772
But art, photography, that's what stuck.

28
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:33,201
It made me realize the only thing

29
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:36,875
you have, is the moment you're in right now.

30
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,686
A picture isn't real, it's what's

31
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:42,174
left over from something real that happened.

32
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:43,967
And people see what they want

33
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,912
when they look at it, it's an illusion.

34
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:47,496
Just like magic.

35
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:48,941
- You know, for me, magic is real.

36
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,083
Because, growing up I was always a bit of a loner.

37
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,476
Magic was that one thing that I could do.

38
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:54,683
And I could connect with these people,

39
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:56,285
and it was like it was just me and them.

40
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:58,537
And there was nothing else in the entire world mattered.

41
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:00,928
I was able to make people feel something.

42
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:01,870
- The first time I saw you do

43
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,537
magic on TV, you were so honest.

44
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:07,755
And you cried.

45
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:09,672
No, no, it was amazing!

46
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,686
I don't think I've ever seen someone

47
00:02:12,686 --> 00:02:14,334
want something so badly.

48
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,917
I'd always imagine.

49
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:18,258
- What?

50
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:20,399
- What it would be like to be that

51
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:23,149
one thing that you want so badly.

52
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:25,428
- Why now?

53
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:28,485
- Because I'm leaving LA.

54
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:29,568
- Wait, what?

55
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:32,959
- I left you all of those messages,

56
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,571
so you could know me, even just

57
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:38,583
a little bit, before I asked you.

58
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,539
- Before you asked me what?

59
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,710
- To come with me!

60
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,430
This week is just the beginning of our adventure!

61
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,839
We can go anywhere, do whatever we

62
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,506
want, and just see what happens!

63
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:53,984
- I can't.

64
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:57,725
- Collins, this is what I've been trying

65
00:02:57,725 --> 00:03:00,673
to tell you, you can do whatever you want!

66
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:02,397
- No I can't just leave it all behind!

67
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:06,698
- Yes, you can, because none of that matters!

68
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:09,582
The only thing that matters is right here, right now!

69
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:11,840
- Yeah, but that does matter!

70
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,007
It's my life, magic, my fans, my friends, Jacob and...

71
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:20,264
(soft music)

72
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:35,442
- Oh.

73
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
- I just, I.

74
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:51,595
I should probably get going.

75
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:54,928
- Yeah, get back to your life, I get it.

76
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:57,765
- What about you, where are you gonna go?

77
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:58,891
- Oh, probably some other city,

78
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:01,694
to leave clues for some other guy.

79
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:02,527
(laughing)

80
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:04,654
I'm just kidding, I don't know.

81
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:08,071
I'm not sure yet, but I like it that way.

82
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:15,764
- Thank you.

83
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,181
- You're welcome.

84
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,735
(ringing)

85
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:38,054
(laughs)

86
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:39,195
- There he is!

87
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,181
(laughs)

88
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,412
- Yeah, hey Martin.

89
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:43,722
- My star clown, my magical clown!

90
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:47,402
I was just at the studio man, they love it man!

91
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:49,648
They cannot get enough of you!

92
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:50,812
- [Collins] I don't want to do the show.

93
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:51,645
- Wait, what you talking?

94
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:54,340
- It's just not what I want.

95
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,313
- What do you mean it's not what you want?

96
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:59,300
You don't know what you want, you're like 12.

97
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,256
- [Martin] Hello?

98
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:03,229
Are you serious?

99
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,704
No!

100
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,787
(grunts)

101
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,602
- Hey, Jacob!

102
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,459
(uplifting music)
