32
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,710
if we draw it the player console then

33
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,480
decides how many points is worth based

34
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,010
on how daring of iterative if the player

35
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,510
passes another player can take the steel

36
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,160
