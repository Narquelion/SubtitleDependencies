88
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,859
that commercial outside of the show and

when I'm here in this one

91
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,160
and that's pretty much the whole story

92
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,230
of how I almost got a commercial but I

93
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,860

94
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,860
you see kids
