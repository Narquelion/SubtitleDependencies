growing up in the viridian was normal we

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,120
were in the deepest part of the forest

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,670
so there weren't many other pokemon

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,850
around

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:01:03,810
was quiet peaceful nothing really ever

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:09,410

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,460
of us dies to heal us there we go all

ball for weeks months even years nothing

47
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,180
to do nothing to see no one to talk to

48
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,460
start to forget yourself

49
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,920

50
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,600
from how much rather fight every day for

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,850

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,790
