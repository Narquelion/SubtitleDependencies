15
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,760
if we've been looking at this the wrong

16
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,829
way

17
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,570
what if there's a deeper meaning by wait

18
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,739
a second hold that thought well what

19
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,210
have we been looking at this the wrong

20
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,199
way what if there's a deeper meaning

21
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,780
behind all of this

22
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:48,399
behind what hi Miley behind why she's

23
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:55,690
different why she's changing why she's

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:57,730
been twerking so much I got it what is

25
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,379
Miley really isn't changing what if

26
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,420
she's purposely trying to ruin her image

27
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:03,340
so that she can intentionally lose fans

28
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,809
because some secret organisation is

29
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,230
trying to use her popularity to take

30
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:09,780
over the world it all makes sense now

31
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,940
[Music]

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,780
what the hell are you talking about how

33
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,060
do you even come up with these

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,740
ridiculous conclusions will it's so

35
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,510
simple how do you not see it seriously

36
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,760
well shut up Sean you don't know what

37
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,040
he's talking about either I don't like

38
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,840
doing no he gets it fine

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,490
prove it then at the same time what are

40
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,320
we talking about we're talking about my

41
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,180
body sizes not teaching about Percy

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,860
ruining our image dollar to lose fast at

43
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,990
some secret organization doesn't use it

44
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,340
to take over the world and the reason

45
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,750
why you can't just come on and say it

46
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,460
publicly is because whoever the person

47
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,460
and/or persons that are targeting her

48
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:46,229
bless you thank you I'm powerful enough

49
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,560
to stop her from saying anything I don't

50
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,119
know what just whatever you guys really

51
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,190
think that's what happened yes don't be

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,100
so naive what I said you're being naive

53
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,630
ie don't become words it's a real word

54
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,220
no but why didn't my knee do something

55
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,810
about this sooner why now isn't it

56
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,550
obvious the secret organization can only

57
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,470
brainwash kids which is why Miley was

58
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,820
brainwashed when she was a kid but once

59
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,350
you became an adult they lost control

60
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,360
and that's why she quit had him on town

61
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,890
on the show when she was 18 so dumb

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,900
you're just making up ridiculous

63
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,900
assumptions basing off with no evidence

64
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,400
whatsoever don't be so naive so Miley

65
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,350
sacrificing her career to save the world

66
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,380
not just that see it be amazed when she

67
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,750
was twerking I think I saw something you

68
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,610
see this it think she can tell us

69
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,080
something tell us what the secret who

70
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,100
this organization is and what they're

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,350
trying to do with that

72
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,880
look the VMAs are huge everyone watches

73
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,860
it but you know what gets more views in

74
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,750
the VMAs the Super Bowl and who

75
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,250
performed in the last Super Bowl Beyonce

76
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,600

77
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,070

78
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,420

name destiny and guess what Miley Cyrus

82
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,950
his real name is destiny destiny hope

83
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,600
Cyrus if Miley is destiny and Beyonce's

84
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,280
originally Destiny's Child Miley is

85
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,750
beyond his mom which means jay-z is

86
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,610
Miley's son-in-law since she's married

87
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,840
to Beyonce and jay-z as we all know is

88
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,840
rumored to be a part of what secret

89
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,459
society that's represe

90
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,280
by a pyramid with an eyeball on you

91
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:08,019
don't mean I do they're all apart with

92
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,879
the infamous one and only Key Club Key

93
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:12,040
Club think about it what shape does a

94
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,360
pyramid with an eyeball on it resemble a

95
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,069
keyhole and a key will represent

96
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,180
something lock something secretive and

97
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,530
the only way to see a secret that's

98
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,480
locked up is with the symbolic one eye

99
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,280
by looking through the keyhole really

100
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,200
you really believe that the reason why

101
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,670
Miley Cyrus has changed because of Key

102
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,410
Club the program for high school

103
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,090
students who do community service

104
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,890
project you really don't get it do you

105
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,810
no I don't get how do you open a keel

106
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,280
with a key and what does that key you my

107
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,540
desk Miley was trying to show us the

108
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,010
whole time what do you do when you have

109
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,690
a key you put into the key go and you

110
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,390
twist it a little bit and jerk it around

111
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,239
until it unlocks you twist and you jerk

112
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,099

113
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,200
we twerk we'll be able to see the truth

114
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,269
you've got to be kidding me what I'm not

115
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,400

[Music]

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,600

124
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,280
found the key behind my greater missive

125
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,650
wait what you discovered the truth

126
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,120
behind wild things working so much so

127
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,560
it's not a cry for help an attempt to

128
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,580
expose Key Club as a brainwashing

129
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,370
organization

130
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,290

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,810
made before MS my entire change in

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:50,080
persona it's just a statement a

133
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,830
statement I'm gonna be Who I am that's

134
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,270
pretty close

135
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,830
even if some people might think I

136
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,170
mentioned it [ __ ] some might even

137
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,640
describe this ratchet at least some

138
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,810
being myself but what about all the

139
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,670
people that say you're a bad influence

140
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,830
for kids well right they're telling kids

141
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,820
to be themselves bad and I don't know

142
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,920

mountain I'm always gonna wanna make it

147
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,340
moving but I just have to keep climbing

148
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,860
the climb because I can almost see it

149
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,570
that dream I'm dreaming between that I

150
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,490
can have the best of both worlds to be a

151
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,470
