1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
hey guys so before we get to the actual

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:08,970
video I have a huge announcement

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,010
I said huge announcement thank you I

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,290
just wanted that you guys know that I am

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:18,000
a genius now in the literal Li eyes

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,320
because I wrote a book well okay I start

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,670
working out again and I know this is

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,689
very sudden news for a lot of you

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,460
especially if you don't follow me on

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,260
Twitter at the real Ryan Higa or my

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,410
Instagram at not Ryan Higa

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,510
or on my facebook at facebook.com/ so

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,700
that but the reason for that is that I

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,989
don't like to promote myself or my own

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,320
products because I think that's very

16
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,820
selfish and conceited and I think

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,270
facebook.com slash Shiva TV that's what

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,590
it was

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,180
make sure you guys like my page share

20
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,530
all my videos and make sure you guys go

21
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,329
check it out right now yeah I wrote a

22
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,550
book it is called how to write good and

23
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,899
this is the cover this is not the actual

24
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,160
book I just print out the cover and put

25
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,010
it on a different book this is

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,420
radiographic pathology for technologists

27
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,829
fifth edition and obviously my book is

28
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,320
gonna be better because my book has

29
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,850
picture this has pictures of brains and

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,230
so I don't know why I'm why am i reading

31
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,300
but yeah I wrote the book taught how to

32
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,339
write good it's very I mean it came from

33
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,720
my mind so it's very different and I

34
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,369
mean I'm gonna be honest it's it's super

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,590
weird I don't think that most people who

36
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,380
casually read books are gonna like it

37
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,970
because it's so different but I say that

38
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,890
you have a big announcement I did that

39
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,750
in fact I say it was huge don't let the

40
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,490
fans know that this is a promo of course

41
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,110
not I'm not an idiot and very important

42
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,549
my book sound interesting to not call

43
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:29,130
book weird or anything else negative

44
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:32,670
towards this book how to write good is

45
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,960
so damn good it is sorry so damn well

46
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,080
can be making those kind of mistakes

47
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,930
anymore published author now

48
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,480
this is the best book ever it is not

49
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,340
weird it is not anything that I have to

50
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,750
say negative about it is exactly like

51
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,340
every other best-selling book out there

52
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,810
right now except for the fact that it

53
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,310
hasn't sold that much yet but other than

54
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,400
that it's the same thing there's a cover

55
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,320
with pictures in it there are words so

56
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,540
many words I have the best words huge

57
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,830
words I'm going off-topic the reason why

58
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:05,940
I bring this up other than the fact that

59
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:08,070
I am promote not promoting my book is

60
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,590
because writing a book is a very

61
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,750
important stage in a youtubers career it

62
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,870
means that I am in one of the final

63
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,450
stages of my youtube career and my

64
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,860
youtube life so yeah what are you guys

65
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,120
doing that means we can get out of here

66
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,160
right yeah it's really cramped back here

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,800
I have to poop so bad no I said one of

68
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,790
the final stages not the end just just

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,470
watch the video there are 10 major

70
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,700
stages in the life of a youtuber you

71
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,260
already know one of the final stages

72
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,430
called write a book but we'll get to

73
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,990
that later also keep in mind some of

74
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,370
these stages may be out of order for

75
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,110
some people but for the most part these

76
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,280
are stages that almost every youtuber

77
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,200
goes through at some point so let's

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,880
start with the first one stage one just

79
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,530
for fun not all but the majority of

80
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,090
youtubers first started creating their

81
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,680
YouTube channels because of an interest

82
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,070
that they had and they want to give it a

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,450
shot

84
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,980
not for fame not for money and they

85
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:57,480
basically started making videos just for

86
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,700
fun Stage two I'm smelling poo cuz cuz

87
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,350

88
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,790

better title than that ya feel like you

90
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,110

know what guys can I just stage - I'm

92
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,600
smelling poop this is the stage where

93
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,010
you first start to discover your

94
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,840
popularity start getting recognized on

95
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,700
the streets you have fans you want pics

96
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,320
and autographs and for you you pretend

97
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,120
like you don't enjoy all this attention

98
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,100
because it happens all the time

99
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,620
deep down let's be real you love it cuz

100
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,480
you feel special stage 3 F everyone

101
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,800
hates Minh more successful you get the

102
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,270
more hate and negativity you will

103
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,950
receive and this is the stage where you

104
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,180
make your first video about haters and

105
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,590
why you can't understand why they're so

106
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,180
hateful because it bothers you a lot

107
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,230
knowing that even though you're so loved

108
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,450
there's a lot of people out there that

109
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,489
hate you Stage four haters don't bother

110
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,069
me no more Stage four is when you get

111
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,659
even more popular the

112
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,099
of your YouTube career and with all that

113
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:44,269
Fame you get more and more haters but

114
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,769
now that you've seen it so much you've

115
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,939
learned that hating on haters doesn't

116
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,469
work this is the part where you put on a

117
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:50,359
cool guy act and pretend that hater

118
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:53,629
comments don't affect you anymore but in

119
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:55,129
reality it still does stage 5 run is

120
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:56,689
died there's always that moment after

121
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,040
your peak of your YouTube career where

122
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:59,299
things start to slow down a little bit

123
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,920
and that's when you begin to freak out

124
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,720
and start questioning yourself you start

125
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,040
doubting your own content and eventually

126
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,569
you start to change your content in

127
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,829
order to try and bring your growth back

128
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,420
to what it used to be it's pretty much

129
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,370
desperation time this is where you start

130
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,230
using the old strategy such as clickbait

131
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,700
thumbnails and titles collabing with

132
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,230
other random youtubers so you can

133
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,820
increase your subs and this is also

134
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,739
where you start doing more of the

135
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,449
popular trendy challenges just anything

136
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:22,070
it takes to get you more viewers and

137
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,360
after a while of doing this you get to a

138
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,740
point where your content is not even

139
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,570
what you started out making you're just

140
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,360
making stuff to get views stage 6

141
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,919
Kumbaya positivity is you're depressed

142
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,570
now because your YouTube fame has been

143
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,220
dying down for a while now however this

144
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,949
is a stage that you magically turn that

145
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,139
all around by watching one inspirational

146
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,880
motivational speaker on Facebook talk

147
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:42,340
about happiness and then you take that

148
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,060
speaker's advice to heart and

149
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,669
over-exaggerated not just to yourself

150
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,070
but to all of your fans as well stage

151
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,539
setting the big dis saggin hope you're a

152
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,949
few months of being overly positive you

153
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:53,690
realize that you are putting up a front

154
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:55,460
and you weren't really as happy as you

155
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,199
were pretending to be or preaching

156
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,699
others to be now you must decide you

157
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,320
keep making youtube videos or do you

158
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,909
quit and go and pursue something else

159
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,500
like acting or making a movie and

160
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:05,120
regardless of what you decide you still

161
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,330
make a video telling all your fans that

162
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,010
you want to quit YouTube stage eh just

163
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,020
kidding Mike you told everyone you were

164
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,820
done with you too but you're back it was

165
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,680
a joke what a surprise after such a long

166
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,150
break from YouTube you feel hyped and

167
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,620
refreshed and ready to start taking

168
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,210
YouTube serious again you also found

169
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,919
that passion again um what first got you

170
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,210
start however this doesn't last very

171
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,410
long because of your long break from

172
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,090
YouTube your growth and your view

173
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,530
perhaps it's time to take drastic

174
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,360
measures maybe you should rebrand

175
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,860
yourself maybe start drama with another

176
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,330
youtuber maybe it's not about what kind

177
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,640
of videos you wanna make but what kind

178
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,700
of videos will get you more views stage

179
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,860
9 write a book yeah I started the whole

180
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:45,080
priming the title thing after the intro

181
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:48,270
so you know stage 9 write a book time

182
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,830
stage 9 write a book time is to write a

183
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,570
book like I mentioned earlier one of the

184
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,830
last stages in a youtubers life is to

185
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,030
write a book this is the point where you

186
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,260
believe that you've gone through so much

187
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,670
that you feel the need to write a book

188
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,590
first you finish writing the book then

189
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,420
you don't promote it at all which makes

190
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,400
the book publishing company very upset

191
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,980
with you and tells you that you need to

192
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,870
promote it or else which you then say I

193
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,520

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,990
video where TZ music begins to play

213
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,060
where you start thanking everybody for

214
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,400
everything that they've done for you for

215
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,810
this incredible ten eleven year journey

216
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,240
whatever it is for you that you've been

217
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,700
on and you just try to show how much you

218
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,410
truly truly appreciate them and even

219
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,120
though you're known to be comedic and

220
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,520
you shouldn't be know taken seriously

221
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,880
this is the one time that you are

222
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,800
genuine with your viewers and you really

223
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,610
really just can't thank them enough for

224
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,310
everything that they've done

225
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,889
and you know it gets a little cheesy but

226
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,289
none of that really matters because it's

227
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:23,009

233
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,810

235
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,170

243
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,530
with no skits and it cares that there's

244
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,850
really poor drawings in there even if

245
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,500
