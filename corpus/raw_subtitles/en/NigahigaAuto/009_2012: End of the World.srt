11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,260
you know like in the movies when

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,460
something bad is about to happen

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,290
it goes dum dum dum uh what hello it's

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,750
2012 the world is gonna end

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,450
oh no it's not yes it is the mine said

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,030
so do you even know a Mayan no do you

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,739
even know what a mine is some type of

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,300
cabbage I'm sick of people saying that

19
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,129
2012 is the end of the world

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,859
specifically the people that say well

21
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,480
the Mayans said so that's all they talk

22
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,859
like this you probably don't even know a

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,500
lion and even if you did they're not

24
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,920
psychics they made a calendar I can do

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,630
that

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,070
my theory is this people they say the

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,000
world is ending are they're depressed

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,439
because they've walked the world

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,150
generally go to I believe everything

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,320
they hear and read on Google or just a

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,150
prick because they want to scare people

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,659
into buying useless things for the end

33
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,810
of the world

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,299

problems will be solved with a simple

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,380

stupid but people really are selling

52
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,790
useless crap to people just because I

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,140
think the world isn't which brings me to

54
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,250
my next point the next time someone

55
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,840
tells you that the world is anything

56
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,250
tell them okay in that case give me your

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
money your cat your dog your waffles

58
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,709
because you won't be needing that stuff

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,150
anyway right my point is that no one

60
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,769
knows what the world is gonna end no one

61
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,030
knows when your world is gonna end so

62
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,500
why worry about it that's why it's

63
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,400
cliche as it sounds you have to live

64
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,959
life to its fullest

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,910
