we've done all the sacrifices the lives

23
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,790
lost the materials it all comes down to

24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,239
this I know that I may have let you all

25
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,649
down in the past

26
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,649
well not this time

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,799
feels like it's been years since the war

28
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:13,060
began there to remember our days and

29
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,570
shifty chefs

30
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,700

so weird when we play this that's what

35
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,149
separates me from the average player

36
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:30,310
what are you doing it down this is the

37
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:32,350
kind of mindset you need if you want to

38
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,200
make it to the top the ROI seriously

39
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,270
