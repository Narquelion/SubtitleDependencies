00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,270
hey guys so if you follow what's going

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,380
on in the YouTube community and I'm not

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,790
just talking about my channel I'm

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,799
talking about like all of you - you've

5
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,480
probably seen some or at least heard of

6
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,460
some YouTube drum and by drama I mean

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,990
like you know youtubers fighting online

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,580
it's all public for everyone to see and

9
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,660
I'm pretty skeptics Oh at first I

10
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,940
thought you know these youtubers were

11
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,050
pairing up and agreeing to have drama so

12
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,580
that you know I would create some

13
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,900
publicity for them and also you will

14
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,010
never know but I think it's real I think

15
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,090
it's a hundred percent real I mean

16
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,070
they're not just like tweeting like

17
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,510
snide little passive-aggressive remarks

18
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,160
they're literally calling each other out

19
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,510
there making dedicated vlogs to like

20
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,340
talk crap about each other I've even

21
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,989
seen some youtubers make raps about each

22
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,070
other like it's some kind of rap battle

23
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,860
I think the whole Drake and meek mills

24
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,969
thing I'm just sitting there thinking I

25
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,520
feel a little left out I want to be a

26
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,870
part of the drama life I cannot be with

27
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,320
someone I know how to roast I've had

28
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:50,070
roast beef like okay uh PewDiePie uh

29
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,420
more like a Buddha pie boop doop I is

30
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:58,489
what I meant roaster que si uh what does

31
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,489
that stand for kilns per square inch

32
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:06,540
hole jenna Marbles

33
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:13,049
more like jenna more bowls of poop de

34
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:15,420
pie that's measured in ksi why don't you

35
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,479
apply some water movement on your bird

36
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,790
butt up with the wat put water first to

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,220
clean it okay as you can see I'm not a

38
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,360
good roaster I'm a great one but as much

39
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,490
as I want to be a part of the whole

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,990
drama scene like I don't want to fight

41
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,400
with anyone I don't like confrontations

42
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,960
I mean the closest thing to ever being a

43
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,640
part of the drama life was literally

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,040
when I made a draw my life back in the

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,390
day when I first started like 2005-2006

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,009
you tubers didn't really fight with each

47
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,060
other we all got along for the most part

48
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,920
we help each other out you know we

49
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,210
supported one another we all collab and

50
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,040
if there was drama you wouldn't

51
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,540
necessarily see people posting about it

52
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,920
so publicly online I guess people are

53
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,840
more open about that stuff these days

54
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,189
but it's obviously completely different

55
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,240
now and I'm missing out which is why I

56
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,740
came up with this idea

57
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,149
you probably already know because of the

58
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,680
title it is the roasts yourself

59
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,030
challenge it's easy to call someone out

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,860
on something or it's easy to make fun of

61
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,270
someone else we as humans naturally do

62
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,460
that we're always judging other people

63
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,770
he's so sure he'll look at all that

64
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,479
girl's dress fat that guys she needs to

65
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,190
take off her makeup and put on some

66
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,899
clothes the idea behind this challenge

67
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,129
is basically to look at yourself as if

68
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,140
you're another person and then do

69
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,650
exactly what the title says roast

70
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,569
yourself

71
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,280
and like I said I I don't know how to do

72
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,690
it exactly I think it's pretty open as

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,670
long as you're roasting yourself making

74
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,080
fun of yourself then I think you've done

75
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,430
it you could blog roast yourself you

76
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,930
know literally do what I'm doing right

77
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,060
now but talk bad about your stuff you'd

78
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,709
create a clone character of yourself and

79
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,209
have that character roasty or you could

80
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,590
even do one of those rap battles with

81
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,209
yourself like we mentioned earlier like

82
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,579
the whole Meek Mill and Drake thing

83
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,200
except it'd be you just roasting you I

84
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,370
mean it is a little bit more work but I

85
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,720
actually think that would be the most

86
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,099
fun way to do it anyway just do it

87
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,780
however you want the only rule in this

88
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,069
challenge is to make one of yourself is

89
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,720
to call yourself up because like I said

90
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,250
so many times before we're always so

91
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,959
quick to judge other people but a lot of

92
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,790
times we don't even realize but we have

93
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,230
just as many flaws as everyone else once

94
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,400
you realize and call yourself out in

95
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,780
these flaws it's a lot harder to make

96
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,910
fun of someone else's flaws so let's

97
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,859
stop the drama stop making fun of people

98
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,829
stop mocking and judging people and just

99
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:03,690
take a long look at ourselves just tear

100
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:07,220
ourselves a new one I'm Ryan Higa

101
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,220
and this is the roast yourself challenge

102
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,540
started the game young looking back in

103
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,459
oh six yeah I wear a hat too if my head

104
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,109
were dipped in piss but I guess I

105
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,880
shouldn't hate on a kid who's relevant

106
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:22,680
good thing you're not anymore you thinks

107
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,120
I'm right you elephant relevant like

108
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,739
television what are you been watching my

109
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:33,419
cell in prison oh you wanna prove me

110
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:35,160
wrong let's test your intelligence but

111
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,739
you can do the math yourself right your

112
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,180
age what you dropped out of college you

113
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,069
couldn't make your this race through

114
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,959
your race couldn't either win a tea seal

115
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:45,150
a button like the [ __ ] I please I saw

116
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,519
you crying mothers they saw a jelly

117
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,890
forgotten hotel they'd never been on

118
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,080
Ellen Duffy

119
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,330
watermelon spelling felon like his felon

120
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,250
is your only talent hunting talent that

121
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,020
in silent Allen will not tell them and

122
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,060
last but not least the best parts about

123
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,500
to happen the song is finally and then

124
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,030
man I'm sick of hearing your rapping

125
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,530
transmit fire but you can skate like a

126
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,380
spare tire you are a pig you should

127
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,120
retire give it a break drink cuz you're

128
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,620
literally unimpressive and your raps are

129
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,970
saying aggressive and your flow is like

130
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,770
a carpet getting worse with no

131
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,000
progressive there's only one thing that

132
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:18,430
could make this rap worse than it could

133
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,430
be by ending with and overused on this

134
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,680
see when you roast yourself no one gets

135
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,580
hurt it's a good challenge I'm just

136
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,460
trying to make the world a better place

137
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,540
so like I said earlier the next time you

138
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,860
feel the need to make fun of someone

139
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,270
take a look at yourself first if you're

140
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,980
gonna go and judge someone for something

141
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,360
then go ahead but just know that you're

142
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,770
not perfect either and you should be

143
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,300
judging yourself as well and just like

144
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,070
any challenge I'm gonna be doing some

145
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,300
call-outs to youtubers who I want to see

146
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,440
Rose themselves as well but it doesn't

147
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,940
mean that you guys can't do it either in

148
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,470
fact I look forward to seeing a bunch of

149
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,000

calling out a bunch of my friends to do

153
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,640
this challenge that I think not only

154
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,840
would be good at it but these are all

155
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,100
people I think that aren't afraid to

156
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,970
make fun of themselves and I think where

157
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,140
this challenge you have to be pretty

158
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,640
confident cuz you have to be comfortable

159
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,690
calling out your flaws so with that

160
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,960
being said I'm calling out the following

161
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,030
