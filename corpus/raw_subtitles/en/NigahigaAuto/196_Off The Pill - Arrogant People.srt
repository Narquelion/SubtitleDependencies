00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,830
never met before and this person

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,150
inspired me to make this video yesterday

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,880
I'm gonna be talking about something I

7
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,440
really don't like arrogant people beep

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,199
people who think they're far more

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,449
important than they really are some

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,390
similar or related words are conceited

12
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,789
ignorant douchey cocky [ __ ] jersey

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,710
shore' ish and not to mention the word

14
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,359
arrogant came from the word era which

15
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,149
originated from Robin who we all know

16
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,219
came from the hood arrogance is still

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,480
used all around the world today this is

18
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,320
not a word of the day I don't know why I

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,399
did that intro because I can anyway you

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,879
guys know the kind of people I'm talking

21
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,739
about right

22
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,030
do you know who I am I was on Disney

23
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,379
Channel that one time on that one show

24
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,670
that aired that one time on TV so I'm

25
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,289
pretty much a big deal

26
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,309
I'm the most irritating thing about them

27
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,750
is that they could be watching this

28
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,160
video right now and not know that we're

29
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,530
talking about it because they think

30
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,030
everybody loves me but in a way I guess

31
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,469
I do understand why people would act

32
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,940
like that because apparently now it's

33
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,739
cool to be an arrogant douche for

34
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,660
example celebrities like like Chris

35
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,100
Brown encourage arrogance in their music

36
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,740
could you imagine what his songs would

37
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,560
be like if they were modest yes yes that

38
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,369
look like a toupee I get what you get in

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,850
10 years in 11 years or imagine the Old

40
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,460
Spice guy

41
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,530
hello ladies look at your man now look

42
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,479
at me now look at your man now look at

43
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,369
me he's a little better

44
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,810
my point is unless you're Chris Brown or

45
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,340
somebody that can back it up there's no

46
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,900
reason you should act that way so this

47
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,000
is a wake up call to all you arrogant

48
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,680
people out there II don't like you

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,090
we don't care about how much money you

50
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,350
make unless you're giving it to us don't

51
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,730
care about how fast you can run a mile

52
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,810
unless you're getting a Taco Bell we

53
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,220
don't care about how big your house is

54
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,300
we don't care how much weight you can

55
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,560
bend we kind of care if you have a

56
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,540
Lamborghini though that's pretty cool

57
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,640
and we don't care who you know what you

58
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:49,950
do when you do it and why we just don't

59
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,950
care hey pop shot on 21 exit out

60
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,630
and that's when I realized making videos

61
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,520
putting them online expecting people to

62
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,770
watch and share my opinion well that's

63
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:08,540
just that's just modest as hell I'm

64
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,540
really good at saying I know modest
