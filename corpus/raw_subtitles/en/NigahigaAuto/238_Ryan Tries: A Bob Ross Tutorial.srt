00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,809
hello I'm Rob boss and thank you for

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,730
joining us today today we're gonna be

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,970
doing a painting tutorial in the style

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,820
of Bob Ross no affiliation not related

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,930
but let's get started shall we so at the

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,699
bottom of your screen you're gonna be

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,500
seeing a bunch of the colors that we're

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,109
gonna be using but while you're looking

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,060
at that we're gonna get started is using

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,340
some of this white paint and we're just

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,790
gonna go ahead and just coat this entire

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,750
painting with a bunch of white just

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,870
continue to paint the entire canvas same

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,809
color it already is see the reason why

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,879
we do this is because when we're

17
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,489
actually painting it's gonna be a lot

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,110
easier to blend the colors I can't

19
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,629
actually tell where I've already painted

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,969
because it's the same color but what you

21
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,000
want to do is just just keep on going

22
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:04,710
keep on stroking up and down up and down

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,860
not left to right I don't think it'll

24
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,600
look skidmark right here know how that

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,000
happened but we'll just paint over the

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,310
house see there's no real mistakes in

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,610
painting you just go ahead and paint

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,540
over it there's no mistakes just I I

29
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,119
like to call them the happy little

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,610
accidents kind of like a lot of you kids

31
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,740
out there we've got a little bit on my

32
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,380
black thing right there whoops that was

33
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,650
a mistake as I say just on painting

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,640
should be a nice relaxing tutorial just

35
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,009
watch them nice smooth wisely oh love it

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,040
issues cut to that really colorful

37
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,210
screen with the bead thing well loosing

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,180
a little bit of Bristol's right here

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,970
know if that's a good sign or not you

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,270
want to just keep sweeping that bad boy

41
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,130
out

42
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,110
something wrong with a little hair and

43
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,540
you're painting but you want to start

44
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,729
with the blank canvas let's just get

45
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,070
that that a little straggler in there

46
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,020
keep that hair on it it's not a really

47
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,140
moving but just like anything else it

48
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,270
takes time takes a lot of time

49
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,550
I probably could be using another brush

50
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,940
or something to get that out maybe even

51
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,310
my hands I can't I can't reach any of

52
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,340
the tweezers or something is anyone ever

53
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,670
- either is or something no okay we'll

54
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,510
just keep at it once I get this last

55
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,790
hair off there you go

56
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,750
there you go thanks for watching

57
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:34,110
I'm Rob boss what I wanted to do first

58
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,120
to get started is to start off with this

59
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,230
bloody coping health got a little bit of

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
that blue color in there but we got

61
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,650
start off with this little bloody red

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,540
just want to get the tips of your brush

63
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,520
pull it down so it's a little bit

64
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,380
lighter okay so now that we have a nice

65
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,300
even layer on both sides of your brush

66
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,520
of this nice bloody red what you're

67
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,590
gonna do next is essentially paint a

68
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,150
bunch of X's because we want you know a

69
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,650
little bit of pink in our sky and

70
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,780
because we have red we painted the

71
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:04,510
canvas white in theory it should be pink

72
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:06,730
so just give it a try shall we it's

73
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,190
pretty pink see which one does create

74
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,350
these little X's this is gonna be in

75
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:15,430
your sky and you just really want to

76
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:18,100
make this X format go with a light touch

77
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,830
a lot of X's a lot of X Factor a lot of

78
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,870
X go and give it to you that's not good

79
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:26,019
don't put that in please don't put that

80
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,610
in and there we go all right so next

81
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,380
thing we want to do is continue our sky

82
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,630
with a little bit of blue OH as you can

83
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,060
see there's a some of this doodoo brown

84
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,739
is starting to go on my thumb I'm sure

85
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,000
we all can relate to that so the next

86
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,430
thing we want to do like I was saying is

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,080
continue building our sky we're gonna go

88
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,459
with a little bit this blue right here I

89
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,019
don't know where to mix this because I

90
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,910
used up all the space with the red but

91
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:49,150
that's okay hopefully gets a little bit

92
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,890
lighter it's not we're just gonna have

93
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,660
to go with this so we're gonna start at

94
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,730
the top and paint the rest of our sky

95
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,730
with more X's little X's like so

96
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:04,440
kind of painting the top handle of this

97
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:07,120
bezel but that's okay

98
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,590
if the X's aren't don't seem to be

99
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,360
blending too well you might want to try

100
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:15,850
some other letters so maybe let's try

101
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:17,729
some wise lowercase wise it's pretty

102
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,350
much just Mac's

103
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:21,699
as you can see you can't tell what one

104
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,780
color starts and where another one

105
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:28,419
begins I can't see it also colorblind if

106
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,889
you want to give the illusion of a happy

107
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,990
little cloud right here you're gonna

108
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:36,639
want to just kind of dab it in and

109
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,500
strokes a car okay that's that's not a

110
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,070
happy cloud it's a little angry but like

111
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,650
I said you know what I said let's just

112
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,479
go and try and make make make this work

113
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,360
a little bit just think really happy

114
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,690
thoughts and just spend it in now you

115
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:58,389
have nice little cloud as you can see

116
00:04:52,690 --> 00:05:00,550
just blending in thanks for watching I'm

117
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,919
not boss let's put some water in there

118
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,160
how you gonna really love water so you

119
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,620
want to start from the bottom and always

120
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,349
go left to right

121
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,090
start from the outside-in might have

122
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:16,900
gotten a little bit of black on the

123
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:20,229
brush another big whoops you want to be

124
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:23,280
very generous with your paint you can

125
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:26,699
have that nice dark look on the outside

126
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,050
just like my soul

127
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:33,159
always remember to pull from the outside

128
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,930
in horizontal strokes only as you know

129
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:37,889
the ocean or Lego is horizontally

130
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:42,940
there's no ocean that goes vertically

131
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:45,820
and there is your ocean what we're gonna

132
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,840
do next is dark in all the corners even

133
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:51,250
the bottom right here some at the top

134
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,680
want to really give it that that one

135
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,470
little filter thing on Instagram

136
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,590
the vinaigrette thing so you want to

137
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,880
keep darkening each corner it's okay if

138
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,360
you're painting shakes a little like

139
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,470
this I'm not sure why it's moving

140
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,110
sometimes your paintings just come to

141
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,240
life and if this one is definitely it's

142
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,500
time to look good and it is coming to

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,530
life but we need another little baby

144
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,110
thing let's go and do that and once you

145
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,750
finish off your corners this is for the

146
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,690
really fun part washing your brushes so

147
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,849
you're gonna want to dip your brush into

148
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,229
this water and paint thinner and you

149
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:27,669
don't want to spill it like I just did

150
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,169
it so you can i really want to rinse it

151
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,340
out as you can see I put a little bit

152
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,670
too much paint

153
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:37,600
and we might need a little bit more

154
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:41,290
water whoops

155
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,010
and now that you have your relatively

156
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:47,370
clean brush what you're gonna do is

157
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:50,100
basically just blend everything in

158
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:53,260
starting from the lighter colors in

159
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,630
which is the pink area just blend it in

160
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,970
and I pretty much do that pink let's

161
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:00,010
move on the next thing we're gonna want

162
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,860
to do is just take a little bit more of

163
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,990
that blue this time we're gonna mix in a

164
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,080
little bit of white oh no just a tad bit

165
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,090
lighter this is the real fun part here

166
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,260
watch here you're just gonna take the

167
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:17,500
corner and just Dad and pull down just

168
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,840
creating that distant little trees in

169
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,600
the back no I may not look like trees

170
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,340
yet but we'll get there

171
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:29,310
then you want to grab a clean brush and

172
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:38,440
you kind of just one on dab it pull up

173
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:42,160
create that illusion of mist I don't

174
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,280
know what's next what we're gonna do is

175
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,020
add another layer of trees but a little

176
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,730
closer so you want to go a little bit

177
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:54,270
darker and we're gonna do the same thing

178
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:54,270
just a little closer and pull down

179
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,260
everybody likes trees that is your

180
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,520
second layer of trees and then we're

181
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,600
just gonna take our clean brush again

182
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,870
and just do the same thing create that

183
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,390
illusion of mist I might have put a

184
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,710
little bit pinkish pain again common

185
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:19,870
mistake you're gonna want to pull up

186
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:27,280
from the water you're gonna do a pull up

187
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:30,640
that works kind of yep next thing we're

188
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,740
gonna do is get our little knife thing

189
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,250
right here and we're gonna just take a

190
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,770
little bit more of that blue black add

191
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,270
some red in there as well like soon why

192
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,010
not add some white while we're at it put

193
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,440
some white in that bad boy it makes this

194
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,620
bad layup totally up to you

195
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,079
what you want to do this painting is

196
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,550
your world you have all the control but

197
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,110
really what you want to do is check Bob

198
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,959
Ross's tutoria to make sure you're doing

199
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:59,560
it right so we're gonna do is give

200
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:01,959
ourselves some trees so what you wanna

201
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,980
do is just kind of dad making little

202
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,230
trees still in the distance might look

203
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,600
like a bunch of sticks for now but they

204
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,439
are trees don't be shy

205
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,079
every tree needs a friend Chandler some

206
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:21,040
Monica

207
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:25,600
Austin Rachael right here Pheebs no

208
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:30,670
choice we don't need no Joey's and those

209
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,750
are some pretty not detailed trees it's

210
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,610
gonna do is we're gonna take a little

211
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,279
bit of white it's nice too little need a

212
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:42,970
little trick I like to call creating

213
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:44,889
that just get some white and you're just

214
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,689
gonna tap it in between the trees to

215
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:52,930
give it a little looser of a having no

216
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:57,220
no trunks in there tree trunks just a

217
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:59,680
bit here and there don't need a lot fact

218
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,420
you can barely see it a bit but I can

219
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,860
cuz I'm really close to it the next

220
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,649
thing you want to do is take your knife

221
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:16,540
just get a little bit of white re a

222
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:20,949
little bit on the edges here we are

223
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:25,269
gonna create a water line do these

224
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:32,589
little slices right here all the way

225
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:36,069
across just like rick ross i next we are

226
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:37,720
going to make another color get a little

227
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:40,449
bit of red in there a little bit of blue

228
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,500
a bit of green really just mix in

229
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:44,199
whatever the hell you want to do

230
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,199
whatever makes you happy so you can see

231
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:48,459
it's just another dark color being as

232
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:50,500
colorblind as i am they all look pretty

233
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:53,250
much the same this dude who is still on

234
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,070
my thumb ain't nothing wrong with that

235
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,600
use your head

236
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:03,550
this parts really scary but remember

237
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:06,910
there are no mistakes they're just happy

238
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:10,500
acts happy just start right here I'm

239
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:13,300
gonna start them in a straight line down

240
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,589
here's my kids are really crazy what you

241
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,810
want to do is take the edge of your

242
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:20,620
brush your fan brush just do a little

243
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:24,040
dab right about here I'm gonna dab on

244
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,980
this side and then back on this side

245
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,490
just a little bit wider and just

246
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,519
continue the pattern you're just gonna

247
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:37,350
because ease just gonna make as ease

248
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:42,880
back and forth back and forth

249
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:48,329
lots of Z's lots of trees I'm sure

250
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,329
there's some bees and here are my knees

251
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:57,190
there's one tree and I'm just gonna make

252
00:11:52,570 --> 00:12:01,890
a couple more same technique make

253
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:04,540
disease make the seeds I'm sorry

254
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,820
and the next thing we're gonna do now is

255
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,130
it's a little bit of that same color we

256
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,930
made the tree out of with a little bit

257
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,180
of yellow you should make a nice bright

258
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:17,260
green color and what we're gonna do with

259
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:20,829
this green is go back in here and just

260
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,560
put some highlights just make sure all

261
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:24,910
your trees can equal a lot of love he's

262
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,730
just as happy as his neighbor

263
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:31,810
you know I ever want to have angry

264
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,880
neighbors trees are no different so

265
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,949
we're gonna take some of this white mix

266
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,220
it into that try not to get this blue

267
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:45,279
mix into that same green just take this

268
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:48,630
lighter green color and just pop in some

269
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,100
indication of a little bush down here

270
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:55,269
and it should be floating on a nice

271
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,600
little yellow yellowish green submarine

272
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:00,339
and that's its Island and since we have

273
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,230
our island now what we're gonna do is

274
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:05,199
create a little bit of dirt so finally

275
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,060
we're gonna use my do to brown thumb and

276
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:10,800
we're gonna mix it with the remaining

277
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,800
white that we have here

278
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:20,380
all right what we're gonna be doing next

279
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:23,680
is creating gigantic trees in the

280
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,199
foreground and this could pretty much

281
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,449
ruin your painting even mr. Ross says

282
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:29,980
that this is a bravery test so we're

283
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:31,180
just gonna just try it we're just gonna

284
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,680
go ahead and try it because we're not

285
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,019
afraid this is our world we can do

286
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,240
whatever we want in our world even mess

287
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:42,100
it up so let's go for you gonna take the

288
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:47,529
edge of your brush and just start

289
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:48,910
dabbing at there's some green on there

290
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:53,620
that was an act that was some happy

291
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:59,649
mistake hold on just cover over that dab

292
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:01,630
in a way until you in what you have make

293
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:07,420
some bushes down here why not everybody

294
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:10,690
loves a good bush use a little bit more

295
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:14,110
pink but I am kind of lazy to make it

296
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:17,069
again it's really up to you guys to

297
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,959
decide how many bush how big your bushes

298
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:22,269
it's always on as your own personal

299
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,220
decision you decide your bush just just

300
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:28,350
end or in the middle or you can just

301
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,790
keep your bush going all the way

302
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,709
basically just paint in the corner of

303
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,790
black um so what we're gonna do is just

304
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:37,930
draw a little trunk straight in there

305
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,400
let me just check one more time what he

306
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,340
did

307
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:45,480
[Music]

308
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:47,880
Shh I got scared and I stopped pressing

309
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,920
down because it was so wide but you know

310
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,050
that's why it doesn't look good

311
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,810
never paint with fear let's try this

312
00:14:52,050 --> 00:15:06,450
again remember to make the sound is very

313
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:07,350
important and that's very thick that was

314
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:17,640
not intentional

315
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:20,990
no mistakes though shh shh

316
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,090
so not the best line in the world but

317
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,820
we'll see all right so I think I put a

318
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:29,390
little too much pain so I'm gonna try

319
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:33,270
and just just scrape a little bit off

320
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:41,160
scrape a little bit all make it a little

321
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:43,290
lighter oh I mean oh okay that's that's

322
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,360
a little less so then we're just gonna

323
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,070
take more of this green that we had

324
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,000
earlier and you're just gonna take the

325
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:55,290
corner and just kind of DAB I mean don't

326
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,270
be afraid just dab in some leaves

327
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,300
[Music]

328
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:03,750
now it's time to get that's right even

329
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:07,080
crazier what we're gonna do more trees

330
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:15,990
and even riskier than before cuz we're

331
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:17,970
going big okay you know what why not

332
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,910
let's make another tree let's go right

333
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,190
here let's go a little curvy but this

334
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:30,890
one not everybody's completely strained

335
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:34,730
if you know what I mean just like that

336
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:38,430
and we're just gonna just do a little

337
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:40,080
sarees we're not even making Z's anymore

338
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,550
so you doesn't even matter don't you

339
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,980
start getting a little bored of painting

340
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:47,820
you just start messing around kind of

341
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:50,370
give up a little bit but it's okay next

342
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,170
we are going to take some of that green

343
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,779
that we made earlier and just add a

344
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:58,200
little bit more yellow just make a

345
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:01,649
bright yellow color and just paint out

346
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,170
our individual bushes wherever you want

347
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:11,870
it to be you know there was a bush here

348
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:15,929
did you and that's supposed to be a bush

349
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:17,040
you know what let's make some rocks so

350
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:20,309
what we're gonna do is take some of the

351
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,750
brown little bit of the white what's

352
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:25,199
really gonna give it some color is some

353
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:28,079
black they add a bit of black very

354
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:33,179
lightly just drawing some indication

355
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,679
that there's some rocks right here and

356
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,840
then we're gonna go back to our

357
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,190
construction green dark chocolate brown

358
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,679
nice little path right here

359
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,630
nice big skid mark would have in a

360
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:51,660
lighter color i light your skid mark

361
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:56,370
give it some flavor just make a few more

362
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:59,280
bushes and just keep making your bushes

363
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,350
until you are satisfied and we're

364
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,710
basically just gonna make some sticks

365
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,960
with the dark brown from earlier these

366
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,650
little details are what really makes it

367
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,020
just some more sticky I guess huh

368
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,450
this pointers tired another way you can

369
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,760
add some sticks to your painting you

370
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:20,510
actually just take a clean knife and

371
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,730
you're just gonna carve through it and

372
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,860
just pretty much keep scratching up your

373
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,960
whole painting everything you work so

374
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,640
hard to do just scratch it another

375
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,940
technique you could use just get like a

376
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,309
cat and or dog and just let them run

377
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,440
loose and after adding all your

378
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:41,659
scratches pretty much the last thing to

379
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:44,600
do is to sign it one of the hardest

380
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:47,029
parts of cursive is the B so we're just

381
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,090
gonna make a squiggly line because no

382
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:51,309
one really reads this do they and there

383
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,309
you have it

384
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:54,309
something

385
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:16,309

386
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:20,750
