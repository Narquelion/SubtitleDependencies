00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
hey guys so as you can tell from the

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,140
title this video is gonna be about how

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,009
to know if you have ADHD or not and for

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,080
those of you that don't already know

5
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,160
ADHD is attention deficit hyperactive

6
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,540
disorder the reason I'm making this

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,219
video is because I feel like a lot of

8
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,049
people these days say or they think they

9
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,160
have ADHD but that's only because they

10
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,660
don't know what it's really like to have

11
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,010
as a little kid I was diagnosed with it

12
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,900
but I never took any meds for it so I

13
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,250
never knew what normal people thought

14
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,080
but I can't stand when people say that

15
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,699
ADHD is not a real thing and that it's

16
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,080
just an excuse for lazy people to blame

17
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,550
their laziness on what I can't stand

18
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,349
even more is that when people actually

19
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,609
do use it as an excuse even when they

20
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,080
don't have it just because they didn't

21
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,340
do well in school or they're bad at

22
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,930
studying or something but really there's

23
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,579
no excuse because I grew up with it and

24
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,290
I didn't take any medication for it I

25
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,820
still got all A's and B's and again I

26
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,200
also cheated a lot so after watching

27
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,489
this video if you can honestly say that

28
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,020
you relate to more of these things than

29
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,640
not then chances are I mean I'm not a

30
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,750
doctor but your brain is probably just

31
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,280
as messed up as mom I'm gonna be giving

32
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,140
you guys actual examples not those

33
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,489
typical ADHD joke you know which jokes

34
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,750
I'm talking about I'll be talking and

35
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,100
then all of a sudden pretend to be

36
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,140
distracted by something kind of like

37
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,910
what I'm about to do right oh look a

38
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,530
butterfly I mean even I made that joke

39
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,600
but only as a joke because that is such

40
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,039
a huge exaggeration it's really nothing

41
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,510
like that most of the time if they sound

42
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,680
unrealistic to you it's probably just

43
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,510
because you don't have it trust me

44
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,610
they're all real they actually do happen

45
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,080
I would know because sadly they're all

46
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,790
my personal experiences so without

47
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,290
further ado do and no more hesitation

48
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,880
here are some real examples to help you

49
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,979
guys know if you actually do or do not

50
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,100
I'm not even kidding there's an actual

51
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,720
butterfly right there I gotta see how

52
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,070
many of these you can relate to go you

53
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,570
meet someone new and then five seconds

54
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,070
after they've introduced themselves you

55
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,330
already forgot their name no matter how

56
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,799
hard you try to focus whenever you're

57
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,939
reading something like a book or a text

58
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,470
bloom read every single word on the page

59
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,939
you hear every single word in your head

60
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,290
you had five pages down the road you

61
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,549
have no idea what's going on or how you

62
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,600
got them you look at someone straight in

63
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,950
the eyes and rather than paying

64
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,390
attention to what they're saying you're

65
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,829
trying to decide which eye you normally

66
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,030
look at the left eye or the right eye

67
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,930
maybe it's the nose or the mouth or

68
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,310
maybe you're supposed to look at the

69
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,659
face as a whole but you already forgot

70
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,070
to do that because now all you see is a

71
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,329
bunch of face part to you there's no

72
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,590
such thing as sitting still you don't

73
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,360
realize it until someone tells you to

74
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,740
stop but you either been rapidly shaking

75
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,119
your legs hopping your hands or not in

76
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,500
your head to music that isn't there or

77
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,670
playing with whatever is currently in

78
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,990
your hands like a cell phone you're a

79
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,399
time traveler you go in take a five

80
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,960
minute Facebook break from work when you

81
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,130
come back it's an hour later sometimes

82
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,210
you have to remind yourself to smile

83
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,290
when you're with people or not because

84
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,790
you don't like them or because you're

85
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,780
upset it's because you have a bunch of

86
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,310
other thoughts going through your head

87
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,869
that aren't smile words no matter how

88
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,400
hard you try or how important the call

89
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,599
is when you're on the phone with someone

90
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,620
you have to be doing something else at

91
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,420
the same time you don't intentionally

92
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,650
procrastinate just most productive when

93
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,000
you have to get something done you work

94
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,439
best when you're under pressure again

95
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,030
you don't intentionally procrastinate

96
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,290
but you can never decide what you want

97
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,790
from a menu until you're under pressure

98
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,019
because the waiter just got to you you

99
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,250
have a bunch of incomplete things

100
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,569
because you're always jumping from one

101
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,920
thing to the next you leave your room to

102
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,209
go get your phone that you forgot in the

103
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,769
kitchen when you come back all you have

104
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,090
is a cup of water snacks and pretty much

105
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:34,109
everything that's not your phone a lot

106
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,549
of the times that you're on the phone

107
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:36,900
with people you freak out because you

108
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:38,310
can't find your phone you're not sure if

109
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,870
you just came downstairs or if you're

110
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,159
about to go home force yourself to burp

111
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,239
to remember what you had for lunch

112
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,069
and somebody tells you the thing about

113
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,060
one specific thing you can't because now

114
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,590
you're thinking about thinking about

115
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,489
things causing you to not think about

116
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,389
what you're supposed to be thinking

117
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,040
about detects something that makes

118
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:51,239
absolutely no sense because someone was

119
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,379
talking to you and you write out what

120
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,909
they were saying instead I can remember

121
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,569
a full phone number by repeating the

122
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,859
numbers in your head

123
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,299
the moment you start putting into the

124
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:58,799
keypad all the different sounds and the

125
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,359
key tones throw you off and you forget

126
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:01,739
you have to buy a lot of shampoo because

127
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,329
when you're in the shower you have the

128
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,889
most thoughts and you don't even realize

129
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:06,510
that you just wash your hair three times

130
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,829
you hate working in groups not because

131
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,450
of other people have bad ideas it's just

132
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,129
that their ideas distract yours you

133
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,450
overly set reminders for yourself when

134
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,560
important things are coming up because

135
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,120
you know you're gonna forget you always

136
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,290
have these silent awkward moments with

137
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,519
people because when you're talking to

138
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,410
them you always forget what you're about

139
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,180
to say mid-sentence and when you do it's

140
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:26,250
like like you have these you're very

141
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,040
indecisive I mean I guess this one kind

142
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,629
of applies to everyone or not or maybe

143
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,250
I'm last but not least you have ADHD

144
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,510
every single thought leads to another

145
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,799
thought and I can actually kind of learn

146
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,299
how to use that to my advantage when I'm

147
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,530
coming up with videos for example I'm

148
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,970
just gonna freestyle something right now

149
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,109
just to show you all my brain works see

150
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,549
you could be thinking about this video

151
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:43,680
and your mind could still go off in like

152
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,359
an infinite amount erections which is

153
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,500
the opposite of one direction maybe

154
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:49,199
that's how they got their name because

155
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,599
they all have ADHD ADHD like attention

156
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,099
deficit hyperactive disorder disorder I

157
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,510
mean who says it's a disorder anyway

158
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,769
speaking of disorder who came up with

159
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,629
the word disorder it kind of sounds like

160
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,669
a rapper trying to order at a bakery hey

161
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:02,370
let me get this ordered doe a deer a

162
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,470
female deer like Bambi Bambi whatever

163
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,019
happened to BAM a-and BAM see what is a

164
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,819
BAM see maybe they meant see BAM is when

165
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,620
the seagull is BAM that's like the waves

166
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,209
crashing and waves are created by win

167
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,500
and win can go in every single direction

168
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,400
which is the opposite of one direction

169
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,409
and that's what they got their name

170
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,299
that's how they got their name from the

171
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:20,019
multi-directional wind causing the waves

172
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,389
to crash agassiz bam bam see

173
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,190
and be dear like a rapper trying to get

174
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,169
disordered Oh creating the word disorder

175
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,000
and ADHD which is what all the guys in

176
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:30,159
one direction have which is the complete

177
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,139
opposite of the different direction this

178
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:33,400
video could go in I honestly don't know

179
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,720
how I remembered all that I mean it was

180
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,669
a freestyle so I didn't have to like

181
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,409
memorize anything but at the same time I

182
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:39,759
had to remember how to say it backwards

183
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:41,229
