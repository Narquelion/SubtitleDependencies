said og youtuber you were around when

36
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,890
did you start probably my current

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,049
channel to this day my current main

38
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,380
channel is oh six right

39
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,630
I had one channel before that in oh five

40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,040
that got like just someone gets my

41
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,840
password and delete all my videos you

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
know that is so what you know you know

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,380
what's crazy though YouTube has all

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,360
those backed up do they yeah I don't

45
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,610
know if sure say this I could probably

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,229
say this I deleted a ton of videos when

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,149
like copyright strike started to happen

48
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,610
yeah right when we got YouTube

49
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,599
partnership I think that was like oh

50
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,730
seven you didn't private him you just

51
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,160
deleted him I didn't know I didn't know

52
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,230
better

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,320
I was like I don't want to get sued yes

54
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,560
I just had started making money mm-hmm

55
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,120
and they flagged like I guess all of my

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,100
videos had music so I started deleting

57
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,840
like like all of them mm-hmm and then I

58
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,150
went back I think it was a couple years

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,380
later and they I don't know what

60
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,450
happened they updated YouTube or

61
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,900
something and they were all in my head

62
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,580
my inventory and like in my my videos so

63
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,340
like I have like lip syncs and stuff

64
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,710
that I'm like 5,000 views desk raised

65
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,170
may have everything and I deleted I know

66
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,030
for a fact I deleted them I every they

67
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,520

68
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,560

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,170
there oh I mean anything that got

71
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,820
deleted with that first channel it was

72
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,650
so stupid too cuz I was like I remember

73
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,870
I was really just excited I had like 500

74
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,670
subscribers on my first channel and it

75
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,190
was um there's a lot back then that was

76
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,390
a lot no well it was oh it was no okay

77
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,350
actually I had a couple it was one

78
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,600
called funky fresh

79
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,630
that was my first channel ever ever ever

80
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,910
and um and my channel my password was

81
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,500
funky cuz I was just dumb and lazy and I

82
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,570
was like and I always forget my password

83
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,760
and I think one day somebody had just

84
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,209
like was [ __ ] around and um I can say

85
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:31,690
that right yeah oh yeah somebody was a

86
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:33,760
[ __ ] alright and guess my password

87
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,290
and like it was literally I have maybe

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,970
10 videos that were there of just me

89
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,980
freestyling or doing whatever and they

90
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,620
all got deleted and and someone had just

91
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,750
uploaded like choreography videos you

92
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,980
know and then and that's when I started

93
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,750
the Timothy DeLaGhetto

94
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,160
account and um and then I lost that one

95
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,170
because I don't know if you remember but

96
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,080
way back then when YouTube first started

97
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,730
out there was no like moderation you

98
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,040
know no one really paying attention that

99
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,080
how everything worked but if somebody

100
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,800
just flagged your video enough it would

101
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,750
just get taken up

102
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,570
I do remember right so there was no you

103
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,010
know limited access or 18 or older it

104
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,350
was just automatically taken down yeah

105
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,300
and then they also had a three-strike

106
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,640
rule so if you had three videos taken

107
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,770
down your channel was just deleted you

108
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,000
know and then I think there was a time

109
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,100
on my original Timothy DeLaGhetto

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,650
channel where I think just like a

111
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,510
handful of like haters we're just

112
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,490
constantly flagging my videos

113
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,630
and within like a week and a half it was

114
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,140
like video taken out video takedown

115
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,340
video taken down channel suspended young

116
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,260
and then I had to start all over and I

117
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,180
think it's because I mean like you you

118
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,430
kind of I mean your content especially

119
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,650
back then you really like push the limit

120
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,750
right yeah and yeah well you know what

121
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,860
and and also back then I mean I remember

122
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,960
specifically a couple of videos that

123
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,130
that got deleted that week it was just

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,900
tell us about it

125
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,060
it was silly stuff bra like I wasn't

126
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,070
even taking it seriously yet it was

127
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,990
literally like a video of me and a

128
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,730
friend of mine like making out that's

129
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,720

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,820
you know this is way back it's like

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,280

upload this video me like playing with

137
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,770
my friends but you know and so you

138
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,770
didn't start off wrapping then it was it

139
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,870
was a combination of stuff it was um me

140
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,490
freestyling and then whatever just

141
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,680
random that we've got you to start

142
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,780
YouTube kind of what got me to start

143
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,980
YouTube specifically was you know my boy

144
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,530
PD flow yeah

145
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,920
so me and PD flow we went to high school

146
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:39,130
together and PD flow and my boy

147
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,140
super-ego and Rick we all went to high

148
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,730
school together and me people and Eric

149
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,100
specifically we used to make these like

150
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,840
short films in high school and we had

151
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,570
one that we did call Jason versus Gumby

152
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,120
that like PD flow put on his website and

153
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,890
and it started to get some traction

154
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,540
online like it was getting spread around

155
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,430
a lot not even when there weren't a lot

156
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,940
of you know there weren't websites to

157
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,950
share videos back right so his website

158
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,730
was like running out of bandwidth you

159
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,260
know I'm saying it would shut down

160
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,250
because we couldn't afford to keep the

161
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,870
website up with all the hits were

162
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:12,520
getting so one day I was on MySpace and

163
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:16,840
someone posted a bullet in my space is a

164
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,550
website where people used and someone

165
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,500
posted a bullet in it was like look at

166
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,330
these white girls dancing to Laffy Taffy

167
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,560
lol so I'm like okay what is this about

168
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,040
it clicked on it I watched the video i

169
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,350
LOL but i was like wow this is a website

170
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,150
where anybody can put any video and

171
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,800
it'll give you like an embed code for

172
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,140
your myspace this is crazy

173
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,120
so I told Peter I was a young man we can

174
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,350
just put our videos on this website and

175
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,650
we don't have to worry about bandwidth

176
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,020
and

177
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,880
that stuff so we put our little sortes

178
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,169
on there and then I was like maybe this

179
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,600
is a good way to get my face out there

180
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:49,990
so I just started uploading just like

181
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:53,770
silly stuff like me freestyling or like

182
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:56,259
you know lip-syncing and then I would

183
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,780
tag all my freestyle videos as Jin 106

announced is a different beast you know

255
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,700
yeah and like I can be quick and I don't

256
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,710
know maybe he is for all I know I

257
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,090
haven't heard him rap it feels more

258
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,860
though that Tim is like an authentic

259
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,380
genuine character who can like yeah

260
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,420
really you really fit that you know like

261
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,580
you it didn't seem like oh they're

262
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,260
trying to fit diversity here honey that

263
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,270
Asian audience is just like not Tim

264
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,130

266
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,160

268
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,750
for like the reboot you know um and so

269
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,580
when it was on back in the day I was

270
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,630
like yo I would be perfect on this show

271
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,220

275
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,560
this show is like rapping and being

276
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,630

278
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,470

279
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,850

282
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,510
me tell you some I heard Nick Cannon was

283
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,300
bringing Wilin out back so I followed

284
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:27,730
him on Twitter and then one day he

285
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,800
tweeted who's the funniest person online

286
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,170

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,420
hashtag Wilin out needs me I'll audition

288
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,700
personally so at that point you know I

289
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,820
had a decent YouTube following this pop

290
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,940
like 2012-2013 and so I got a bunch of

291
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:45,100
retweets and then someone deemed me and

292
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,140
they were like if you would really like

293
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,000

this address I was like sweet and and

295
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,440
also during that whole process a friend

296
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,670
of the producer who was a guy I knew was

297
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,750
like hey man I know the producer if you

really want to get in there I'll get you

299
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:02,080
in there and I went in for the audition

300
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,250
and Nick already knew who I was from he

301
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,130
knew me as a rapper

302
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:09,850
not necessarily comedian yeah cuz on

303
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:11,500
some super random random stuff he used

304
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,680
to manage this artist name collect car

305
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,170
and that year or the year before that

306
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,910
billboard came out with this chart

307
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,200
called the Uncharted chart and it was

308
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,380
basically people who were kind of doing

309
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,840
their thing online and and I was number

310
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,130
one on when they premiered the the chart

311
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,020
because you know I was doing like I was

312
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,260
doing music and stuff too yeah and so I

313
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,060
guess Nick just saw me on that list so I

314
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,650
auditioned and they had me like

315
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,560
freestyle and we played some improv

316
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:41,140
games and and it was stuff like they'd

317
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,390
say Kevin Hart is in front of you right

318
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,490
now dissing with a rap you know stuff

319
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,990
like that yeah and we do that and they

320
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,460
called me back for the group audition to

321
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,470

322
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,390

339
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,860
looking to fulfill that kind of token

340
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,650
Asian spot you know cuz a majority black

341
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:39,700
cast and it came down to me and

342
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:41,470
dumbfounded oh and um and if you ask the

343
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,450

348
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,420
freestyle guy

349
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,580
I know his freestyle is crazy and I

350
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,110

00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,589
video and stuff yeah yeah yeah all your

364
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,449
stuff was always like really good like

365
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:31,629
really smart well thought out thanks me

366
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:33,579
and sometimes it would just be so like

367
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:35,319
when they would go at you yeah I mean

368
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,240
maybe I have a bias because I'm Asian

369
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:39,939
but all the jokes are the same like

370
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,350
every single time I don't know maybe I

371
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:43,060
mean I'm sure you saw a lot oh you're

372
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,740
right well that's the thing too is like

373
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,629
scene with the Nick Cannon jokes I know

374
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,040
that was really annoying to see well the

375
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:49,120
thing is when people complain about you

376
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,620
know they only came out you with the

377
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,269
same jokes I mean they did but at the

378
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,160
same time everybody kind of played their

379
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:55,870
part like I got it you know everyone has

380
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,550
their role in the show where they would

381
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,439
get made fun of for the same stuff like

382
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,449
the fat dude would get the fat jokes and

383
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,790
you know the white girl Justina she gets

384
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:05,740
all the you're a [ __ ] joke centers but

385
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,910
even if it's the same kind of joke it's

386
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,310
the way you tell it right totally

387
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,139
so like the little to me you and the

388
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,879
short black guy was really conceited yes

389
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:14,230
really he's so clever with it he's

390
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,759
clever and that's the thing and there's

391
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,189
another white guy on there named sharone

392
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,490
from Canada who's also yeah he's he's

393
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:23,980
good at switching up old jokes and

394
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,209
putting a new spin on him you know and I

395
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,220
was tell people I'm like the thing about

396
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:30,670
those the reason why those jokes were so

397
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,689
easy for me to rebuttal was cuz I've

398
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,439
been hearing those jokes in the whole

399
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:37,720
life yeah yeah so I mean not of the

400
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:40,029
whole cast oh actually you know you you

401
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,519
roasted a lot of like celebrities - out

402
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:43,660
of everybody who like you met during

403
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,600
doing the show you met a bunch of

404
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:51,059
celebrities right yeah who was the worse

405
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,939
on the show like as a like just as a

406
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,930
talk about your personal experimental

407
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:57,910
areas pretty much every week well you

408
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,319
know what was annoying his first time on

409
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,579
and then the second time on he was super

410
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,350
nice yes so I don't know what changed

411
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:05,019
but like the first time Rick Ross came

412
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,850
on he came on with like 15 different

413
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:08,920
people that they insisted would all be

414
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,660
on the stage you know I'm saying and it

415
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,850
was very like the whole atmosphere was

416
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,899
very tense you know because I feel like

417
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,100
he didn't wanna look dumb and even even

418
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,529
like there was kind of like a little

419
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,209
they were like hey guys you know no no

420
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,520
fat jokes for Rick Ross and that was

421
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,870
yeah there's no veg sometimes sometimes

422
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,820
what kind of coming with certain

423
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,190
restrictions like and and don't touch

424
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,930
areas and he they were like no fat jokes

425
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,670
but the hidden but then Nick made a fat

426
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,440
joke so it's not like you know him as

427
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,940
the boss man I guess he was allowed but

428
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,370
then the next time Rick Ross came on

429
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,320
super nice didn't have his whole

430
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,490
entourage and it was down to make jokes

431
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,590
I mean especially since I guess he had

432
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,360
lost a lot of weight but that was

433
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,610
probably one of the most like I don't

434
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,950
know just like the the vibe felt a

435
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,080
little yeah you know I mean it might be

436
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,880
also like he was hesitant you know yeah

437
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,440
not sure how this goes and then after

438
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,210
that show aired you know maybe he saw

439
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,190
like a jump in sales jump the extremes

440
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,510
he's like oh this is good for me I think

441
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,340
everybody's a little weary to go on

442
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,660
while a now because they don't wanna you

443
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,980
know they don't wanna feel like you know

444
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,630
they're gonna get made fun of and it's

445
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,460
gonna go viral or anything like that but

446
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,530
especially that first season was kind of

447
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,870
hard to get guests but I think now that

448
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,610
it's been on for like a few years now

449
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,960
and people realize it's all just fun and

450
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:21,310
games like movin yeah exactly it's cool

451
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,320
so you're cool with Nick Cannon then

452
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,500
next cool yeah no we're we're good we're

453
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,910
good

454
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,140
I mean it's not like we're homies I mean

455
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,550
it's always like you see people make

456
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,830
jokes about the boss you know yeah there

457
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,420
was a made it seem like I don't know

458
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,460
there's a lot of things you people would

459
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,900
say your cast would say yeah and I was

460
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,500
always like do you guys actually like

461
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:40,630
him like that was all you know it's all

462
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,130
just fun and games Nick makes a good

463
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,190
dude Nick if anything Nick is a very

464
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:48,370
supportive guy you know if he like FS

465
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,290
with you as a person he will put you in

466
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,090
other things he'll let you know if he

467
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,340
has like a part in a movie he wants you

468
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,870
for and he's just a supportive dude

469
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,250
actually what I heard through the

470
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,590
grapevine I don't even know how true

471
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,110
this is but what I heard about the

472
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,360
reason why they decided not to bring me

473
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,589
back another season is I heard that Nick

474
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,410
was going through like the list of

475
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:11,230
people of the cast and he and he said

476
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,030
this is what I heard I heard he was like

477
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,740
he got to my name and was like I feel

478
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,750
like Tim could be doing more and then

479
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,400
that's why it's sad to let me go so I

480
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,959
don't know if that was just like I'm

481
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,940
gonna say that and make myself feel

482
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,500
better about like letting him go or if

483
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,110
that was um that's how he genuinely

484
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,780
feels by the way it's all up yeah yeah

485
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,710
but you said you were trying to not like

486
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,370
you're trying to get off the show for a

487
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,200
while anyway

488
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,360
yeah I mean I I didn't really voice that

489
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,430
to too many people maybe like a producer

490
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,559
that I was really close to shout out to

491
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,990
Rachel

492
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,159
and a few cast members that you know

493
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,320
just in the group chat I'm like you know

494
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:45,899
what guys I mean maybe this is it for me

495
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,820
but I was but it was so hard to say no

496
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,409
when it's like because we shoot the

497
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,370
whole season in two and a half three

498
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:56,940
weeks so it's like why wouldn't I go on

499
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:59,700
a free trip for three weeks and live in

500
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,220
a hotel for free have fun you know get

501
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,379

with celebrities and get a check you

503
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:09,600

504
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,340
got a little old for me you know so it

505
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,860
was cool

506
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,990
well I guess continuing with a wild and

507
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,159
out stuff there's a brief moment in time

508
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,659
I don't know if you're still doing this

509
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:21,179
I haven't seen you tweet about it but

510
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:23,340

598
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,730

601
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:52,010
up through this is like you know

602
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:54,230
lifestyle food channel website day we're

603
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,590
looking for content and so they hit me

604
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,020
up

605
00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:00,080
the interest of like acquiring the show

606
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,820
and and so I was down cuz you know I

607
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,929
wasn't making any money doing it cuz

608
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,779
like you know I had to pay for like the

609
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:08,630
food and the basses and the crew and the

610
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:09,140

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,450
Thrillist

612
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,370

I can like travel all over the country

615
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,049
because originally I could only afford

616
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:20,299
to do it in LA in San Diego so now that

617
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:21,770

618
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:24,799

I have bad was expressions no like just

644
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,110
like just being conscious of what my

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,230
face is doing yeah like you can't

646
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,360

if anything my my jaws droop a little

670
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,620
bit yeah like I don't like I try to be

671
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,270
more conscious of that yeah I have to I

672
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,700
learned I should probably think about

673
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,410
that a little bit more be more conscious

674
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,120
of your face people have been telling me

675
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,590
that's hard it's hard to always be

676
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,419
conscious of your face if anything I'm

677
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,710
just Jonah my posture is terrible my

678
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:34,450
face is droopy

679
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:39,309
you're pretty self-aware though I mean

680
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:41,470
like to be a battle rapper you have to

681
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:43,530
really know yourself right cuz I mean if

682
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,190
anything now I'm always just kind of uh

683
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,210
especially when the cameras are

684
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,730
following us around like when we're

685
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,200
shooting send foods I wear more that

686
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,140
there are people potentially like taking

687
00:24:50,200 --> 00:25:00,340
cell phone footage so I try to like just

688
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:01,929
like stand up straight my chin gets kind

689
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,940
of squishy when I'm just looking down

690
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:05,530
that stuff really bother you then when

691
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,210
you would see the playback or is it

692
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,900
because yeah sometime think it'll affect

693
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,940
your what your viewership or no just for

694
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,130

695
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,659

00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,309
I'm grateful for this light you have

697
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:19,539
here and I'm also grateful that you're

698
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,720
shooting me from the right side because

699
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:24,970

700
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,919

this side yeah you rather get shot on

703
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:32,169
that side yeah for your shoot we both

704
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,470
had our bad sides oh I didn't know that

705
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:36,490
that was your bad side too yeah like if

706
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,100
you would have said that we could have

707
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,600
made not an argument I don't want to be

708
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,280

and it sounds silly for people that like

712
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,610
don't really consider that a thing but

713
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,159
if you've seen yourself on camera enough

714
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,630
like girls get it girls get it they

715
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,250

constantly preach like these people

738
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,450

739
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,520
the physical right I mean and you know

740
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,280

00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:12,550
physically I'm cute whenever people

746
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,870
or whatever even with like my ex or my

747
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:22,300
or my wife and then and people would try

748
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:32,830
to defend me like maybe she doesn't only

749
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:34,960
care about looks I'm like oh hold on I

750
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,970
feel like yeah like confidence is

751
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,880
important confidence is key you know and

752
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,290
even when I was like a little kid and

753
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,910
you know I was thinking about this the

754
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,710
other day cuz someone's like dude how

755
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:47,700
are you so confident and and I would

756
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:50,050
always give the the answer of like and

757
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,070
and this is true to not that this isn't

758
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:54,220
true but I would say you know I always

759
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,560
felt like it life is so short why waste

760
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,500
time worrying about what other people

761
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,910
think about you you know cuz I feel like

762
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,260
people are people are gonna find you

763
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,820
ugly and people are gonna find you hot

764
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,500
and like people are gonna love you and

765
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:09,130
people gonna hate you but at the end of

766
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,080
the day um worrying on that and dwelling

767
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:13,570
on that is really gonna keep you from

768
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,040
enjoying life to its full potential you

769
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,330
know cause like if you're if you're

770
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,650
self-conscious about like oh my god how

771
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,120
do I look if I'm doing this and like

772
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,650
this person's gonna hate me and this

773
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,000
girl's gonna reject me you're there's so

774
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,160
many things that you're not gonna try

775
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,630
and attempt and you just never know do

776
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,600
you do you feel like part of that too

777
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,920
though is because you kind of prep for

778
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,230
that like you've kind of like like for

779
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,429
example like sitting on that side

780
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,669
like showing your good side do you feel

781
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:38,260
like I know that I prepped for this like

782
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:39,820
I put a little bit makeup on but I feel

783
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,320
like I look good so I'm confident enough

784
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,610
to put that energy out there if you

785
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,900
hadn't done all that stuff do you feel

786
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,370
like you would feel the same way okay

787
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,330
see in this and that's and that's funny

788
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,210
that you brought that up because I was

789
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,380
thinking like okay why why am I really

790
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,360
confident because you know how I said

791
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,010
life is too short to care about it and

792
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,750
then I started thinking why don't I care

793
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,510
why didn't I ever care even as a little

794
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:03,190
kid and I realized this is the reason

795
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:07,540
dude I loved girls so much that's like a

796
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:09,400
little kid I was never like worried that

797
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:14,559
oh this girl thinks I'm ugly I was like

798
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:17,140
I'm gonna try and kiss this girl pretty

799
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,059
I'm gonna hold her hand you know I think

800
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,820
not gonna lie I feel like that was my

801
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,370
main motivator for just like not giving

802
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,980
a F growing up you know it's like you

803
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,500
know what did I think this was cute um I

804
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:33,580
know I'm hilarious I always tell people

805
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:35,919
like I know I'm not like the guy that

806
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:39,669
walks into a room and a girl's like man

807
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:43,600
I'm gonna suck this dudes penis you know

808
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:46,000
but I say give me like ten minutes of

809
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,010
conversation by the punch bowl and the

810
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,500
chips and she's like you know I might

811
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:55,540
suck this dude's penis because at some

812
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,610
point there must have been a time where

813
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,650
you realize oh I'm good at conversation

814
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,000
right so I mean to get to that point to

815
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,730
even talk to girls most people your

816
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,559
average person I would say even most

817
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:07,330
people in general you don't naturally as

818
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:08,049
a kid you know that oh you know what I'm

819
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,880
good at this

820
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,049
until you make a realization it must

821
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,380
have been a moment in your life when you

822
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:17,169
realize like you know I can do this

823
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,150
maybe I mean I just um were you always

824
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:21,160
just naturally gifted that way I

825
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,200
wouldn't even say it I was gifted I just

826
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,450
I just feel like I liked making people

827
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,130
laugh uh-huh um and I was always doing

828
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,280
that ever since I was a little kid um I

829
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,690
think my mom always told me I was cute

830
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,840
to help build my self-confidence you

831
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:39,250

833
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,740

in the world like I'm really not but I

839
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,350

was always as in me you know like

843
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:05,370

in some type of tone yeah you know I

869
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,570

870
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,710
you know we definitely had an episode a

871
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,020
couple weeks ago we're just talking

872
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:36,120
about the emos random [ __ ] and I love

873
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,710
that episode but you know the thing

874
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,890
about is I love talking about random

875
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:43,470
stuff yeah but you know for sure like

876
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,600
for titles and getting people to click

877
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,460
on it it helps that you know sexual

878
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,710
things that always helps that always

879
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,600
helps and people will be in the comments

880
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,770
complaining that you know do you only

881
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,970
talk about one thing all the time

882
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,110
but then it's like those are the

883
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,049
episodes to get to most of you I know

884
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:00,960
you know I'm saying and also like if you

885
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:03,190
watch the actual video the whole episode

886
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,630
we're not just talking about that yeah

887
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,600
you know that might be the title right

888
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:09,280
but like shut up and watch it a lot of

889
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,380
times it's like it's the thing that's

890
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,909
most impressionable and it sticks with

891
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,929
them which is why they feel like oh

892
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,280
there's the only thing you're talking

893
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:16,659
exactly but it just means like you guys

896
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:24,600
compliment in a way hey thanks man you

898
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:31,799
like sexual conversations specifically

899
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,929
for like like in like the young

900
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:37,570
asian-americans growing up you know I

901
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:39,159
don't remember anybody that was like

902
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,650
Asian and talking about stuff like that

903
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:46,630
and that was a big reason why I made my

904
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:48,700
content so kind of like dirty in the

905
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:51,580
beginning because I was like I want to

906
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,289
be like from just the from the first

907
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,440
like clique I want to I want people to

908
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:58,630
be like oh this is not they this is not

909
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,720
a stereotype you know and I was like and

910
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,039
and and I first of all you know I I like

911
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,429
talking about dirty stuff you know I

912
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,409
enjoy butts and talking about butts and

913
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:09,879
stuff like that huh and but then I

914
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:11,740
remember you know when I was making my

915
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:13,540
youtube content I was like people were

916
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,190
already kind of shocked when they would

917
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,619
click on my rap videos you know cuz

918
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,300
growing up in in LA and I feel like when

919
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:22,089
you're in more diverse cities it's not

920
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,339
weird to see somebody that is Asian and

921
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:26,710
and and raps and like maybe like walks

922
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:28,089
and and talks in a certain way but then

923
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,159
when I was getting clicks from people

924
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:32,230
who were like you know I wouldn't even

925
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,369
be saying anything like on some gangster

926
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,869
[ __ ] I would just have like a backwards

927
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:37,210
hat on and they're like this dude wants

928
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:39,250
to be a gangster so bad and I remember

929
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:43,510
those comments for you what do you mean

930
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:45,190
I'm literally just I'm chilling I'm just

931
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,570
wearing a backwards hat I'm just I'm you

932
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,639
know I'm rapping a little bit I'm not

933
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,859
saying Oh nor do I claim to ever be a

934
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,889
gangster but for people that aren't used

935
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:55,540
to that they are so just taken aback by

936
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:57,010
it they don't know what to do so I was

937
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,810
like okay well let me do this - like I

938
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,010
like talking about dirty stuff I'm gonna

939
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,480
talk about dirty stuff I've never seen

940
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,339
an Asian dude talk about dirty stuff and

941
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,660
I felt like for a whole generation of

942
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:08,150
young Asian Americans who

943
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,010
maybe necessarily didn't have anyone

944
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:13,430
older to talk to about that I kind of

945
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,720
became like um an older brother / uncle

946
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,710
when they had questions like that you

947
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,880
know so when I was doing my dude

948
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,740
delegate Oh stuff where they would send

949
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,180
me their relationship and sex questions

950
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:24,500
that was one of the first things to

951
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:26,720
really kind of blow my channel up you

952
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,900
know cause like some of these kids that

953
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,880
used to watch me are now like dude you

954
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,890

13 years old I'm in college now you help

956
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,580

957
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,500
you know they had they really had no one

958
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:44,090
that they could talk to about that yeah

959
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:45,620
yeah I've gotten that comment or for

960
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:47,720
sure yeah crazy

961
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,490
well it's speaking of that it's pretty

962
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,130
funny cuz I was told I told my dad I was

963
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,230
like hey this weekend cuz he watches the

964
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:56,420

by that he means he's seen your stuff

968
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,970
yeah I was like no he's actually like

969
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,680
he's a really cool guy like he's not

970
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:09,260
every everything when we talk is not

971
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,570
just like yeah like I did take sexuals

972
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,700
yeah cuz you know he goes by like oh he

973
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:16,460
sees your podcast title right oh they

974
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:19,910
know no he's very is very normal person

975
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,260
- it's like when people judge you by

976
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,550
like a couple YouTube videos yes you

977
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,320
know especially you know especially

978
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,540
early YouTube was so like hey guys

979
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,830
what's up blah you know I'm saying jump

980
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,550
cuts and [ __ ] it's like you want again

981
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,900
you want to keep everything so

982
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,340
fast-paced and it's the tone is

983
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,560
completely changed now yeah but I

984
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,720
remember back then putting up content

985
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,400
like that and people meeting me that I

986
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,470
was just like having food with or

987
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,210
chilling with and they be like wow

988
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,920
you're really calm I thought you were

989
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,410
gonna be annoying and I'm like no and

990
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,690
I'm like that's me but I mean it's me

991
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:51,350
times 10 you know like real me isn't

992
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:53,660
always just yeah which is why I like the

993
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:56,120
whole podcast era right cuz it gives you

994
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,920
a chance to actually chill and have a

995
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,420
conversation that's that's why I wanted

996
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,220
to do it in the first place well when

997
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:04,790
people when I first started it everybody

998
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:07,040
was like was Ryan so depressed I was

999
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,870
just like no this is just how I am but

1000
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,490
like when when I have to do a vlog I

1001
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,410
just gotta turn it up a little bit you

1002
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:14,060
know chug and extra energy at the time I

1003
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:18,790
didn't have a ninja milk chug an extra -

1004
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,790
Red Bulls you know ninja milk engine

1005
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:23,690
thanks to him but yeah like people

1006
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,370
thought and I don't blame them because

1007
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,330
that's all they've seen right unless

1008
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,980
they watch our second channel which is

1009
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,430
behind the scenes button that's besides

1010
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,810
the point

1011
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,760
and they see you chilling and talking

1012
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,930
and exactly that we he's mad it's the

1013
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,970
same thing and being conscious of your

1014
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,590
face and stuff he's he's mad you know

1015
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,150
he's like he's not happy he's when I

1016
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,220
used to watch back the vlogs when I used

1017
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,990
to edit them I would make sure that

1018
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,240
every single clip every since split

1019
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,280
second was if I looked a little bit mad

1020
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,750
he would comment on it so hmm

1021
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,940
I was calm this is me not being

1022
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:52,040
conscious of my face right yeah and

1023
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,420
that's why people think I'm mad or sad I

1024
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,460
don't know well you know the thing is

1025
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,590
and also you know I feel like your

1026
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,570
audience is uh you know was really young

1027
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:01,640
at first they were yeah you need to

1028
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:04,550
cater to that yeah I kind of stopped

1029
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:07,850
well I mean Shea we're old I know I know

1030
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:09,770
we are you guys audience is grown up you

1031
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,570
know but also like you know YouTube's

1032
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,370
constantly the audiences are changing

1033
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,560
people are growing out of it new people

1034
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:17,840
are coming in yeah um how have you guys

1035
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,630
adjusted to that because you guys are

1036
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,520
getting older you have new interests you

1037
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,990
guys own the places which is something

1038
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,150
that you know kids are like I don't

1039
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,290
understand anything about this you know

1040
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,850
I didn't understanding about it until

1041
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:30,410
like a year ago when I bought the house

1042
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,240
that buying house is one of most

1043
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:34,040
confusing things I've ever done it's a

1044
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,120
lot of work yeah more than you think oh

1045
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,250
that's crazy

1046
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,180
you should the kids out there that we

1047
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,400
eventually want to buy a house if you're

1048
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,080
in high school look into it a little bit

1049
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,820
beforehand just you understand stuff you

1050
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,080
have a realtor I did I did thank God or

1051
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,520
else I would've been completely lost

1052
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,720
yeah they don't teach you that [ __ ] in

1053
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,820
school don't that's the stuff they

1054
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,650
should be teaching kids exactly in high

1055
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,380
school dude when I was going through it

1056
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:56,870
I was like why was there not one class

1057
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:59,000
on buying a house or something or like

1058
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:00,920
uh or a chapter in like you could have

1059
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,350
got screwed over at any moment yeah in

1060
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,360
your ear tour was a bad person I was

1061
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:08,060
signing things I was just like okay yeah

1062
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,250
I know my rotor so it was like fortunate

1063
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,610
for me but I couldn't even I knew

1064
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,350
nothing

00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:14,060
yeah same boat as my parents for

1066
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,360
everything I was literally just like oh

00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:20,320
just tell me just tell me what's a sign

1068
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,320
you know you don't even own the place

1069
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:25,220
but yeah in terms of getting older yeah

1070
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,480
it's been a long time we've been on

1071
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,490

yeah same so it's like in 13 years

1075
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:40,869
almost 14 years yep and I'm always kind

1076
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:43,760
of I feel fortunate that my audience

1077
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:46,700
grew with me you know because I feel

1078
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:50,650
like you know we've we've seen people

1079
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:54,020
and channels that were really popping

1080
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:55,730
and maybe they were doing one specific

1081
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,780
type of thing for a long time and maybe

1082
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,540
they were catering to a specific

1083
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,730
audience and then you know that only

1084
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,830
worked for so long before people are

1085
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,900
like you know I've outgrown this you

1086
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,609
know so the fact that people you know

1087
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,770
still tuned in as much as they do I'm

1088
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:10,849
like huh oh thank god that's crazy

1089
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,770
of course it's not the same like it used

1090
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,760
to be yeah how about you you how's your

1091
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:16,609
audience you feel like they've been with

1092
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,580
you it's I I would say for sure

1093
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:20,540
cuz I've seen it like the age ranges

1094
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,040
obviously it's hard to say in the

1095
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,320
beginning because it's 13 to 17 but

1096
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,090
really that means 13 in under mmm

1097
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,869
because you weren't allowed to make

1098
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:32,630
accounts back then right and for the

1099
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:34,430
longest time it was slowly starting to

1100
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,080
go up and I was trying to force myself

1101
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,900
to get back down there because that's

1102
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,760
where the biggest group is so I would

1103
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,130
say and I just talked about in one of my

1104
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,660
videos but like I used to try so hard to

1105
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:47,030
cater to that group and getting the

1106
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:49,160
young ones coming in that I would have

1107
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,930
to dumb down the content hmm and take

1108
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,070
jokes that I thought was funny and kill

1109
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:54,890
them for myself

1110
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:56,869
make it good for other people yeah and I

1111
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,730
used to hurt like it literally hurt me

1112
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:00,560
and I would see it that's so funny

1113
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,790
because it I had the same thing happen

1114
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,380
to me but in a completely different way

1115
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,210
because of course I never catered to a

1116
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,660
younger audience I was always just kind

1117
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:11,150
of out there yes stuff right but where

1118
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,770
where that happened to me was you know

1119
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,330
of course you know a lot like a lot of

1120
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:17,830
my skits were kind of dirty kind of like

1121
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:20,599
slapstick II in the beginning and um but

1122
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:26,119
personally like the type of stuff I like

1123
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:29,750
to watch is like way drier like weird

1124
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:31,849
almost you know and so when I'm like I

1125
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,820
really want to make some content that I

1126
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:36,560
would watch I'm like audience isn't

1127
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,390
gonna get this they're not gonna like

1128
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,220
this I think we're very similar one of

1129
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,470
the funniest videos I think I've seen of

1130
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,789
yours was just you and that dude dance

1131
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,679
and just rain yeah

1132
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:48,049
that's my favorite video but I never

1133
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,369
done I can see if like like that stuff's

1134
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:51,529
funny to me but if I were to post

1135
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:51,859
something that I would get it would not

1136
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:54,559
work

1137
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:56,299
yeah but that did okay for you that did

1138
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,399
great for me and but that was one of the

1139
00:41:56,299 --> 00:42:00,649
ones I was nervous about yes I was like

1140
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:02,719
but that was also a video that I was so

1141
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:04,669
proud of to be a part of the house I

1142
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,349
don't care if they like this or not

1143
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:09,589
yeah and luckily they loved it you know

1144
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:12,429
but you know that that's definitely out

1145
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:15,319
of you know in my mind like kind of

1146
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:17,209
range of content it's like it's one of

1147
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:19,819
the special ones oh yeah what's that

1148
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:20,689
dude same just rain just rain just ran

1149
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:22,309
yeah

1150
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:24,439
should I just learned that you're not

1151
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:31,039
supposed to call people Indian what

1152
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:34,669
ethnicity is he he's Indian oh no okay

1153
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:36,439
well I just learned why people are

1154
00:42:34,669 --> 00:42:38,149
called Indians Native American people

1155
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,869
are quiet Indians but there's a I used

1156
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:40,219
to mix up the two

1157
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:41,809
I think that guys actually end you know

1158
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:44,029
I know yeah but what I mean is like I

1159
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,709
didn't want to say either because I

1160
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:47,479
didn't want to mess up just in case yeah

1161
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:48,619
and I used to get mixed up the two and I

1162
00:42:47,479 --> 00:42:53,119
just I just learned about the whole

1163
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:55,399
history I'm very ignorant but like I

1164
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,589
mean I want to learn so I watch things

1165
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:59,059
in that that's what I learned I'm I have

1166
00:42:57,589 --> 00:43:00,259
to be very careful when I speak that so

1167
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:02,659
I don't tweet a lot because I'm always

1168
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:05,779
scared to get cancelled right um let's

1169
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:08,839
talk about that you guys are from an

1170
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:10,639
older generation of social media where

1171
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:13,699
you know there's a lot of things said

1172
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:16,819
that you know potentially be like whoa

1173
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:20,389
whoa whoa these before you know yeah I'm

1174
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:22,399
surprised you're nothing you've said has

1175
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:25,130
gotten you into trouble really not you

1176
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:28,039
know what it's like look for sure there

1177
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,630
is content that I put out in the past

1178
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:32,389
that wouldn't put out now right like

1179
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:34,459
stuff I wasn't a lean guy and I might

1180
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:37,669
have private a couple videos just with

1181
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:39,589
the change of the times you know and and

1182
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:42,619
and I also understood

1183
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:45,889
like I of course cancel culture as a

1184
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:52,369
comedian is like it's annoying right but

1185
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:55,639
I also understand that the like the just

1186
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:57,590
society is maturing and growing you feel

1187
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:01,300
me it's like things are different

1188
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:04,070
and that is okay and I'm not mad at that

1189
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,390
so there are definite like and I feel

1190
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:08,420
like back on Twitter especially there

1191
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:10,160
was kind of a thing where you were

1192
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,050
trying like people are people are trying

1193
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,960
to be edgy like you would say just crazy

1194
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:16,250
[ __ ] just to like get real yeah get

1195
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,390
retweets and get laughs because you know

1196
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:20,840
like it was like who cares it's Twitter

1197
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:21,440
you know and I've definitely gone into

1198
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,700
my past

1199
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,990
tweets done a little search I mean like

1200
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,420
you know I wanna just delete a whole

1201
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:28,010
bunch of these because I don't in ones

1202
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,890
that weren't even bad but it was just

1203
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:32,480
like words that were kind of like um

1204
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,940
like like anything that came up that was

1205
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:39,260
like even like specific you know if it

1206
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:40,400
was like oh um I met this cool black

1207
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,930
woman today

1208
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,600
I'm like let me just delete black woman

1209
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:46,640
just in case anyone wants to go you know

1210
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,060
find some issue with this they don't see

1211
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:52,520
eye to eye I don't agree with that I

1212
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:54,410
feel like that I I am mad at cancer

1213
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,090
culture because I think I think that's

1214
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:57,230
ridiculous like yeah even it's

1215
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,550
especially if it's a long time ago and

1216
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,290
let's say there's stuff you wouldn't say

1217
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,480
now right if you found a video that you

1218
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:04,580
deleted and someone reuploaded and they

1219
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,870
decided to cancer you for that I'd be

1220
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,330
pissed I'll be like this isn't right

1221
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:10,820
even if unless you were like I stand by

1222
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,320
it right you know I get it but like I

1223
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,720
don't think I think there's this mob

1224
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,220
mentality that happens and that's that's

1225
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,450
the difference if someone can say

1226
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,920
something offensive and the people

1227
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,630
offended should be offended but it

1228
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,980
doesn't mean everyone needs to be

1229
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,660
offended and agree with the offended

1230
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,160
people no I totally agree I totally

1231
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:28,430
agree and I think everyone has the right

1232
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,200
to be offended yep I think I I people

1233
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:31,280
shouldn't feel obligated to agree with

1234
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,940
you if you're offended and I totally

1235
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,520
agree with that

1236
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,410
but at the same time I'm like I'm still

1237
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,320
gonna delete these tweets oh yeah I mean

1238
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,670
like don't why take the risk right right

1239
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:44,690
yeah because I mean that's the stupid

1240
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:46,580
part look like I said I'm not mad at the

1241
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,860
fact that things that we said back then

1242
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:51,620
maybe aren't as acceptable now yeah but

1243
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:54,080
I am mad at mob mentality and the fact

1244
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:57,320
that people are mad at you for something

1245
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,700
you said 10 years ago because or that

1246
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,360
they want to cancel you for that because

1247
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:05,030
it's like what like look you had to have

1248
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,710
been asleep before you can be woke you

1249
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:09,500
don't say and so how you gonna be like

1250
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:11,150
mad at me when I was sleep like I was

1251
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,470
sleep yes

1252
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,910
how are you gonna be mad at me for that

1253
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:18,060
I didn't know what's going on I was

1254
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:19,590
sleep yeah and I'm and all I'm saying is

1255
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,920
right now all the people who are

1256
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:24,030
currently quote unquote woke how do they

1257
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,610
know that everything they're doing right

1258
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:29,610
now 10 years from now isn't asleep yeah

1259
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:31,350
you know so uh it's it's one thing to be

1260
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:33,450
upset by something in the time like okay

1261
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:34,980
I get it I wouldn't say certain things I

1262
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,600
would say I would have said like ten

1263
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,860
years ago right but how do you know that

1264
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,180
what you're saying right now isn't gonna

1265
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,740
be a friends of ten years from now

1266
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,570
I mean exactly and the thing about it is

1267
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,460
like men even five years ago it's like I

1268
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,690
feel like you your mind and everything

1269
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,210
can grow so much you can become a

1270
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:50,730
completely different person you know so

1271
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:52,740
I it's it's silly to hold that over

1272
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,960
someone's head forever

1273
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,610
yeah I agree yeah and a lot of times I

1274
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,670
think it's especially with social media

1275
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:01,320
um you feel so isolated and not like

1276
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:03,030
real connections but you want to feel

1277
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,320
like a part of something bigger mm-hmm

1278
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,700
so a lot of times a lot of people in

1279
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,680
these mom mentalities are this walk

1280
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,360
mentality they don't even really truly

1281
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,500
believe it they're just like I'm just

1282
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,970
saying what I think I'm supposed to

1283
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,130
because everybody else is doing it

1284
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,870
mm-hmm you know any gets likes yeah like

1285
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:18,810
that and it's which is the ironic then

1286
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:20,790
you feel a part of it yeah so that's the

1287
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:22,440
new culture and I think people are

1288
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,180
trying to fit in for one and it's the

1289
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,860
majority so it's easier you're right to

1290
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,270
jump on that bandwagon I think it's

1291
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,350
gonna switch eventually because people

1292
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,820
are getting tired of that I think it's

1293
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,990
already starting to happen you see

1294
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,400
comments like the people are kind of

1295
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:34,830
getting sick of it they're over it yeah

1296
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,600
but I think another part of that mob

1297
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:39,060
mentality is the fact that there's just

1298
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,380
a internet culture there's I don't know

1299
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,960
what it is there's like people who just

1300
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,310
like to make people feel worse and I

1301
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,410
think part of it is because they're not

1302
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:48,120
happy so they want other people to feel

1303
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:49,440
that pain mm-hmm because they maybe they

1304
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,730
got called out for something so now

1305
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,070
they're like okay you know what you're

1306
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:55,770
coming yeah I'm gonna call out other

1307
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:57,330
people to make them worse I might just

1308
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,830
maybe be in my head I don't know that's

1309
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:01,290
a theory I have I mean you know it's

1310
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:03,750
it's so it's it's crazy that it's gotten

1311
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:06,300
to a point like that I just you know I

1312
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,810
just I just want I want to be a better

1313
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,090
person

1314
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:09,870
yeah and it's like if I want to be a

1315
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:13,500
better person

1316
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:16,140
then then let me make my mistakes you

1317
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,030
know and and I'm sure like eventually

1318
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:21,130
you know there's gonna be something that

1319
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,450
like happen in the past that like people

1320
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,250
are gonna be upset about you know it's

1321
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:27,460
and that's I mean I mean we all like

1322
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:29,710
Sade and do dumb things when we're young

1323
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,810
and growing yeah you know figuring it

1324
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:33,490
out well like the Indian thing like I

1325
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:34,720
just like I said I used to call Native

1326
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,830
American b-boy and I didn't know the

1327
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,060
difference I didn't know why that

1328
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,280
happened

1329
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,480
apparently it's because when people

1330
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,090
first came here they thought they were

1331
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,010
in India I know this is true yeah and

1332
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,630
then they just stopped just kept calling

1333
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:49,420
them Indians so I didn't know how

1334
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:51,480
offensive that was but when you when you

1335
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,830
watch cartoons and stuff I know you

1336
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,200
associate that's like I grew up learning

1337
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,190
from cartoons and stuff right in history

1338
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,360
class I mean I guess I didn't pay

1339
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,920
attention to well and then you know I

1340
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,870
mean and in cartoons they're playing

1341
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,550
cowboys and Indians yeah exactly

1342
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,900
actually you would let's it that because

1343
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:06,430
that just happened right Columbus Day

1344
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:10,630
it just happened did it recently I

1345
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:11,590
believe that I don't know yeah but a lot

1346
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:13,420
of people are talking about you know

1347
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:15,580
Columbus Day and or should it be called

1348
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:18,010
indigenous indigenous peoples day yeah

1349
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,390
changing it up cuz everyone likes there

1350
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,830
everyone's like yo Christopher Columbus

1351
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:23,980
shouldn't be celebrated anymore he did

1352
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:26,200
he didn't even really find America and

1353
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,300
he just really just kind of what he did

1354
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,120
to the people actually because uh you

1355
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:33,730
know he was like I'll trade like certain

1356
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,800
objects for land and the Native

1357
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:38,380
Americans were like you can't own land

1358
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,180
sure like this is a good idea for us and

1359
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,300
so when they got this up and then you

1360
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,250
know he started to enact oh we own this

1361
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:48,130
or we we do this and then Indian people

1362
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:50,080
or sorry Native American people see your

1363
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:52,780
cancelled bro a Native American people

1364
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,820
they they they taught him certain things

1365
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,980
how to do certain stuff and then what he

1366
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:58,300
did was enslave them you know and so a

1367
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,890
lot of people are like wait a minute

1368
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:02,980
this isn't right we've been celebrating

1369
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:05,530
somebody who has persecuted people who

1370
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,090
previously owned this land right so

1371
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:12,090
that's the whole contract I didn't know

1372
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:14,470
its own digitus people's day no way see

1373
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:19,150

00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,420
learn yeah exactly you have to learn at

1379
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,680
some point and there should be some not

1380
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,140

if someone's ignorant like you get angry

1387
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:51,299

1405
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,480
a couple of the bigger questions

1406
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,700
questions yeah I have like one or two

1407
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,589
sure mister um but actually one that I

1408
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:47,099
wanted to talk about is because you are

1409
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:49,319

1410
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:52,020
be in a long-distance relationship oh

1411
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:54,359
that has actually panned out yeah yeah

1412
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:55,859
so I don't know if you want to talk

1413
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,630
about it a little bit about this cuz you

1414
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:59,520
know especially again with social media

1415
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:01,770

1423
00:52:11,849 --> 00:52:15,390
completely different story so let's just

1424
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:17,819
hear about that a little yeah I mean um

1425
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:21,150
you know what I when I was younger I

1426
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:22,859
would have never said I would get into a

1427
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:24,900
long-distance relationship you know I

1428
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:27,990
used to be like you know what I couldn't

1429
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,849
do it I need like just to touch somebody

1430
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:34,430
you're horny we've got my one boy I was

1431
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:38,490
a horny boy yeah still am but when I met

1432
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:41,130
gia my my wife my current wife my only

1433
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:43,440
wife I remember thinking like if I don't

1434
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,710
at least try to make this work then I'm

1435
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,530
just

1436
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,700
regret it forever you know and and

1437
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:51,089
long-distance you know it's possible

1438
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:55,320
it's just it's not it's not easy and I

1439
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:58,619
think it takes very specific kinds of

1440
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:00,240
people for me like let's say I was with

1441
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:04,560
a long-distance relationship with my ex

1442
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:06,150
okay who at the time like needed to talk

1443
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:10,050
on the phone all the time needed to know

1444
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:12,540
where I was and and if I was trying to

1445
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:14,010
do that with her long-distance with her

1446
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:17,640
that would have never worked but with

1447
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:20,339
Chea not only is she a super secure

1448
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:23,460
person like isn't jealous isn't like

1449
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:25,589
where you add who you with she also was

1450
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,810
really busy you know I'm saying she ran

1451
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:31,230
her own business in Canada so it was

1452
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:33,599
like we both had our own stuff going on

1453
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:35,160
so it wasn't somebody or - yeah it's

1454
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,510
really important because if one person

1455
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,890
is busy all the time and they can't text

1456
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:40,349
back and they can't call back the other

1457
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,940
person is like what's happening you know

1458
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:44,099
their life kind of gets revolved around

1459
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,960
the other person and like and and that's

1460
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:47,970
not good for even a regular relationship

1461
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,300
you know and so what worked for us is

1462
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,560
like she could worry about her own thing

1463
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,140
I could worry about my own thing we were

1464
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,240
both super secure people no one was like

1465
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,339
tripping about like why aren't you

1466
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,500
hitting me back you know and and and

1467
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:03,030
also and this is a big thing in longest

1468
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:07,080
relationships ooh is that like um we

1469
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:09,420
both had money yeah we could both afford

1470
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,880
to fly back and forth to Canada when we

1471
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,619
needed to and she also she ran her own

1472
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,930
business so she could leave whenever she

1473
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:17,700
wanted to that is huge yeah dude so it

1474
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:18,900
wasn't like you know cuz some people are

1475
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,940
in long dissipation ships they can't

1476
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,030
take the time off of work for like six

1477
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:26,130
months right but we were we had a system

1478
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:27,630
where we would work work work for three

1479
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,460
weeks I would shoot I'll go on meetings

1480
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:30,720
she would do all like her appointments

1481
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,060
for three weeks she was an aesthetician

1482
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,740
pedicures manicures waxing vaginas we do

1483
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,510
that for three weeks straight we'd set

1484
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,520
one week where I wouldn't take any

1485
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:40,440
business and she wouldn't take any

1486
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,150
clients we'd fly to each other and hang

1487
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,089
out for a week and then be like alright

1488
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:46,859
see you next month you know and um it

1489
00:54:45,089 --> 00:54:48,359
was hard at first first couple months it

1490
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:51,270
was like you know crying at the airport

1491
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:53,490
and [ __ ] like that but after after a few

1492
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,720
months I was like alright well uh see

1493
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:57,630
you next month

1494
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,519
you know have have a good trip and um

1495
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:01,230
just coming out used to it how long ago

1496
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:03,930
did you get married a year ago

1497
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,859
oh so it's oh that that's way more

1498
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:08,250
recent than I thought

1499
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:10,109
is uh so that's that's during a time

1500
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,720
where immigration is a big thing is she

1501
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:17,579
is US citizen now dude that whole

1502
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:19,529
process was a [ __ ] it's booked for ever

1503
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:21,660
I would assume right now in like the

1504
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:23,160
past four years three years she

1505
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,170
literally just got her green card like

1506
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:29,490
two weeks ago oh really and it was over

1507
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:32,190
a year no dude not only that yeah I'm

1508
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:35,309
talking about from the beginning process

1509
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:38,309
of trying to get her k1 visa which was

1510
00:55:35,309 --> 00:55:41,250
the proper visa to get to get married

1511
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:43,079
it's the fiance visa where she enters

1512
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,400
the country and has 90 days to marry me

1513
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:47,190
legally this is all we're doing

1514
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,470
everything the super proper way from the

1515
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:52,140
day we applied for that visa to the day

1516
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:54,180
we got it it got married and since she

1517
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,740
got married like we've done a couple we

1518
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,450
she did an interview I did an interview

1519
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:00,900
the whole approval process took like two

1520
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:02,369
years yeah that is crazy yeah and and

1521
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,200
and here's what happened to while she

1522
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:05,460
was married while after we got married

1523
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,109
she wasn't allowed to leave the country

1524
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,420
or work she couldn't even go back to

1525
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:10,920
Canada for like a straight year yeah she

1526
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,619
could even visit her family it was crazy

1527
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,809
yeah that seems I mean that I guess in a

1528
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:17,069
way that shows true love because if you

1529
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:18,450
guys really didn't love each other you

1530
00:56:17,069 --> 00:56:22,339
wouldn't go through that [ __ ] you

1531
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:24,509
know it was like and he was 22 his is um

1532
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:26,579
you know when we kind of got into our

1533
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:29,460
long-distance routine at one point I was

1534
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:30,599
like hey babe is this weird but do you

1535
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,039
almost think it's better that we're

1536
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:33,500
long-distance and she was like babe I

1537
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:37,230
was thinking the exact same thing

1538
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:39,269
because she loves her alone time I love

1539
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:41,279
my alone time she was working so hard

1540
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:42,509
and it was like dude who I don't even

1541
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:45,299
think we would have had time for a

1542
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:47,039
relationship if we were together like

1543
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:50,309
that so how was it different now then

1544
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:54,059
well now we've taken all those skills

1545
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:56,849
and apply them to living together you

1546
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:59,519
know because like now that we've gone

1547
00:56:56,849 --> 00:57:01,980
through all that nobody's mad when

1548
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,720
someone's like just in the other room

1549
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,029
for like the whole thing like we can be

1550
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,260
yeah we can be chillin not even talking

1551
00:57:06,029 --> 00:57:08,870
to each other and

1552
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:12,390
it's not an issue you know no one's like

1553
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:13,830
needy yeah you know and being to people

1554
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:15,300
that really value they're kind of like

1555
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:17,130
space and a lone time I think the

1556
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,990
distance helped us get into a space

1557
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:20,820
where it's like okay I understand that

1558
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:23,010
this is you need to be here I need to be

1559
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,690
here sometimes if I'm snoring too much I

1560
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:26,820
will move to the next bed because she's

1561
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,620
like pushing me my face cuz she can't

1562
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,120
sleep that's something she had to get

1563
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:34,260
used to like me snoring apparently I

1564
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:36,510
snore and but yeah it worked we got

1565
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,090
married yeah that's not good

1566
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:40,770
thanks not bad and I guess we can

1567
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:44,970
continue into another question from

1568
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:46,890
Caesar that ass what do you believe to

1569
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,750
be the key to happiness cuz you're

1570
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:50,490
somebody who always promotes that type

1571
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,660
of stuff I know there's a lot of Keys

1572
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:54,180
you have you have more keys than a

1573
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,980
janitor more keys than I have two keys I

1574
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:58,500
have two key or that I try to apply to

1575
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:01,200
my life all the time one being like I

1576
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:05,330
said before the more you care about what

1577
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:08,850
other people think I think the more you

1578
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:11,970
/ the more you like cut yourself off

1579
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:13,410
from like potential happiness you know

1580
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:15,480
cuz you're you're leaving your life

1581
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:17,700
according to other people's opinions

1582
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,530
like you give them the power instead of

1583
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,060
having own power exactly like once you

1584
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:24,030
stop caring then it's like you're free

1585
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:25,140
you know it's like who cares the second

1586
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:27,180
thing I always try to apply in my life

1587
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:29,400
is something I learned in like a Taoism

1588
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,480
class in college which but but then

1589
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,980
people like so many people have said

1590
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,770
this in so many different ways and it's

1591
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,180
that um life isn't about what happens to

1592
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:37,620
you it's about how you react to what

1593
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,120
happens to you you know it's like once

1594
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:41,280
you realize that you don't control

1595
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,330
anything and you stop worrying about it

1596
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,780
and you're just kind of like okay I'm

1597
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:49,140
just gonna make the most out of whatever

1598
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:51,240
situations I'm dealt then it's like okay

1599
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:53,130

concise stuff

1604
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:05,640
this table is of Will Smith he thinks to

1605
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,130
not let things happen to you but you

1606
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,690
control the universe is that he says

1607
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:11,610
something like that like you can make

1608
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:12,690
force to universe to Ben there's a lot

1609
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:15,000
of people yeah who believe like

1610
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:17,430
manifesting disks it's a similar thing

1611
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,660
no I mean I'm here's the thing I mean I

1612
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:22,510
totally believe in the universe too

1613
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:24,610
like okay like it exists oh yeah it's

1614
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:25,540
all exist but when people used to ask me

1615
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:26,860
what I wanted to be when I grow up

1616
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,310
whenever they asked me what did you

1617
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,930
think

1618
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:30,640
did you ever think you would end up here

1619
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:32,200
now I'm like yeah this is what I wanted

1620
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,460
to do like I didn't know in what

1621
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,360
capacity but one night when they asked

1622
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:37,000
me I was little I'd say oh yeah I'm

1623
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:40,150
gonna be famous cuz I knew what I wanted

1624
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,880
to do and I knew that if I kept working

1625
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:44,530
towards that goal I would make it happen

1626
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,640
you know and whenever people asked me

1627
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,780
like how does it feel to like live your

1628
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,190
dream I always tell them like well

1629
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:50,140
here's the thing I never looked at it

1630
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:51,340
okay here's here's another here's I've

1631
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:53,440
said this a million times in my videos

1632
00:59:51,340 --> 01:00:03,070
but but this is Ryan Higa the audience

1633
00:59:53,440 --> 01:00:06,610
so I always say hey what do I say don't

1634
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:09,400
look at your goals as dreams look at

1635
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:11,050
them as destinations okay because for me

1636
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,840
when you think of dreams you think of

1637
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:16,240
like like unicorns something that's like

1638
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,610
that's not tangible you know but if you

1639
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:21,610
look at your goal as something that that

1640
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:23,500
is there as a destination and all you

1641
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:25,090
have to do is keep moving towards it

1642
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,670
then you'll get there eventually you

1643
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:29,470
know and and I feel like I looked at

1644
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:30,490
like being famous the same way somebody

1645
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:32,410
would look at getting like a college

1646
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:34,090
degree or getting like a becoming a

1647
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:37,420
doctor you know like you know what the

1648
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:40,540
end goal is so you go okay I'm gonna go

1649
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:41,890
take biology class and go be pre-med I'm

1650
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,210
gonna be a nurse I'm gonna take all

1651
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:44,830
these steps that eventually make me a

1652
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:47,470
doctor so for me I was like I know where

1653
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:50,980
I want to be in my career I'm gonna take

1654
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:54,790
the necessary steps and you know get an

1655
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:57,580
agent and go take acting classes and and

1656
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:59,890

1657
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:01,180
put myself in the right positions and

1658
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:03,310
