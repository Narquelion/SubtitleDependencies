4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,550
know me personally in real life you

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,710
would probably know by now that one of

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,870
my biggest weaknesses in life is that

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:35,170

[Laughter]

10
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,250
Yesi most of those dance moves were for

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,020
jokes but that's actually me trying

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,180
especially the top Raving remember that

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,920
thing but dancing without moving now

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,960
that that kind of sounds like the dance

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,770
that I would be good at but I might need

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,770
a little help
