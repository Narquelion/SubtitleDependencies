1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
hey guys so I don't know if you guys can

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,500
tell her not but my voice is gonna be a

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,779
little bit more annoying than usual

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,219
because I'm sick in fact I've been sick

5
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,570
for a while now with be okay that the

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,980
illness has been gone for a while now

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,929
but really though I have been sick for

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,410
like two or three weeks so I apologize

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,789
for my voice and also my my hair which I

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,590
did not cut I don't know why I never

11
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,119
remember to cut my hair before I vlog I

12
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,099
know so many of you wonderful people

13
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,660
loved to point out how ugly my hair gets

14
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,550
minutes long but being the extremely

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,019
self confident person that I am it's a

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:37,980
good thing I don't care what you guys

17
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:39,329
think about my iboga oh now that works

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,040
what you love those days when you have

19
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,480
magical sneezes anyway I'm pretty sure

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,250
you guys know what memes are and one of

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,690
my favorite means is the unpopular

22
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,129
opinion meme you know the one where

23
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,450
people write their opinion on something

24
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,829
that most people don't agree with either

25
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,270
that or they agree with it and they're

26
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,590
too scared to say it out loud why did

27
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,140
you guys know I'm always gonna give you

28
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,789
guys my honest opinion as unpopular as

29
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,070
it may be I mean it does get me into

30
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,570
trouble sometimes but this isn't TV you

31
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,129
can't tell me what to say can't tell me

32
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,570
what the thing this is YouTube I can say

33
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,000
whatever I won this is the land of the

34
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,200
free in the home of the bees what yep

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,850
definitely have to pill today anyway

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,530
today's topic can be another touchy one

37
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,060
cyberbullying if you watch my draw my

38
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,650
life video you know that I was bullied a

39
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,240
lot when I was younger so of course I

40
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,770
think bullying is a problem but recently

41
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,630
it seems like cyber bullying is like the

42
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,400
main topic that people report on these

43
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,170
days you know from articles to new

44
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
stations to groups being started on

45
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,380
Facebook just to target cyber bullying

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,210
well I'm just gonna come out and say it

47
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,369
this is my unpopular opinion for the day

48
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,020
cyber bullying is a first-world problem

49
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,700
there I said it now bring on the hate

50
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,200
comments not just kidding don't cuz that

51
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,850
would be cyberbullying look don't get me

52
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,140
wrong I do believe that cyberbullying is

53
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,210
a problem but don't you think we should

54
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,619
be more focused on regular bullying

55
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,299
that's done in person coming from

56
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,649
somebody who was bullied in real life I

57
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,119
don't think it's really bullying if you

58
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,770
can escape it and I was being bullied in

59
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,240
school there was no escape I felt like I

60
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,890
was being backed into a corner to the

61
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,329
point where I wanted to kill myself cuz

62
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,159
I thought I had no other option I was

63
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,540
forced to be there with him I was forced

64
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,159
to go to school I was forced to go to

65
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,540
classes with them if I had the choice I

66
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,829
would have avoided them at all cost if

67
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,909
you're being cyber bullied whether it's

68
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,009
on Facebook or Twitter or whatever

69
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,450
social media you are not being backed

70
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,979
into a corner you have so many options

71
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,329
you have the option to unfriend your

72
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,860
boys you have the option to block your

73
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,270
bullies you have the option to escape

74
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,129
your bullies by deleting your entire

75
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,010
account you are not being forced to be

76
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,330
there having social

77
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,799
Media is not something you need to live

78
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,459
and there's no law saying that you have

79
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:17,260
to be on it

80
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:18,640
unlike school that's your own choice I

81
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,989
believe that if you're gonna choose to

82
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,220
be on social media you're gonna have to

83
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:22,720
learn how to deal with it if you can't

84
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,950
handle it then just don't be on it

85
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,120
there's no shame in that because no

86
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,829
matter how much people try to stop

87
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,110
bullying through empathetic news stories

88
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:30,640
or campaigns I honestly believe that

89
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,360
bullying especially cyberbullying is

90
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,739
never gonna stop

91
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,390
that's just how some people are and also

92
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,280
on a side note all those stop bullying

93
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,379
campaigns where all people do is hashtag

94
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,700
stop bullying does almost nothing in my

95
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,989
opinion I'm pretty sure there aren't any

96
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,810
bullies that looks at a tweet with

97
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:46,030
hashtag stop bullying and things oh okay

98
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,620
yeah stop and for all the kids that are

99
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,940
being bullied that do see that hashtag

100
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,220
I'm pretty sure they're not gonna be

101
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,810
thinking huh that'll stop them instead

102
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,040
of campaigning to try and stop bullying

103
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,540
I think there should be more campaigns

104
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,769
trying to teach kids how to deal with

105
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,599
bullying I'm sure at the time I would

106
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:00,819
appreciate that a lot more hashtag

107
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,690
bullying isn't going away so let's teach

108
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:06,370
the kids how to deal with bullying and

109
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,079
other stuff yeah that's pretty catchy

110
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,340
that'll catch on I can honestly say to

111
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,599
all you kids out there that are being

112
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,950
bullied right now if you can survive

113
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,480
being bullied it's gonna make you a

114
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,879
stronger person when you get older not

115
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,530
older older well I guess older too I

116
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,629
think the real way people are not aggro

117
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,829
is either inspiration or desperation and

118
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:22,329
if you're being bullied to the point of

119
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,680
desperation where you feel like you have

120
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,629
no options you're gonna figure out

121
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,069
something a little off topic but other

122
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:28,660
than mentioning it and might draw my

123
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:30,669
life video I never really told my story

124
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,900
in detail publicly before being bullied

125
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,160
is not something you're typically proud

126
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,449
of kind of want to just erase those

127
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,340
years I don't know the next time I'm

128
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,379
gonna be talking about bullying so here

129
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,180
is my story cue emotional music and I

130
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,319
was little boy I never thought I'd make

131
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,790
it out okay that's a little too dramatic

132
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,500
let's tone it down so when I was going

133
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,760
into sixth grade I moved to a charter

134
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,199
school where I basically didn't know

135
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,060
anyone and I already stood out because I

136
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,799
was really really short and skinny at

137
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,269
the time and there was also not many

138
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,709
Asians there and blessed because it was

139
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,239
a charter school we all took a placement

140
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,620
test to see which group we would be in

141
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,150
and to this day I still don't know how

142
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,340
but I scored really well on that test

143
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,139
and they put me with the older kids so I

144
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,790
was even smaller in comparison to and

145
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,109
from there it was pretty much like I was

146
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,370
in a movie in terms of getting bullied

147
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,629
things that I saw in movies that I

148
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,400
thought never happened in real life

149
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:11,079
happened to me I mean it wasn't anything

150
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,940
crazy but I would get shoved pushed to

151
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,769
the ground praying tea made fun of her

152
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,269
being small and Asian this went on

153
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,919
pretty much every single day I used to

154
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,419
make all these random excuses to my mom

155
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,010
why I couldn't go to school until I

156
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,270
finally told her why and remember she

157
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,919
called the principal one night and the

158
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,510
next day we all had this big assembly to

159
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,010
talk about how we shouldn't be bullying

160
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,780
mother and that pretty much did nothing

161
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,220
and at the time I just hated like I used

162
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,230
to stay up every single night feeling

163
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,850
angry and sorry for myself sometimes I'd

164
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,290
be so frustrated that I have thoughts of

165
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,550
just bringing my metal back to school

166
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,530
just start swinging away at these

167
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,850
bullies but then I come to my senses and

168
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,620
realize that I don't want to go to jail

169
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,870
I'd rather be dead than go to jail which

170
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,460
actually led to even darker thoughts but

171
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,750
luckily I'd fall asleep and in the

172
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,100
morning be somewhat grateful that I

173
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,690
didn't do it but then I remember one

174
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,150
specific night I was just sick of

175
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,170
feeling angry and sorry for myself and I

176
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,730
started to think in a different way

177
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,290
sorry I chose to think in a different

178
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,850
way I remember thinking to myself that

179
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,440
everything happens for a reason I'm

180
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,480
being bullied for a reason my bullies

181
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,160
are bullying me for a reason and I just

182
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,140
asked myself why and I came to realize

183
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,580
that everything they did was just to

184
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,020
make each other laugh and I was just the

185
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,430
easiest target so then I thought how can

186
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,750
I take that away from them and once I

187
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,580
started thinking like that I changed my

188
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,050
entire outlook on the situation I made

189
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,670
everything a challenge no matter how

190
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,170
much someone was gonna prank me or do

191
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,460
stuff to me to make each other laugh I

192
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,840
was gonna make them laugh if one of the

193
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,280
bullies made fun of me I would go with

194
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,570
it and make their joke my joke like if

195
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,430
one of them said why don't you open your

196
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,810
eyes you little chink I would say what

197
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,920
do you mean chink I know understand and

198
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,330
then everyone laughed because they

199
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,770
weren't expecting me to say anything and

200
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,210
just like that it was my joke and then

201
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,530
if I got tripped or shoved to the ground

202
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,670
I'd make a joke out of it I remember

203
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,230
this one time one of the guys were

204
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,760
behind me and they did that thing where

205
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,070
you take a step and they kick your back

206
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,840
leg trip and fall down and I did and

207
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,430
basically he said move it jab and I

208
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,990
would just be like man Richard that was

209
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,600
a good one you're so strong

210
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,190
shut up okay I don't know I didn't seem

211
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,570
like I want that time but then I just

212
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,770
kept doing it over and over and

213
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,060
eventually it stopped

214
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,920
I took the fun out of it I didn't get

215
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,300
mad I didn't retaliate I just made it a

216
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,620
joke like I wanted to fall down and

217
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,270
instead of being known as the small

218
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,950
nerdy Asian kid I was known as the small

219
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,840
nerdy Asian kid that was sometimes funny

220
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,430
nobody wants to bully the small nerdy

221
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,780
Asian kid that's sometimes funny because

222
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,170
that's just me but that's basically my

223
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,260
story

224
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,520
cool story broke thank you that's what

225
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,440
it would sound like if you were here I

226
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,850
started using comedy as a defense and

227
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,620
then I just fell in love with making

228
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,540
people laugh which led to me making

229
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,950
videos and now I'm here talking to you

230
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,300
guys and for all of you out there that

231
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,440
are going for the same thing it doesn't

232
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,670
mean that if you do what I did it's

233
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,500
gonna work for you you have to figure

234
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,820
out your own situation the point is for

235
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,350
all of you out there who feel like

236
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,150
you're being back into a corner and you

237
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,410
have no other options just remember and

238
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,090
know that you're not going to be there

239
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,650
forever and if you manage to survive it

240
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,300
it's gonna make you a stronger and

241
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,590
smarter person when you get older I

242
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,940
don't know it based on a little messed

243
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,920
up

244
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,810
and another unpopular opinion by being

245
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,430
bullied is kind of a blessing in a

246
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,570
really really good disguise because if

247
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,250
you get to that point of desperation

248
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,780
where you're backed into a corner and

249
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,430
you feel like you have no options and

250
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,840
you still survive it at least for me you

251
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,520
live with this thought that there's

252
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,470
nothing that you can't do because you've

253
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,000
been in a situation with no options and

254
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,010
you still made it I can honestly say

255
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,780
that looking back I'm almost thankful to

256
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,010
my bullies because without them I

257
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,780
probably wouldn't be talking to you guys

258
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,220
right now in fact if you happen to be

259
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,140
watching this video for some reason you

260
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,360
know exactly what you are I forgive you

261
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,780
for everything I wouldn't be Who I am or

262
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,340
where I am today without you so in a way

263
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,140
thank you

264
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,520
whoa when super off-topic on this one

265
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,930
sorry I get really passionate when I

266
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,250
talk about bullying but anyway thank you

267
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,480
guys so much for watching I know this

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,500
wasn't the funniest video but it's

269
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,790
something I've always wanted to talk

270
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,860
about remember to post the hashtag

271
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,590
bullying isn't going away so let's teach

272
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,790
kids how to deal with them and stuff I

273
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,680
don't think that was it and also

274
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,430
remember if you're being booked if

275
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,880
