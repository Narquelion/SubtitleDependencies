4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,400
guys if you didn't catch the last video

5
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,019
I'm currently in the middle of a move

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,210
right now I apologize this room is

7
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,559
incredibly at least temporary I swear I

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,179
should be moving soon but anyway over

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,430
the past few years I've always gotten a

10
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,289
bunch of comments asking me how are HPC

11
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,670
or the Ryan Higa production company came

12
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:27,529
to be you know these guys

13
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,529

14
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,640
wait we're doing mine now what where's

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,290
my fries you have to let me know so I

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,290
can at least look and get a free spring

17
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,660
and I guess what I really think about it

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,250
I never did introduce who rhpc was or

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,840
when they join it kind of just started

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,160
showing up in videos now and then and

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,720
then eventually all the time you guys

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,699
kind of just figured out who was who

23
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,100
what today it's all gonna change because

24
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:55,020
for the very first time in our HPC

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,750
history for the very first time I

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,670

rhpc squad came to be I don't know why I

30
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,650
did it

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,100

51
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,430
another city

52
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,709
the infamous city known as no sandy

53
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,520

56
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,790
when I first arrived everyone seemed

57
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:32,890
nice and pleasant and all of them were

58
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,230
beautiful little did I know these were

59
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:40,690
some of the best actors and imposters in

60
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:42,940
the world luckily for me I had found my

61
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,190

62
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,620

have gout ate too much oysters as a kid

66
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,510

67
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,550
body oh okay

68
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,060

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,060
the sea

70
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,300
after a couple years battling off the

71
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,280
imposters I knew we couldn't keep up

72
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,860
this pace it was time to go back to

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,750
Vegas

74
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,610
they got us completely surrounded great

75
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,380
to the drop of smoke after that and we

76
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,480
all head northeast for the desert smoke

77
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,250

78
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,860

the academy in the city of roses he

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,510

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,960
unpredictable a wild card I believe the

96
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,000
first time we met we asked him to take

97
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:12,610
us to a shop for some food and beverage

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,680

99
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,020
why Derek brought us here but we're sure

100
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,300
