so today I'm going to be talking about

9
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:17,640
something I really don't like that's

10
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:29,730
right nosy people what no intro for this

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:31,080
one guess not so one day I was pretty no

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:38,190
because nobody wants to live in a world

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:39,510
without cookies so that was rude anyway

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,770
so like I said earlier I'm gonna be

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,710
talking about nosy people and that

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,559
really irritates me but the nosy people

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,059
irritate me not that talking about it so

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,440
like any other average day I was in my

19
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,230
room talking to myself when all of a

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,670

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,240

25
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,500
how irritating nosy people are you know

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,640
what people I'm talking about right it's

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,840
those people that you weren't even

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,100
talking to you but they try to sneak

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,119
into your conversation because they

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,260
think that they know that they know what

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,250
you're talking about when actually they

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,630
know that we know that they know that

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,030
they don't know what we're talking about

34
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,140
you know you know what it might be

35
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,390

59
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:25,810

how nosy the world can be but let me

62
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,900
tell you the nosiest of all people have

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,700
got to be parents what time you're gonna

64
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,319
be hard going did you take out the trash

65
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,639
why didn't you take it I was the capital

66
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,260
of Thailand it's just far with your

67
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,629
daddy and my favorite question of all

68
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,459
how was your day you want to know how my

69
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:46,989
day was you want to know how my day was

70
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,219
it was alright but seriously of all you

71
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,389
nosy people out there I hope you know

72
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,560
that we know that you don't know what we

73
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:51,790
know so stop pretending like you know

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,959
even though you don't because every time

75
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,799
you returned to know what you know even

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,969
though you don't know what you know

77
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,199
you're just lessening the value of

78
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:57,340
knowing and if you keep lessening the

79
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,629
value of knowing then pretty soon we're

80
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,889
not gonna have no no and if we have no

81
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:01,750
know that Harvey suppose to know when no

82
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:04,709
means no you know what I'm getting at no

83
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,709
exactly
