1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
hey guys so it is the first video of the

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,730
year and it and it's two weeks into the

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,189
year so we're already behind schedule

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,080
sorry guys I was in Hawaii and hence the

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,830
long hair I don't know what that has to

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,420
do with Hawaii

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,710
I don't know Hawaii back to the topic so

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,389
it's about two weeks into the new year

9
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,379
and it's right about that time or half

10
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,910
the people who made New Year's

11
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,830
resolutions have already given up the

12
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,420
other half are about to give up and of

13
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,880
course is the half that you know never

14
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,410
made resolutions plus the half of people

15
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,539
that actually keep their resolutions

16
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,099
that's four halves not starting off

17
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,449
strong right but anyway I don't know

18
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,710
about you guys but I always make new

19
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,239
year's resolutions and to be completely

20
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,440
honest I don't think I've ever kept one

21
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,850
throughout the entire year I mean last

22
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,410
year my resolution was to stop drinking

23
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,120
energy drinks and if you guys watch the

24
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,290
behind the scenes you know that I didn't

25
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,550
even come close and after really

26
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,770
thinking about it and questioning why I

27
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,120
always fill my New Year's resolutions I

28
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,070
think I figured it out I always start

29
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,050
the year off strong but then over time I

30
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,969
slowly start biessing myself and

31
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,440
convincing myself that I'm not cheating

32
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,730
on my goals but I am it sounds confusing

33
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,899
let me just show you here's at the

34
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,390
beginning of last year kind of look like

35
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,280
for me this ain't so bad I feel like I

36
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,710
energy drink which tonight do have to

37
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,539
work today so maybe just one for

38
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,400
emergencies push to mean last year I was

39
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,409
drinking five a day so two a day is

40
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,180
still improvement last time I checked

41
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,159
three is still less than five so was

42
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,860
four five would be a tie with last

43
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,170
year's so I probably shouldn't but then

44
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,640
again a tie does hang from a neck and

45
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,740
the neck is connected to the head so

46
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,869
this area could be called the NED or the

47
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,680
heck is going on with the heck but this

48
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,909
year nope

49
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,290
this year's gonna be different I'm not

50
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,490
gonna be asked myself this year and to

51
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,759
be sure of that I'm gonna hold myself

52
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,680
accountable with me here's your list of

53
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,420
resolutions eat healthier go offend

54
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,400
people and no more cursing fart jokes

55
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,049
dark jokes bad puns dad's and Red Bull

56
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,460
actually that should say energy drinks

57
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,390
not really that's probably another thing

58
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,340
you should stop doing you're always

59
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,490
promoting random brands for free alright

60
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,509
add it to the list then okay see once

61
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,189
you have your resolutions all you have

62
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,479
to do is not BS yourself or yourself a

63
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,159
carnival and just stick with it

64
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,479
especially because right now two weeks

65
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,710
into the new year that's when everybody

66
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,990
gives up on their goals like that's

67
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,490
statistically proven when people don't

68
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,960
fact-check me because I made that up but

69
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,979
you get the point here's some examples

70
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,659
of some types of people that you don't

71
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,340
want to be two weeks into the new year

72
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,049
starting with the New Year's

73
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,490
person we have all seen it before and

74
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,869
I'm not gonna lie I've been guilty of it

75
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,979
too the new year's high person is

76
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,569
exactly what it sounds like it's

77
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,830
somebody who's overly hyped for the new

78
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,819
year they're so sick of what happened in

79
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,650
the previous year that they're ready to

80
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,390
move on they spend so much time telling

81
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,650
other people and themselves how great

82
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,970
this new year is gonna be and how it's

83
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,500
nothing compared to the last year that

84
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,760
they actually don't make any changes at

85
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,069
all you've seen them before they all say

86
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,629
the same old common basic bit huh

87
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:29,640
what cursing remember right they say all

88
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:32,519
the same old common basic types of

89
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,310
things such as I am so ready for 2017

90
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,220
but it's 2017 ready for me don't live in

91
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,980
the past live in the now hashtag 2017

92
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,940
hashtag ready man I'm so ready for 2017

93
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,230
I'm ready to put it work

94
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,329
what no this shouldn't count I was just

95
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,920
acting as someone else you still cursed

96
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:51,900
I didn't know what content in my videos

97
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,329
to do or not okay well I didn't know

98
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,910
that see so can I just start over fine

99
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,680
but no more chances after that the

100
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,239
technicality cheater basically this is a

101
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,560
guy who cheats on the resolution by a

102
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,660
technicality like I mentioned earlier

103
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,010
people who PS themselves something I am

104
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,359
guilty of actually I'm probably guilty

105
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,040
of everything you guys see here because

106
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:09,900
I if not I wouldn't have thought of it I

107
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,260
wrote this thinking about myself in the

108
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,639
past

109
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,350
yeah I'm annoying but anyway this is a

110
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,970
guy who PS is himself into thinking that

111
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,620
he's not cheating on his goals when he

112
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,489
really is basically they're cheating so

113
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,190
it defeats the whole purpose

114
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:25,470
looks something like this one drink a

115
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:36,599
day I'm just gonna have one a day I'm

116
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:38,130
just gonna have one slice what what that

117
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,010
was just for the skit I didn't even need

118
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,299
it right I'm you okay I see all the

119
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:49,530
behind the scenes - you can't hide

120
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:51,000
things from me the unrealistic goals

121
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,290
person I know this is gonna sound like

122
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,370
the opposite of every inspirational

123
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,840
speaker sometimes I don't think it's

124
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,310
good to set your goals too high at least

125
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,630
right away especially for one year if

126
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,730
you set your goal too high and you don't

127
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,079
see any progress like it's unmotivated

128
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,459
this is actually another big part of not

129
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,440
being yourself you have to be realistic

130
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,450
yep this is gonna be the year is the

131
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,500
year I become a billionaire nice man I

132
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,170
mean you could do it if you really

133
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,030
believed

134
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,860
and I'm gonna practice basketball every

135
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,290
single day and finally make an NBA team

136
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,030
an go for us I'm gonna travel the entire

137
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,510
world and go to every single country who

138
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,590
it man

139
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,940
we're ruled you know what this is

140
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:25,900
finally gonna be the year that I get a

141
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:27,010
girlfriend the way to easy goals person

142
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,510
pretty much the opposite of the

143
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,160
unrealistic goals person this guy who

144
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,480
sets there goes way too easy to the

145
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,960
point where it's like why do you even

146
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,120
have that goal I need to stop using vine

147
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,320
the person in denial probably all know

148
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,460
at least one of these people this is the

149
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
person that makes resolutions about

150
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:46,990
everything other than the actual obvious

151
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:58,300
problem that they have no more I feel

152
00:04:46,990 --> 00:05:01,419
better already the person from China is

153
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,480
not even New Year's yet so she's on my

154
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:07,660
way she Bushido dance reproof and she uh

155
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,190
yeah the reset button person button

156
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,840
button I don't know why people think I

157
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,400
say that weird button how are you

158
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,540
supposed to set button button there's

159
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,890
two teas you gotta say one of them

160
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,479
button this is the guy who thinks that

161
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,100
just because it's a new year it's a

162
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,600
reset button on everything that happened

163
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:25,120
in the past year hey man I know we

164
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,890
haven't talked in a while but there's

165
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,729
figure since is a new year maybe we

166
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,680
could just start over

167
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:31,210
you know I mean I'm willing to put

168
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,030
everything that happened between us

169
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:37,310
behind me if you are so what do you say

170
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,960
you stole my wallet made out with cat

171
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,060
warriors still dating and you ran over

172
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,940
my grandmother with your car

173
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,010
yes and as bad as those things were you

174
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,530
know I am still willing to put it all

175
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:54,680
behind me wait is that my wallet is that

176
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:59,570
you cat wait Oh see it's all behind me

177
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,280
now you're feeling two of them now the

178
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,330
pun wasn't even that bad and how was

179
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,830
this a dark joke who killed her

180
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,720
grandmother and you threw her ashes on

181
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,790
the ground yes yes okay I see your point

182
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,500
but the pun wasn't that bad really was

183
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,940
though and that's your opinion my

184
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,810
opinion was that it's fine we're the

185
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,190
same person

186
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,490
fine then let's ask somebody else then

187
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,930
was the pun that bad it's not see it

188
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,220
come on you can't take the pun go away

189
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,360

190
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,500
on that one fine

191
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,620
would you still lose the dark jokes

192
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,640
resolution deal the secretive person now

193
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,170
these are for people who have

194
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,460
resolutions that they don't want to tell

195
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,750
anyone about because it's probably

196
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,860
embarrassing and these are the hardest

197
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:38,180
resolutions to keep because they're

198
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:41,200

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:22,090
lot about moisturizing lotion yeah I

210
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:23,949

211
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,660
what I give up wait what it's only been

212
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:27,520
one day and I've already like ruined all

213
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,139

214
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,789
mean you still have no cursing no red

215
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,660
bow no fart jokes surprisingly I

216
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:33,340
actually thought that was gonna be the

217
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,349
first one to go and the most important

218
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,030
one of all don't BS yourself remember

219
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:38,050
and if you ask me I actually think

220
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,910
you're doing a really good job with that

221
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,470
one I mean you didn't lie to yourself

222
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,120
when you failed you accepted it and now

223
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,039
you can learn from your failures and

224
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,900
improve yeah yeah you know what you're

225
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,430
right it doesn't matter if you fail your

226
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,660
resolutions as long as you don't BS

227
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,310
yourself actually I don't even need to

228
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,430
say BS anymore I'm just gonna say it

229
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,660
don't push yourself oh wow okay I think

230
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,190
you're kind of missing the point

231
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,289
oh but I'm a furnace matter that I fail

232
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,330
all my resolutions in fact I should fail

233
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,280
them so that I can improve no you

234
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,570
shouldn't try to fill them I think no

235
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,000
you know what you're right I need to

236
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,860
stop both myself and just be me someone

237
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,720
that makes bad puns and fart jokes and

238
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,909
and kills grandmothers and throws their

239
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,710
ashes on the ground well just being

240
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,720
honest with yourself and acknowledging

241
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,970
your flaws and your fails are really the

242
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,340
only way anyone can actually improve oh

243
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,800
I guess that last part was kind accurate

244
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,199
either that or you could also improve

245
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,340
yourself with a nice coat of icing sugar

246
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,340
