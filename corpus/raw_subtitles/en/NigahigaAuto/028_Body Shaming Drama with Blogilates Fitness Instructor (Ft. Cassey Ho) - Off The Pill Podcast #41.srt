1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,870
the body positive movement has evolved

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,850
so much over the past several years that

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,500
now if somebody wants to lose weight or

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,990
lose fat all of a sudden you are an

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,340
antibody positive and you get kicked out

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,200
of the community the great thing about

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,200

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,600
telling them earlier I don't know why

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,890
but for the longest time this doesn't

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,309
make any sense I don't know why I bring

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,710
it up

19
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:56,070
I thought your YouTube I called you bio

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:01:03,840
gates bio gates I thought for the

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:05,489
longest don't know why okay that makes

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,830
more sense because it looks like that I

23
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,830
it's like a little bio Games is like a

24
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,700
little like bio hacker II don't know I

25
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,140
just wasn't reading I just don't read so

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,590

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,439
probably if not the biggest Fitness

28
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:28,140
youtuber or blogger or youtuber you are

29
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:32,250
the biggest Fitness youtuber right right

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,540
and primarily I mean you do you do kind

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,909
of like vlog stuff it's not just being

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,439
an instructor right started out with

33
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,119
instructor and then people wanted to

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,430
know what oh well what do you eat what

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,590
do you do and so it got which is better

36
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,390
cuz they care about you more right yes

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,399
sometimes it's not just you yelling at

38
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,439
them no but sometimes they care too much

39
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:54,750
what does that mean you know I don't it

40
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,189
means it means that you you feel

41
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,469
obligated to know everything that's

42
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,020
going on in your life and they feel like

43
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,159
they have control over what you do and

44
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,659
if you don't do something that's

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,909
quote-unquote on-brand

46
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,799
and all of a sudden you're wrong and

47
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,280
you're a bad person and all this kind of

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:15,020
stuff I sense some tension there

49
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,849
I feel like is I mean something on your

50
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,370

51
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,110

55
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:31,010
is caught off the pill because it's

56
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,970
pretty much off the adderall at off the

57
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,410
Ritalin

58
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,150

59
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,560
everywhere so wherever we want to go and

60
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,340
we're gonna start right there so just

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,599
get right to it

62
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:44,900
no calisthenics we're going straight in

63
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:47,090
okay well yesterday was the end of my

64
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,069
90-day journey so let me tell you what

65
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,489
that is it started on August 16th and I

66
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:55,190
decided that I wanted to get to an

67
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,450
athlete level body fat percentage and I

68
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,980
wanted to lose some weight along the way

69
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,440
because that obviously is what happens

70
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,140
and when I announced that because I was

71
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:08,540
gonna be blogging the entire time people

72
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:11,510
went crazy why yeah why exactly right I

73
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,220
preach eating healthy I preach working

74
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,739
out and that's exactly how I was going

75
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,989
to attain these goals and I got called

76
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:21,530
out for being not body-positive

77
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:25,310
for hating myself for being a bad role

78
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,780
model for women for being psycho and

79
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,870
needing to go see a mental health

80
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:33,650
specialist like the craziest things and

81
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,150
the meanest stuff but I told myself that

82
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,440
I wanted to go on this journey because I

83
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,730
needed to find my authentic self

84
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,530
throughout this journey I wanted to blog

85
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,299
every day for 90 days which I hadn't

86
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,239
done for a long time because I've been

87
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,220
getting a lot of you know opinions and

88
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,560
people wanting to shape me a certain way

89
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,819
in their head and so I over the past

90
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,430
several years have become a vanilla

91
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:54,440
cupcake trying to be what everyone wants

92
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,930
me to be and so the beginning of this 90

93
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,849
days was me speaking my mind again and

94
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,680
so of course when I speak my mind with

95
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,750
very like tame stuff it's not only doing

96
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,069
anything crazy you know women's health

97
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,290
writes about it about me being

98
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,299
controversial BuzzFeed Daily Mail and it

99
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,609
was it became this thing anyway I was

100
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,840
like oh my god like I'm literally gonna

101
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,950
lose a little bit of weight and I'm

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,419
doing it in a healthy way this all

103
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,910
happened yesterday no no so that

104
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:21,950
happened on August 16 yesterday was the

105
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,990
end of my 90 days see congratulations

106
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,550
yes that's awesome that just very

107
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,620
coincidental we weren't playing

108
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,629
just do this after that yeah but okay

109
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,069
well how has the since that happened

110
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:32,900
kind of a while ago how is the response

111
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:35,680
been since like I'm sure people have

112
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,879
kind of come to their senses right like

113
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,889
I'm sure they I mean I'm sure there's

114
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,270
people who are still just like they

115
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,840
don't even read what your explanation is

116
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,990
they just know oh she's not for was it

117
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,340
body-positive body-positive

118
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,169
[Music]

119
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,610
yeah but I feel like that is that's been

120
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:55,970
your thing I don't know I guess maybe

121
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,620
that's why they might have jumped so I'm

122
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,630
gonna I'm gonna cuz I've tried to

123
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,240
analyze this so much because I know that

124
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,259
if other Fitness youtubers are bloggers

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,539
and now it's the same thing they

126
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:09,680
wouldn't get the response that I got so

127
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:13,099
I'm gonna go back about to like 2013-14

128
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,400
or something I released this video where

129
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:17,810
I was photoshopping myself to look like

130
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,830
what the comments were telling me to

131
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,880
look like why don't you have a smaller

132
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,289
waist why don't you have a bigger butt

133
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,449
you don't have abs you're not a real

134
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:25,370
fitness instructor which is really mean

135
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:26,930
because it doesn't matter what you look

136
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,960
like when you're teaching fitness you're

137
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:32,500
just teaching anyway so the video was me

138
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,849
photoshopping myself and that went viral

139
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,110
and I was on Good Morning America and

140
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:37,909
all these things it was crazy I really

141
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:42,020
didn't expect it but it was way for me

142
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:45,110
to battle the haters and after that

143
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,750
moment any time any media outlet spoke

144
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,610
about me it was body-positive fitness

145
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,500
influencer Cassie ho body-positive

146
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,039
youtuber Cassie ho it became like my

147
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,159
thing

148
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,110
yes the the the media branded me that

149
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,940
way but the reason why I even made that

150
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,400
video was because I was just a Pilates

151
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,889
instructor and I was doing videos but I

152
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,620
just didn't have visible ABS and

153
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:08,690
literally that caused the comment which

154
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,050
caused the media which now cause me to

155
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,699
be labeled as a body positive person or

156
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,009
something which is fine like that's fine

157
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,719
but the body positive movement has

158
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:20,240
evolved so much over the past several

159
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:22,069
years that now if somebody wants to lose

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,620
weight or lose fat all of a sudden you

161
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:26,599
are antibody positive and you get kicked

162
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,490
out of the community and so that's kind

163
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,740
of like what happens that's so

164
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,289
hypocritical though because it's it's

165
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,969
your you can be positive about a skinny

166
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:36,169
body right or you can be positive about

167
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,969
I mean it's not like you're saying hey

168
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,409
this is what the standard of beauty

169
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:41,059
is I mean like if you want to lose

170
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:42,529
weight and you're happy about it then I

171
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:44,779
mean I don't see why that's an issue

172
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:46,729
yeah and I mean that's how I feel about

173
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,279
it - as long as you're loving your body

174
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:50,449
along the whole journey whether you're

175
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,459
trying to gain weight or lose weight

176
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,899
like who cares even if you're trying to

177
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:55,279
get plastic surgery and you just like

178
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:57,049
love yourself you want it like that's

179
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,379
that person's choice and we shouldn't be

180
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:02,779
here to judge them but yeah it's just

181
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:04,249
really changed the the evolution of

182
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:07,189
body-positive you have changed over the

183
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:09,049
years and when I announced it people

184
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,699
went crazy they were like unsubscribe

185
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:12,649
you're terrible human you need to get

186
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,539
psychological help you're mentally ill

187
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:17,059
like these words kept repeating over and

188
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:19,039
over and it was interesting because this

189
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:21,829
for me was a blog journey so a lot of it

190
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,719
was writing I didn't release a video on

191
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:25,819
YouTube and the meanest comments

192
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:28,759
actually came from YouTube not from

193
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,829
Facebook or Instagram YouTube was really

194
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,599
critical because they didn't go over to

195
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:35,089
read my blog I think and just like judge

196
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,709
me based on like you know a little

197
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:38,959
caption and then go read here for the

198
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:40,459
rest they just like went wild and so

199
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,739
anyway it was lots of drama in the

200
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:45,259
beginning towards the middle still drama

201
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:46,819
little less a little less I just like

202
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:48,559
actually stopped posting on the YouTube

203
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,709
community tab as much because it just

204
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:54,679
fired people up for some reason even if

205
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:57,679
when it was positive stuff and then

206
00:07:54,679 --> 00:08:00,649
towards the end now I'm about to do my

207
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:03,199
finale recap and I think that's gonna be

208
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:05,479
drama drama - but I am happy to tell you

209
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,459
that I did reach my goals which is

210
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,229
really cool because yes who's in the

211
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:11,389
beginning when I announce my goals here

212
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:13,429
are so many people saying oh you're

213
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,169
number yeah you're so irresponsible for

214
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:17,209
announcing your numbers you make me feel

215
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,069
bad and all the kind of stuff and it was

216
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:21,589
just like insane yeah but you know what

217
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:24,169
I kept going before you even did this 90

218
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:26,179
day challenge did you expect that sort

219
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,039
of response or at least think like maybe

220
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:31,309
I'll get this or was that like not even

221
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:34,430
in your thought process well I knew that

222
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:36,769
it was gonna stir something but I didn't

223
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:40,399
know it would stir as much as it did it

224
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:42,229
was like I there was hatred like actual

225
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,529
like you are a bad human I did not

226
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,029
expect that so that was a lecture I was

227
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,130
actually really hard to deal with and

228
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,959
still is right now because I thought for

229
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,769
me with diet and exercise diet would be

230
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,540
hard because I like to

231
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:57,439
everything I can like literally eat

232
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:00,319
forever but dealing with the negativity

233
00:08:57,439 --> 00:09:02,019
that's been pushed on me that's been the

234
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:03,949
hardest thing yeah

235
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,660
well it almost seems like you're just

236
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:07,459
another victim to cancer culture

237
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,779
somebody who's just like you know

238
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:11,360
Fanning the Flint that people just like

239
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,860
to be upset about something and I mean I

240
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,199
think if people actually took the time

241
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,629
to hear what your side of the story was

242
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:20,299
and not just I mean I'm assuming they're

243
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:21,980
just seeing things in a very broad scope

244
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:23,779
like reading up like reading a headline

245
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,600
in an article and not reading the

246
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:28,519
article exactly and it just seems like I

247
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,009
don't mean I personally can't see how

248
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,779
that's negative like I can't I can't

249
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:34,429
understand that you just wanted to go on

250
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,689
and die it how is that gonna I don't

251
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:39,860
know there's some mind blowing to me

252
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:41,269
well I think like I I read the comments

253
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,429
and you know there's hateful ones and

254
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:44,959
then there's constructive and I

255
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:47,059
understand where some of these girls are

256
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,399
coming from because some of them may

257
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:51,589
have an eating disorder I myself had an

258
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,569
eating disorder like way back then where

259
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:55,790
I was scared of bananas and things like

260
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:56,959
that and so mentally there was a time

261
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,389
period where I needed to heal myself

262
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,639
luckily through lots of work I am healed

263
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:03,709
now and so I think some fans were

264
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,990
generally concerned that I was falling

265
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:09,019
back into something dangerous so I get

266
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,850
that but after explaining myself and

267
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,980
them seeing me being on this thing for

268
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,660
45 days I'm totally fine like and still

269
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,519
getting that it's like you really just

270
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,920
don't want to see that I am better and

271
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,619
I'm getting better so and I think maybe

272
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,779
a lot of people look to influencers to

273
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:26,329
validate what they're doing because it's

274
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:28,189
like oh I look like her and it's okay to

275
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:30,259
eat like that or work out like that and

276
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:32,839
whatever and all of a sudden your idol

277
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:34,699
is now changing it's like I'm lost who

278
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,559
do I follow now you've betrayed me I

279
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:38,299
kind of think like that's probably what

280
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,689
happened yeah I could understand that I

281
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:43,249
guess when you say eating disorder does

282
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:45,290
that mean eating too much or eating too

283
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:46,790
little so there's a lot of forms of

284
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,709
eating disorders there's you know

285
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,209
there's anorexia where you don't eat

286
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:52,069
anything you eat very very little

287
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,759
there's bulimia where you throw up the

288
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:57,559
food that you eat

289
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:59,540
I had orthorexia which means I only ate

290
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:02,149
healthy food and I was scared of

291
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,220
anything that wasn't healthy it's a

292
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:06,790
disorder you know I

293
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:10,130
I hate it is I don't know if it's like

294
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,320
medically a disorder but like something

295
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,780
just made it up like I like only healthy

296
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,510
food so I'm going to call it this is it

297
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,430
making me was it unhealthy well it was

298
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,610
because the fear of food so I always

299
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:25,100
felt like I was in food Jail so I wait

300
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,850
so I was in a bikini competition and for

301
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,080
that I was super high protein low fat

302
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,110
pretty much eating just like egg whites

303
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,240
protein powder counted my almonds and

304
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,000
like very very low calorie during that

305
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,340
period when I was getting lean and after

306
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,140
that period I was terrified of eating

307
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,450
bananas and apples I just thought they

308
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,760
were gonna make me fat and so mentally I

309
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,620
was messed up and I it took me a while

310
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,630
like actually a few years to break out

311
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,060
of that cycle because I also messed up

312
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,040
my body and had metabolic damage meaning

313
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,330
that sometimes I ate pizza and I would

314
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,860
lose weight and sometimes we eat salad

315
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,590
and gain weight and nothing worked and

316
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,200
so yeah kinda messed up my body when you

317
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:06,200
when you talk about like the people who

318
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,810
are complaining about like the the fact

319
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,470
that you're not body positive right

320
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,780
are these if are these types of people

321
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,630
are they a certain type like do they

322
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:21,560
have a certain type of disorder or is it

323
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,370
because I'm thinking that maybe the fact

324
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,310
that you're trying to lose weight

325
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,070
there's the the people are saying that

326
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,660
you're not positive about being

327
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:32,150
overweight is it is that what they're

328
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,350
basically saying vice are you asking if

329
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,990
the people that are commenting that are

330
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,110
overweight people yes basically I did in

331
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,980
a very peaceful yeah because I

332
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,420
understand that I understand that like

333
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,680
you should love your body even if you

334
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,810
are overweight and I know there may be

335
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,160
people who have issues with being

336
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,860
overweight and it's tough for them to

337
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,870
lose it but I mean I think it's general

338
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:55,220
knowledge that being overweight is

339
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:58,310
unhealthy right here's my problem with

340
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,760
terms like overweight and obese it's

341
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:04,460
based off of a standard yes a healthier

342
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,740
nose what was it a bunch of Caucasian

343
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,900
people or what was it like what was it

344
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,210
like do you like our Asian standards the

345
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,620
same as whatever the standards in the

346
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,320
you know these medical textbooks are so

347
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,940
I I don't feel comfortable with

348
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,900
standards I think they help doctors make

349
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,310
a decision

350
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,670
and I think when it comes down to it

351
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,890
it's a very individual thing do I know

352
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,480
if the people who are mad at me were

353
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:29,840
overweight or not I literally have no

354
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,230
idea but I can say that there they are

355
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,060
people most likely with insecurities I'm

356
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,060
gonna say whether it be that they're

357
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:41,570
overweight or not yeah or or whatever

358
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,850
yeah or something and so I mean I don't

359
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,410
want to say that they're just projecting

360
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,650
on me or whatever but it very much felt

361
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,320
that way and it was interesting to have

362
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:56,420
your own fan base kind of just judge you

363
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:58,190
so hard and yeah but it's all good right

364
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,020
now internally because I don't ever

365
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,760
regret going on this I feel amazing I

366
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,920
have so much more energy I'm stronger

367
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,170
I'm faster and I'm just glad I did this

368
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,030
to prove to myself that I could make

369
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,340
some goals and then reach them I asked

370
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,110
what diet you did and what did you do

371
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,260
exactly what change

372
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,000
what did I change so um the first month

373
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:21,830
I did keto have any of you guys done

374
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,020
Kido yeah okay cool I did keto but I I'm

375
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,000
lactose intolerant but I wanted to eat

376
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,320
the cheese and the yogurts and stuff and

377
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,030
I started breaking out a lot but I did

378
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,530
lose a 5,000 the first month but

379
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,600
anything I do in the first month I was

380
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,370
about five pounds then I ate so many

381
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,660
nuts that I kept gaining weight steadily

382
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,970
for a couple weeks and is like oh my god

383
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,620
what's happening and then I realize okay

384
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,690
Cassie like let's be honest with

385
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,000
yourself you are just overeating and

386
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,560
like I told you I can eat forever like

387
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,210
take me to a buffet and I will out eat

388
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,980
anyone I actually want to be a

389
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,840
competitive eater but I'm not gonna do

390
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,310
that but I really want to have a burrito

391
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,820
that's as big as a baby have you seen

392
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:58,640
those no no okay I kind of bit that's

393
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:09,320
not a normal baby right there are like

394
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:12,160
three footballs well something about

395
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,300
your dieting oh dieting yes so

396
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,370
overeating realize that I was probably

397
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,620
overeating even though as eating healthy

398
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,560
things um so the thing that really

399
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,510
changed it for me was tracking my food

400
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,130
in my fitness pal and writing down okay

401
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,500
I had this much and this and it really

402
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,510
taught me you know I feel like I know

403
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,190
portions but you can always feel your

404
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,560
hand a little extra make your tablespoon

405
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,270
like

406
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,920
twice as much and so really logging

407
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:39,029
everything weighing my food kept me

408
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,770
really strict in in a good way because I

409
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,140
knew exactly what I was doing what was

410
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,400
ingesting in my body I knew the macros

411
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,510
and everything and so that really

412
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,850
changed it for me

413
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,440
yeah and workouts though I mean for the

414
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,510
most part I did like one rest day a week

415
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,820
I started dancing more towards the end

416
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,290
of my journey and that made me less

417
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,990
stressed and were happy I feel like if

418
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,490
you didn't work out you wouldn't be as

419
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,440
hungry I think you're so hungry because

420
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,270
you work out so much people work out eat

421
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,900
more right I mean you need more energy

422
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:09,330
okay so I did this blood test a genetic

423
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,300
fit test and I've also done 23andme have

424
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:16,140
you guys done that okay so in my 23andme

425
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:19,589
it says that I am genetically more

426
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:22,980
predisposed to be overweight and my

427
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:25,950
sister has fetus - predisposed to be

428
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,339
underweight also my dad I think my mom

429
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:31,080
was like normal Sam my husband is

430
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,970
predisposed to be underweight so or the

431
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,730
same weight so I already have the genes

432
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,380
that make it difficult for me to be able

433
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,940
to have a lean body which is interesting

434
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,760
because I'm in the fitness industry and

435
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,020
almost everyone has a lean body so where

436
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,300
was I going with this I lost my train of

437
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,560
thought again well that's fine I mean I

438
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,570
think I was just saying that I

439
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,550
personally the people I need to work out

440
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,350
the most eat the most right because you

441
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,270
need energy and anyway so I took at this

442
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,950
genetic fit test that not only confirmed

443
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:59,790
that but it also said that I had like

444
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:02,790
some genetic variant that said I like to

445
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:05,939
eat a lot so I know that was you know

446
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,910
the thing I mean I probably have that

447
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:11,130
too I can eat a lot well you also seem

448
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,810
to have high metabolism I think no I got

449
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,459
gained a lot really gained a lot of

450
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,620
weight really quickly and then he was a

451
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:20,140
lot of weight really quick oh wow I used

452
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:23,680
to wrestle so I did really unhealthy

453
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,589
crash diets I say you know yeah a couple

454
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,170
days and were you doing like this mostly

455
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,450
water weight but yeah but yeah I mean

456
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,310
there was this like when I start myself

457
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,680
it was like the worst I mean you know

458
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:38,890
wrestlers yeah I'm sure you know those

459
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,230
weight classes yeah yeah so that was a

460
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,700
thing and we did the whole you know they

461
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,890
would do the whole body fat testing

462
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,630
hydration test we'd have to measure your

463
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,190
fat yeah yeah yeah all that stuff and

464
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,080
and there's always people that there's

465
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,180
ways around it like it's a very

466
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,530
unhealthy do you tell me about it

467
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,720
I mean I don't want to encourage other

468
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,920
people wrestling right now I'm sure they

469
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,630
have better ways but they would

470
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,610
essentially the hydration test would

471
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,110
measure how much it your body fat is

472
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,750
there's a minimum right I think it's

473
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,590
like for guys it's like 7% or six six or

474
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,440
something like that I don't know what it

475
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,850
is the healthy body fat and then they

476
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,040
compare that to your weight and how

477
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,350
hydrated you are see pee in a cup okay

478
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,710
so I need people that would just use

479
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:20,530
like little Visine bottles and just use

480
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,330
that to hydrate their pee a little bit

481
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,280
more Oh so they'd be completely

482
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,160
dehydrated but they'd pee a little

483
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,240
add some water to it and using that that

484
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,230
I don't know what that thing is where

485
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,390
they look into this like a little

486
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,310
crystal tube thing and they see how

487
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,230
hydrated you are it basically that's the

488
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:38,470
way a lot of people cheated that stuff

489
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,160
oh wow okay so yeah resting is a very

490
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,190
dangerous sport

491
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,650
we're spitting into a bucket what that's

492
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,750
what that's what they did with my I did

493
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,220
wrestling as well oh you didn't there

494
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,810
were some people who spit into a bucket

495
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,280
like they would chew gum just to lose

496
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:54,370
weight I mean it was like not much

497
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,080
weight obviously oh if you keep doing it

498
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,680
all day long you'll you'll have some

499
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,190
water weight that could you cry it out

500
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,510
I'm sure we watch some sad movies you'd

501
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,630
be surprised I mean we did some

502
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,460
dangerous stuff like we used to like

503
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,200
we're trash bags uh-huh and then go

504
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,140
running and then just sit sit in a hot

505
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,750
car choke the heaters and then you know

506
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,000
take X Lacs and all that stuff oh my

507
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,890
gosh so you think you did damage to

508
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,130
yourself I think I did a good good

509
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,260
amount yeah that sounds like you used to

510
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,030
make weight and just bad habits I think

511
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,890
over it and I started like you know we'd

512
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,780
eat so much and then like see you our

513
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,430
weight increased by like 10 pounds and

514
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,000
then just crash and just lose it all and

515
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,920
then

516
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,750
mentality kind of stayed with me so

517
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,540
surgeon degree I don't do that as crazy

518
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:43,390
but like I think it's a very dangerous

519
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,070
habit to get I mean I think it's a habit

520
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,620
because I think I still do that to a

521
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,030
certain degree not start myself like oh

522
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,280
I'm gonna just lose it in a couple weeks

523
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:54,370
and then if I gain it back I'll just

524
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,380
lose it again huh yeah that's crazy and

525
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,290
it's interesting because we never really

526
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,790
talked about been dieting or men's view

527
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,480
of their bodies and how they feel about

528
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,570
it

529
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,030
yeah and a lot of I mean I don't call it

530
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,440
names a lot of people they God guys they

531
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,270
care about that stuff too oh for sure

532
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,640
yeah getting bigger getting ripped yeah

533
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,970
you know being skinnier you know stuff

534
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,890
like that

535
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,120
yeah normal I would say I think

536
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,360
especially when you're in front of a

537
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,250
camera you can notice like I notice if I

538
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,900
even gained like three pound I mean is

539
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:28,330
that a lot if I can't like even three

540
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:30,730
pounds like you can see yeah so you know

541
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,930
I feel sad and then I'll be like okay

542
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,040
I'm not eating for the next three days

543
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:38,680

544
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:42,280
the way that you look in the mirror ever

I don't oh not really not me safe for me

546
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,450
I yeah I would I would say like there's

547
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,850
days where like man I don't want to take

548
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,960
a picture today you know or like in and

549
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,640
then there's times when all like lose

550
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,820
weight and I feel not because I feel

551
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,380
like skinny is beautiful but like I just

552
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,240
feel like that's the right weight for me

553
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,620
like this is what my face should look

554
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,270
like or this is what my body should look

555
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,220
like you feel comfortable yeah yeah yeah

556
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,320
and then I'm it's not that I don't when

557
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,820
I'm bigger like I don't mind yeah but

558
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,860
it's just like this is like what it

559
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,250
should be for me for like what I want

560
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,690
right so yeah I mean I would say there's

561
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,640
definitely days where I'd be like I

562
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,750
don't want to take a picture today yeah

563
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,550
you were just talking about this today

564
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:23,950
uh with what you you said you do you you

565
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:26,050
were working out more and oh yeah just

566
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,090
like cuz you never work out I never work

567
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,790
out but like for me um

568
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,890
just noticing like when you look a

569
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,150
little bit more out of shape for me like

570
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,500
I just want to look skinnier mostly

571
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,090
because I know if I'm skinnier that

572
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,130
means I'm more fit

573
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,740
and it ought to be able to perform

574
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,960
better when I play sports right and see

575
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,260
it's like performance based yeah that is

576
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,470
true

577
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,960
yeah but I don't know is it about

578
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,660
halftime that's why yeah we're about

579
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,920
there shall we take a two-hour shishi

580
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,920
break yeah let's do it

581
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,900
all right so routine shishi break right

582
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,940
now and apparently this is a new thing

583
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,650
so what do you have prepared for us

584
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,150
you're gonna serenade us or perform

585
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:07,960
something where I have potential I don't

586
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:20,020
even know what she is where we take a

587
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:22,750
bathroom break and we are half time half

588
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:26,530
time break so what talent do you have

589
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:29,860
that you can perform in 30 seconds oh I

590
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:34,440
can sound like a pigeon okay for 30

591
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,440
seconds what 30 no you just go ahead I

592
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:42,310
don't know what a pigeon sounds like

593
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:45,160
about that is in Hawaii I've had friends

594
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:47,530
do that and then they have their uh flip

595
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,390
flop or slip via slipper loosely on

596
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:54,550
their foot and they slap it okay so like

597
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:55,870
the wings core yeah we didn't we this is

598
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:59,020
literally our first time asking someone

599
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:01,090
to do that so you do that we're gonna

600
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,710
just start asking halftime show all

601
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,380
right we'll be right back after our CC

602
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:13,880
break

603
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:18,360
[Music]

604
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:20,880
and we're back I got a question okay

605
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,430
have you ever fasted like a straight

606
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,500
fast with just water no I have not

607
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:27,810
I've read a lot about that and

608
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,610
apparently it's very good for you to do

609
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,620
that once in a while like a straight up

610
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:34,050
fast so I've never done that I've done a

611
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,850
juice fast but that's still like calorie

612
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:39,120
like 1,200 calories a day so I was never

613
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:41,160
actually 1200 calories of juice juice I

614
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,070
just pressed Juicery but like they're

615
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,050
beginners pack it was too sweet though

616
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:47,910
but it made me lose straight-up seven

617
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,920
pounds in three days but it was just

618
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,360
water weight yeah in wastage instead of

619
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,550
stuff like that mm-hmm yeah but I've

620
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,290
never done a water cleanse but yeah I've

621
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,510
heard like monks can do it up to like a

622
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,180
month like I don't know I just really

623
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:02,640
like chewing yeah I love food too but I

624
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:06,930
tried it for three days it was thinking

625
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:10,140
about food I will say that it did give

626
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:13,050
me a lot of clarity is weird okay how

627
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,220
did that happen I don't know that I mean

628
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,920
I hear that that's what happens when

629
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,020
you're on keto to my your brain

630
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,060
functions a little bit differently and

631
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,890
you do get like this weird kind of

632
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,350
energy that's not your like normal

633
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:28,340
physical energy we do you like this like

634
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,490
your it seemed like my brain was not

635
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,460
tired

636
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,800
it didn't seem tired yeah exactly I felt

637
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,990
pretty sharp actually when you don't

638
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,520
think about food then then your thoughts

639
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,430
and the things that you have to focus on

640
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,500
actually are very clear so I don't know

641
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:48,120
I noticed that for myself just want to

642
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:50,220
see if you when I was on keto though for

643
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,170
that month it was it was definitely not

644
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,870
the diet for me like I was constantly

645
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,370
thirsty drinking like hmm you're

646
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,930
supposed to be though right I almost

647
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,640
like that - I was super thirsty I

648
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,760
started getting these keto like flu

649
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,890
headaches did you get that - I'm out

650
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,410
right yeah so then my friend who wrote

651
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,420
like a book on keto he was like oh you

652
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,310
need to take like you put salt in your

653
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,420
hand and actually like eat it plus you

654
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,520
need all these supplements and I was

655
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,170
like what that's not my thing like I

656
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,150
just really like to be food is my

657
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,800
medicine medicine was my food so I just

658
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,900
decided that wasn't for me yeah I don't

659
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,180
think I did it the right way

660
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,220
we're like you check your key I just do

661
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,350
that I didn't want to prick my finger I

662
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,640
hate needles I cry still as an adult I

663
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,290
didn't even know you could do that but I

664
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,580
didn't yeah yeah you like you're

665
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,080
supposed to prick your finger check your

666
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,930
ketones and be like Oh am I in ketosis

667
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,690
or not yeah I didn't do it dad I did it

668
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,340
back before keto was keto before iya was

669
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,250
a thing like I did it wrong but it was

670
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:47,330
like before it was a fad I would say

671
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:49,370
back in like 2010 so then you're doing

672
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,340
like Atkins basically kind of but no

673
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,980
carb yeah like even down to like well

674
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,260
low-carb yeah down to like okay this has

675
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,580
one gram I'm not gonna eat it Wow yeah

676
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,410
because I didn't know I didn't know

677
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,270
anything there was no real information

678
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,920
out there I just knew that by starving

679
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,300
yourself with carbs your energy will

680
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,400
come from your fat that's all I knew I

681
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,910
didn't know anything else and that's not

682
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:13,040
quite the right way to do it but it it

683
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,840
works I mean you lose weight you just

684
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,730
don't feel great no you don't you know

685
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,410
any time you take out an entire food

686
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,090
group you're probably gonna lose weight

687
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,070
from the initial shock anyway right

688
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:25,880
and then you'll plateau yes uh-huh

689
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:28,310
uh-huh yeah yeah so I was wondering when

690
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,350
like what got you into the fitness thing

691
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:32,180
like were you when you were young where

692
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,950
you always make into sports and were you

693
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,110
very active and is that what kind of

694
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:39,560
triggered that or was it was it

695
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:41,030
something else okay so my dad trained me

696
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,440
and my sister in tennis when we were

697
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,690
really young so I started playing tennis

698
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,860
when I was like five or six

699
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:51,350
he's a USTA coach and oh man it was like

700
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:56,150
Asian dad yelling at you on the court

701
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:57,650
situation but he he was a good coach I

702
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,120
suppose because I made varsity my

703
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:01,400
freshman year as team captain from

704
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,990
sophomore to senior year but I hated

705
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,820
tennis so much because it had always

706
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,400
been about it being for my dad for

707
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,250
winning for the team so I didn't

708
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:13,400
discover Fitness until I was 16 because

709
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:15,140
when I was 16 I wanted to do a pageant I

710
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,650
wanted to do the Miss Teen Chinatown

711
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,970
pageant and I wanted to you know look

712
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,820
good for it and like you know when

713
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,900
you're a teenager is 16 and it's like

714
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,090
2002 like I didn't know anything about

715
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,160
fitness but I saw an infomercial for

716
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,240
Mari Winsor Pilates and I asked my

717
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,260
parents to find me a DVD because it

718
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,340
looked really cool like these women just

719
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,380
lifting their leg I was like that's

720
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,730
really fun you bought it for me and then

721
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,500
I did those videos real

722
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:40,220
justly and fell in love with like home

723
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,650
fitness and it's crazy because now girls

724
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,230
do my videos just like that on YouTube

725
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,600
in their bedroom so when I was 16 I

726
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,840
discovered Pilates I ended up getting

727
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,020
certified as a sophomore in college and

728
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,190
then I started teaching just on the side

729
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,169
and then I didn't start my youtube

730
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,270
channel until after college and really

731
00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:02,030
it was just I was moving from LA to

732
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,620
Boston for my very first job and my

733
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,299
students at 24 hour fitness are like Oh

734
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,580
Cassie who else is gonna teach us this

735
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:09,530
because my format is pop pilates pilates

736
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,330
- pop music it's kind of like a dance on

737
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:13,880
the mat no one else was teaching that

738
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,500
and so I said okay I'm gonna record this

739
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,059
10-minute video put it on his website

740
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,850
called YouTube it's just for you guys

741
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:21,169
like 40 people then I left and that's

742
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,700
how the YouTube channel got started

743
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:24,590
because I wanted to continue teaching

744
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,510
from a distance which is crazy because

745
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,820
that's exactly what I'm doing right now

746
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:31,460
except the world yeah that is crazy

747
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,690
you've done in person I've seen pictures

748
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:38,450
of like you with like hundreds of people

749
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:40,400
like in person yes like this the dance

750
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,100
routines and stuff that's insane it's

751
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,500
crazy my biggest one was Singapore and

752
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,390
we were on the Empress LAN and we're all

753
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,000
doing like plie squats and I could

754
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,140
barely see to the horizon but I later

755
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,610
read that there were three to four

756
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,120
thousand people they had a plie

757
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:57,320
squatting with me and I was like in

758
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,710
Singapore where it's like 90 degrees

759
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:03,530
with like a hundred percent humidity

760
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:06,140
Singaporeans are so like perfect like

761
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,179
they were all on beat I don't know how

762
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,400
but yeah I mean everything about them is

763
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:15,040
perfect it's like school for that

764
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:17,600
everything by the book yeah well a

765
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,940
couple of questions because you said you

766
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,340
graduated college right yeah but what

767
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:25,130
did you graduate biology so I majored in

768
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,950
biology and minored in business and then

769
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:30,890
you are also like fashion buying at some

770
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,630
point yeah that's right so I had always

771
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,610
wanted to be a fashion designer I've

772
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,650
drawn dresses ever since I was a little

773
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,669
girl but when I told my dad and my mom

774
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,299
that he wanted to become a fashion

775
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:39,620
designer

776
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:41,299
they were like you were definitely not

777
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,950
doing that because you're gonna be poor

778
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:45,630
and have no friends and

779
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,470
I don't know all the other mean stuff

780
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:49,650
you just see well you won't be

781
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:50,580
successful ever so I decided to not do

782
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,990
it he said you should be a doctor

783
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,580
because you're doing well in bio and

784
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,549
chem right now so just go do that and so

785
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,160
I did that but my heart was just not

786
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:01,890
into it my soul was gone and so I always

787
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:05,640
drew things on the side and while I was

788
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:07,440
teaching Pilates in college I I had to

789
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,850
hold my yoga mat my CD my keys

790
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,309
everything was all over the place like

791
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:13,920
this and so I decided to design a yoga

792
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,450
bag for myself and when my student saw

793
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,610
it they really wanted to buy it then I

794
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:20,340
found a local manufacturer to make some

795
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:22,799
of these bags and before I left for

796
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,980
Boston I remember sending out a few bags

797
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,419
to some magazines but at this time you

798
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,600
know every bag that you make is like

799
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:33,450
gold because it's all you have about

800
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,010
eight months into my new job as a as

801
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,570
training to become a fashion buyer so I

802
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:38,429
really was like no I'm not doing this

803
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,020
whole biology thing my parents were so

804
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:42,059
mad at me because I dropped out of

805
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,799
organic chemistry last minute to make

806
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:46,500
sure I could not make it in time for my

807
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:48,900
MCAT I had to sabotage myself because I

808
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,130
was such an obedient child that I just

809
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,630
went through with everything that they

810
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,940
said I wanted to be perfect and so I

811
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:57,000
really had to sabotage myself anyway so

812
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,000
eight months into my fashion buying job

813
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,250
my sister is texting me and her fingers

814
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,160
pointing to something on on in the text

815
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:08,040
and I noticed that it's my yoga bag in

816
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:11,910
shape magazine and so I took it as a

817
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,530
sign to quit my job and go for this 100%

818
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,820
because you never know if you're gonna

819
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,610
make it if you don't give it your all

820
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,169
right and so I quit my job

821
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,179
I bought a ticket to China on Friday and

822
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:23,760
left on Sunday went to the Canton Fair I

823
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:26,070
found a manufacturer and then let the

824
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,650
bags develop I came back to Boston and

825
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:31,169
pretty much just kept making youtube

826
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,870
videos cuz now I had no job and I was

827
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:36,600
teaching like at 6:00 a.m. 12 p.m. and

828
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,490
as 6:00 a.m. like every day and it was

829
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,440
weird 12 times a week barely making any

830
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:43,440
money and just trying to hustle Wow

831
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,360
so yeah that is a you don't I don't know

832
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,610
if people realize how rare that is and

833
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,960
crazy and risky yeah especially because

834
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,900
it seems like your childhood seemed to

835
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,650
be almost like a like a very your

836
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,600
stereotype like the tiny you for Chinese

837
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,180
Chinese being

838
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,370
okaywell Asian parents say become a

839
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,660
doctor don't do this other nonsense and

840
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,060
you decide to walk away from that

841
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,520
pissing them off in the process yeah and

842
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:11,540
going all in but everything's good now

843
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,360
with the family they don't like that

844
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:17,120
you're you know it's one of those things

845
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,720
where it's like never enough okay so

846
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,310
like even even if it's like I think they

847
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,080
are proud of me because it's this whole

848
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:26,960
landscape they don't even understand but

849
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,430
it's always more like well why can't you

850
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,080
sell more you know just like those

851
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:36,080
little questions here and there like

852
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:38,300
yeah you know it doesn't make a follow

853
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,100
up question to that yes a lot of people

854
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,780
you know they constantly want to know

855
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,660
from their idols or people that they

856
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,220
look up to what made you make the jump

857
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,670
because you've made several different

858
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,530
jumps what gave you the courage or what

859
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,790
was the signs and what allowed you to

860
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,740
persevere through the hard times like

861
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:57,080
especially when the only thing paying

862
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:00,890
your bills was doing Pilates and you see

863
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:03,860
you had it rough yeah what made me take

864
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:05,210
the leap was that if no one was gonna

865
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,670
believe in me I needed to believe in

866
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,440
myself and if I were gonna fail I wanted

867
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,180
to fail hard and know that and be like

868
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,390
okay we're good with that I don't want

869
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,310
to ever regret that I never tried and so

870
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:21,070
I'm always willing to take the risk on

871
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:23,510
myself and you know back then as a

872
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:25,550
college kid I just wanted to follow my

873
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,230
passion whatever that meant but

874
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,670
following my passion follow my gut has

875
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,260
gotten me to where I am today because I

876
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,240
know what feels right and what doesn't

877
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,640
and my whole motto is do more what makes

878
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,320
you happy do less of what doesn't and so

879
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,080
following that has allowed me to get

880
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:44,120
here do you think though uh because a

881
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:46,910
lot of people like yeah nice but uh you

882
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,890
did in a way your parents instilled a

883
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:51,620
lot of hard work ethics into you it

884
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,480
sounds like just because even with

885
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,980
talking about your 90 day you're just

886
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,930
like yeah I studied all this stuff I

887
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,630
know yeah and just everything you've

888
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,310
talked about so far it just seems you

889
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,740
extensively done research you take notes

890
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,510
and you put work into it right so it

891
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,129
requires a lot of that as well

892
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:12,059
maybe if you want to speak on that

893
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:13,799
yeah I mean clearly it's not like follow

894
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:16,049
my heart la-dee-da everything's gonna be

895
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:20,339
fine you need to have a plan

896
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:22,079
you know like plan a plan B and but when

897
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:24,509
but but I do believe that when you go

898
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,669
for something you have to go all-in it's

899
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:30,059
kind of like I don't know have you guys

900
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:31,649
ever Rock climbed or you know whatever

901
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:33,210
okay dude doing something we're pretty

902
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:35,819
much if you don't go all-in you're gonna

903
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:38,399
fall off you have to just make the leap

904
00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:40,349
and so for me that's what I needed to do

905
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,349
in real life to see if it was gonna work

906
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:45,299
or not and I don't know maybe it is

907
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:47,879
something innate maybe it is well not

908
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:50,899
maybe definitely my parents trained me

909
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:54,539
to be a very studious person a very

910
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:57,390
disciplined person but also I'm a high

911
00:34:54,539 --> 00:35:00,509
achiever and I like progress I like

912
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:02,190
results and I like it and that a I mean

913
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:03,690
like that's just who I am it stressed me

914
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,279
out throughout school but I really liked

915
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:08,369
it and I liked reaching my goal this

916
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:10,229
time it brings me a lot of joy so yeah I

917
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:12,779
mean you just got to be smart about it

918
00:35:10,229 --> 00:35:14,609
cuz like it's not like I went for my

919
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:16,289
dreams and invested all my money or

920
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:17,700
their very little that I had that time

921
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:18,960
into these bags I didn't know what's

922
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,729
gonna happen I was still teaching I was

923
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,670
still hustling I was still I was doing

924
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:24,989
like Craigslist jobs like I think if it

925
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,880
were back then I probably would have

926
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,049
been driving ubers and delivering post

927
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,539
mates like I would have just like done

928
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:31,920
everything and been very humble about it

929
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:34,440
until I could get where I wanted to be

930
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,960
right mm-hmm what do you tell yourself

931
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,420
like do you ever think about what could

932
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,099
potentially go wrong and do you try to

933
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,049
convince yourself like if it goes wrong

934
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:45,029
then this will happen or are you just

935
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:48,390
more like kind of stubborn when it comes

936
00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:49,529
to those types of you know scenarios in

937
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,420
your head and you're like I will never

938
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:53,969
let that happen well things are always

939
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,009
gonna happen I'm so many terrible and

940
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:58,200
things have gone wrong in my life but I

941
00:35:56,009 --> 00:36:00,989
immediately switch into problem-solving

942
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,710
mode there's no time to be sad about it

943
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:05,969
it's like how do we fix this now so you

944
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,160
just got to be ready anyway if you're

945
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:10,049
not ready just start thinking really

946
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,789
hard how are you gonna fix this because

947
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:13,920
I think the great thing about problems

948
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:16,469
is it makes me my most creative right

949
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,880
true absolutely that's interesting you

950
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:20,999
say that you in the beginning that you

951
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,509
were very sensitive and emotional person

952
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:23,459
but it's

953
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:25,829
your very logic base when it comes to

954
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:27,869
work that's a thing when it comes to

955
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:29,279
work I'm super logic base and super pom

956
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:32,459
solving but when it comes to people

957
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:35,729
judging my character I become like this

958
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:38,999
like really soft thing that just melts

959
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:40,799
and dies that's so interesting to me cuz

960
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:44,069
it's usually it's more almost one or the

961
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:47,369
other but it's kind of both yeah so like

962
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:50,579
I think back to school and I feel like I

963
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:53,219
had a hard time socially because I don't

964
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:56,579
know like I I my high achieving self

965
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:59,369
made it hard for people to like me

966
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:00,089
I guess I don't know but it definitely

967
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:02,699
wasn't cool

968
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:06,089
it definitely wasn't cool and I always

969
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:08,069
struggled in the social scene and I

970
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:09,630
think that's where that whole the

971
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:11,880
comments affect me so much thing comes

972
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,559
from because that's a social thing yeah

973
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,029
but work-wise I've always been like I

974
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:16,529
don't care I'm just gonna go for it I'm

975
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:17,909
gonna do it whatever and that's

976
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:20,099
something you're confident I'm very

977
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:24,029
confident in my skills but when it comes

978
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:26,069
to social stuff what about the social

979
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:27,929
stuff were you kind of uneasy about like

980
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:30,509
is it was it hard to make friends was it

981
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:32,429
regarding to regarding dating or was it

982
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:35,219
like interacting with teachers like was

983
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:42,899
it okay teachers have always been fine

984
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:46,349
because like stood friends yeah I mean

985
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:48,149
like I don't know I I just see I'm even

986
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:50,069
struggling with it now I just like I

987
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:54,899
don't know okay I'll tell you about one

988
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:58,949
time so I I ran for a student government

989
00:37:54,899 --> 00:38:01,169
freshman year of high school and um and

990
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:03,539
here's the thing I'm not well liked but

991
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:05,130
I am well known back in that scene

992
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:07,439
because of all the things that I did and

993
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,659
all the clubs I was in or whatever but

994
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:11,789
when I was in student government which

995
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:13,919
is super clicky and super popular kids I

996
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,989
remember we were making a float for

997
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:17,969
homecoming and I was in charge of the

998
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:19,619
budget obviously and so we got Walmart

999
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:21,059
and trying to buy hairspray to like

1000
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,919
spray down thing to make them stick up

1001
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:24,269
these like tissue papers and so I'm like

1002
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:26,579
okay we should buy the generic brand

1003
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:28,709
because it's cheaper than this like

1004
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:31,889
Tresemme or something like that and the

1005
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:34,049
kids like they videotaped me and then

1006
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:34,980
they sent that video around it's telling

1007
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:36,119
everyone that I was cheap

1008
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,060
like I don't just like stuff like that

1009
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:41,460
happening scars me and like I still

1010
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,280
remember that so I don't know what that

1011
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,020
is but I just have always struggled

1012
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:53,670
socially so do you now buy the more

1013
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:55,740
expensive okay like home goods Marshalls

1014
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,510
TV but I want saving money you know when

1015
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,580
it's time to buy a luxury you you can

1016
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,920
splurge but like be smart when you can

1017
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:04,980
be smart mm-hmm so we have some

1018
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,369
questions from fans here oh wow okay yep

1019
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,140
we got one here from Marianne she asks

1020
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:15,750
would you ever consider running a

1021
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:18,660
marathon no easy answer I ran a half

1022
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:22,590
marathon that's still freezing

1023
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:26,670
I hate running like I hate it like I'll

1024
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:29,580
do it but I do not enjoy it in any

1025
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:32,310
aspect my legs hurt my mind's numb I

1026
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:35,010
just like really don't like it yeah so

1027
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:36,240
no do you like it though no see I don't

1028
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,359
like sports either because I don't like

1029
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,310
being competitive physically like that I

1030
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,810
guess like internally I'm like semi

1031
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,550
competitive just based on my work stuff

1032
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,780
but not like that it overtakes my life

1033
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,220
but that's why I do really didn't like

1034
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,720
playing tennis because it's always about

1035
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,190
winning or losing and I just hated that

1036
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,840
I don't mind competing against myself

1037
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,510
but competing against other people's

1038
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,730
stresses me out so what are other ways

1039
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,790
you compete against yourself oh you know

1040
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:02,400
just like okay it just works for example

1041
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:04,080
like the 90-day journey like I want to

1042
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,640
hit this number how do I get there how

1043
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,380
do I get there faster like what kind you

1044
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,510
like that kind of stuff or like you know

1045
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,040
I lifted this much yesterday how much

1046
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,990
can I squat today like that kind of

1047
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,980
stuff but yeah when in computer why

1048
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:18,780
don't you want to like I mean like you

1049
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,270
were you valedictorian no were you

1050
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:33,300
striving to be of course yeah that's the

1051
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:35,430
best is that be stuff SATs GPA I have no

1052
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,770
idea yeah we weren't close clearly yeah

1053
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:40,260
not even close

1054
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,340
oh wow wouldn't it because I would have

1055
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,070
assumed you're just incredibly

1056
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,810
competitive yeah I think I I don't know

1057
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:48,120
why I said that a lot of things about

1058
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:52,110
you baby yeah I think I am

1059
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:54,630
but I don't like you don't like making

1060
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:59,250
other people lose basically no no and I

1061
00:40:54,630 --> 00:41:00,780
don't like losing you do like board

1062
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:04,170
games or stuff like that

1063
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,820
let them out a little bit not too much

1064
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,190
not in Portuguese I think it has to do

1065
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,990
with like work and stuff like that work

1066
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,710
or like beating sales from last year and

1067
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,410
you know stuff like that

1068
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,580
okay yeah I'm just confirming with the

1069
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,410
gentleman that back because he sat up

1070
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,310
straight when we started like talking

1071
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,310
about you being competitive

1072
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,420
you got another question here from

1073
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,970
Potter freak tips on always staying

1074
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,520
motivated when working out okay you get

1075
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,530
this a lot oh yeah important one here's

1076
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,090
the thing you're not motivated if you

1077
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:42,360
don't like what you're doing so like

1078
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:44,580
pick a workout that's fun so I love

1079
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,440
dancing I love Pilates like when I go to

1080
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:49,320
my workout it feels like a treat not a

1081
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,600
chore so that's number one

1082
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,090
secondly maybe have an accountability

1083
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,580
partner like a friend a sister boyfriend

1084
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:58,800
whoever do it with you so now it becomes

1085
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,390
like a date so that makes it fun again

1086
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,850
it's all about finding the joy in

1087
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:05,550
working out and that to me is the secret

1088
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:07,440
and also finding something that you can

1089
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,790
constantly get better at something that

1090
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,380
you can increase your skill in because

1091
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,300
it makes it exciting to come back me

1092
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,920
like oh can I do this handstand am I a

1093
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,240
little straighter did I run like 1

1094
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,640
second faster than last time

1095
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,230
like I think that's incredible yeah

1096
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,080
having having being able to see

1097
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:25,500
improvement yes is is very addicting

1098
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,330
yeah it is progress is addictive but to

1099
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,250
counter that a lot of people don't

1100
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,560
improve very quickly and they get bored

1101
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,900
or they get there just not patient or

1102
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,760
you know I think that's also evil yeah

1103
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,760
most people if they don't stop seeing

1104
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,290
results they just quit right so then it

1105
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,690
happens a lot for a lot of people it

1106
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:44,340
does and that's why I love doing all

1107
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,740
sorts of workouts so sometimes we were

1108
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,940
like oh why do you do yoga and Pilates

1109
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,280
and dancing and all this other stuff

1110
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,630
it's because I like to it would be so

1111
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,670
boring if I just did one thing all the

1112
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,900
time but I think you just gonna find

1113
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,730
that level for you that makes it

1114
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,040
exciting and interesting so whether

1115
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:00,810
that's the right variety or increasing

1116
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,310
your skill level just find that thing

1117
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,850
that keeps you

1118
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:08,270
coming back mm-hmm yeah okay well we got

1119
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:10,730
one more here from Daniella she asks if

1120
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,860
I want to get in better shape not just

1121
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:17,630
losing weight should I focus more on

1122
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:21,140
workouts or on eating so in my

1123
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:23,180
experience she waits you wonder she

1124
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,770
better shape better workout right not

1125
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:28,130
just losing weight just better shamp by

1126
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:29,450
working out or eating okay so I guess we

1127
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,980
don't know what she means by shape like

1128
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,870
physical shape or just like healthy fit

1129
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:37,640
shape I'm assuming she means like a

1130
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:41,990
six-pack okay leaner so if we're talking

1131
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:44,990
about leaner you know I think when

1132
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:47,480
people say that abs are made in the

1133
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,970
kitchen have you guys heard that it's

1134
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,820
because all of us have a six-pack is no

1135
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,110
it's covered by a layer of fat so in

1136
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,210
order to get rid of that fat it's gonna

1137
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:59,030
be a lot of cardio a lot of hit workouts

1138
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,830
and then of course um a creating that

1139
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:03,080
calorie deficit so that you can start

1140
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:04,580
losing the fat on your body for me and

1141
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,740
my experience especially on this 90-day

1142
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,300
journey a lot of it was food because

1143
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,520
I've always been working out I'll enjoy

1144
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:14,480
working out but the food I had always

1145
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,580
been overeating so focusing on the food

1146
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,760
I do a lot of lean protein along with

1147
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,410
vegetables cauliflower everything that's

1148
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,500
how I replace my rice with and that's

1149
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,750
helped a lot I know I know I know

1150
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:30,080
cauliflower is great though I take a

1151
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:34,580
cauliflower cauliflower polka yesterday

1152
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:36,410
for sweet Finn oh my god you have to try

1153
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,980
it you have to actually I mean I would

1154
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:40,190
try it

1155
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:42,620
but I've tried the cauliflower rice and

1156
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:47,720
from where uh well I mean I've had

1157
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:48,890
pre-made ones I okay and you I mean the

1158
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,080
thing is if you want right it's not

1159
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,610
right it's not it's it's something it's

1160
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,440
definitely something you know I will

1161
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:56,240
replace rice dish in Clarke rice no

1162
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,530
you're right it's just cauliflower just

1163
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,890
cut yum nice

1164
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:03,050
minced cauliflower it's not bad as a I

1165
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,910
like it I think I think cauliflower rice

1166
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:07,640
helped me on my journey yeah yeah yeah

1167
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:10,670
no I love rice but I can really easily

1168
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,190
overeat that and it bloats me mm-hmm

1169
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:14,870
unfortunately as an Asian yeah yeah so

1170
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:17,150
basically saying having a

1171
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:20,060
better diet a diet is more important to

1172
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:22,850
get apps and it is to get well I mean

1173
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:24,260
everyone has abs to get rid of the layer

1174
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,850
of fat it's not just working on it's

1175
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,650
your diet it's it yeah it's both

1176
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,240
it's totally both because ironically

1177
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,820
though couldn't you just not workout and

1178
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,380
just starve yourself and you would get

1179
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:35,660
abs but you'd probably die but I mean

1180
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:40,150
like over time you see your abs right

1181
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:40,150
like that's like starving people right

1182
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,960
there and you'll see ribs you know so

1183
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:51,290
that's like it's like that's not our you

1184
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,420
know what I mean theoretically yes what

1185
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:57,530
about African children though because it

1186
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:59,980
comes it starts to eat the muscle there

1187
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:02,960
well that's what I was trying to see you

1188
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:06,020
starve yourself okay you're canceled no

1189
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,120
just kidding anyway yeah I think I've

1190
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:10,610
heard that before though yeah you need

1191
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,770
to I've I mean I know for a fact that

1192
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,870
you don't lose that you can work out all

1193
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:17,360
you want but if you're eating bad it

1194
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:20,150
doesn't really it no it totally counters

1195
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,130
it yeah it's so much easier to just eat

1196
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,530
a thousand extra calories and to burn a

1197
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:26,510
thousand extra calories just how it is

1198
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:28,190
I was always like had the issue of like

1199
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:29,270
I think I'm I don't know if you

1200
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,830
mentioned or not I don't know if we're

1201
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:33,640
similar like I've always had like this

1202
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:35,780
issue where I I like quantity of food

1203
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:38,540
like you said you like to eat a lot yeah

1204
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:41,750
like I would rather go to a place that

1205
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,940
has like a twenty dollar like 16 out

1206
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:46,000
like a big steak then to go to like a

1207
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:49,280
fancy place that's like a filet mignon

1208
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,040
Kobe beef it's like this big like the

1209
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,390
size of like a scallop I agree with you

1210
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,390
100%

1211
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:58,400
I love volume I want to fill my belly I

1212
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:00,020
think it's a issue that I like the

1213
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,700
feeling of feeling full me too

1214
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,740
that's why it's dangerous though guys

1215
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,210
don't you think because I know I know I

1216
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,650
can stop like a lot of times I'll go to

1217
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,260
dinner have a appetizers and be like I'm

1218
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:11,540
good but I'll keep going because you're

1219
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,740
so high achieving you just keep going

1220
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,230
you know I don't like to waste either

1221
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:16,720
he's also the Asian in you right now you

1222
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:20,710
guys are going with the generic brand

1223
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:24,590
what when the filet mignon is name brand

1224
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:25,349
what we want to save money that's what

1225
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,450
I'm saving

1226
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:29,609
okay when you go to buffets uh-huh what

1227
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:31,710
did your parents used to tell you how to

1228
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:32,460
eat go to the get the expensive stuff

1229
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,769
yeah

1230
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,749
don't touch the rice crab legs only yeah

1231
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:39,509
yeah yeah they would yell at me if I

1232
00:47:36,749 --> 00:47:41,160
want to talk but I still get rice like a

1233
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:43,559
buffet that's how much I like rice it's

1234
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,269

1235
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:46,890
I love brown rice though like I

1236
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:47,339
naturally like brown rice is chewy and

1237
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,380
good

1238
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:52,549

to lose weight - it is it is and we
