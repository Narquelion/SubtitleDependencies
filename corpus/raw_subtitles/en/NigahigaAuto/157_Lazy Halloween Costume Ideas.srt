00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
hey guys so halloween is coming up fast

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,810
if you're one of those lazy

3
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,279
procrastinators that don't have a

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,410
Halloween costume yet or at least an

5
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,750
idea I made this video just for you and

6
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,309
for myself because I also don't have a

7
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,599
costume or an idea yet or if you're

8
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,340
anything like me and you just don't like

9
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,020
dressing up I know I know party pooper

10
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,279
poop but I mean come on you in a

11
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,660
dressing up too if you had to dress up

12
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,660
as much as I do throughout the year I

13
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,019
just notice that I did not do my hair

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,279
well I already shot the beginnings I'm

15
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,300
not gonna do it now see what I mean and

16
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,800
that's why I came up with a bunch of

17
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,269
costume ideas that require little to no

18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,219
effort or money to get done maybe I'll

19
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,600
be the best costume idea at the time it

20
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,800
takes to get done to possibility of

21
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,180
getting a chuckle out of it ratio is

22
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,530
pretty good I mean some people are lucky

23
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,850
they have certain features that allows

24
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,350
them to come up with even better costume

25
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,879
ideas but even less effort like my

26
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,870
friend Greg for example I'm not sure

27
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,250
what it is but there's something about

28
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,989
his look that just allows him to be so

29
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,180
many different things like Mario Luigi

30
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,039

34
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,160
mustache good what no you're like them

35
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,510
because they're all drawings and

36
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,070
drawings are beautiful pictures and

37
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,270

38
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,680

40
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,799
