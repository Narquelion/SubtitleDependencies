00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,130
years I've been giving you guys the same

5
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,510
answer yes and then I get a whole bunch

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,190
of comments that are like how do you not

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,420

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,070

9
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,509

10
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,480
flattering it makes me feel good right

11
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,279
here on my boob but to be honest guys

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,900
you have no idea what it's like to date

13
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,400
someone like me there's a reason why

14
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,260
I've been single for so long I probably

15
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,789
have every single quality of the worst

16
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:34,290
boyfriend I am the opposite of romantic

17
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,910
I am the epitome of unromantic surprise

18
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,010
happy anniversary

19
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:43,620
oh thanks draw nothing but I mean most

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,180
couples give each other flowers or roses

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,090
the flowers are useless they just die

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,010
your Weezer you needed one right no in

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,620

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,370
I'm wrong or I'm right I have to win

30
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,379
every single argument even if I'm wrong

31
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,049

wrong you always want to argue with me

36
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,770
why do you always have to argue with me

37
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,570
you're being really immature right now

38
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,460

46

leave the toilet seat up hey honey could

47
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,049
you start putting the toilet seat down

48
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,439
when you're done well then could you

49
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,030
start putting it up when you're done

50
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,320
two-zero Ryan and the worst quality of

51
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,700
all and probably the main reason why I'm

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,149
still single is because I tend to

53
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:03,429
overreact

54
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:08,189
just a little bit do you have to go you

55
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:08,189
already know too well how do they fly

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,310
have a safe flight have a safe flight

57
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,620
how dare you put that kind of pressure

58
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,870
on me I love the pilot I can control the

59
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:24,280
safety of my own planet No let alone the

60
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:27,730
entire flight you know sometimes you can

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,590
be really insensitive okay so maybe I

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,090
exaggerated a little bit we all know

63
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,680
that everyone has these qualities at

64
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,209
least to a certain degree because as we

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,890
all know nobody is perfect whether you

66
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:37,930
think it's your favorite celebrity or

67
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,099
youtubers or new boyfriend or girlfriend

68
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,720
you've been dating for the past month

69
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:43,120
they're all just as messed up as you are

70
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,519
because we're all human and the trick is

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,959
not to find the perfect person or the

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,730
perfect person to find the trick anyway

73
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,500
if you're in a relationship or if you're

74
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:59,859
single no matter what I just want to let

75
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:02,200
