1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
oh sorry hey guys so I probably should

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,879
have made this video before I went

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,410
mixing in apples for about three weeks

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,330
but the reason I haven't posted in a

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,830
while is because well there's actually

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,150
three reasons why first reason is

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,620
because I recently just got back from

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,089
Singapore and Malaysia cuz I had a

9
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,250
couple of shows it looks something like

10
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,779
this the second reason is pretty obvious

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,640
I'm sure you guys can hear it but I got

12
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,400
pretty stick on that trip and it looks

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,960
something like this sorry and finally

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,149
last but not least the third reason is

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,219
because well I'm filming a movie let me

16
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,840
do another date I the last reason is

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,920
because I'm filming a movie since you

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,809
couldn't understand what I just said

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,670
that's right I'm a freaking mainstream

20
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,800
Hollywood movie star now well I mean I'm

21
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,879
not exactly the star of the film so I

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,530
guess you can't really call me a movie

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,090
store and it's not exactly mainstream

24
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,500
because it's an independent film and

25
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,570
it's not even shot in Hollywood it's

26
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,640
shot in downtown LA but it's still a

27
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,219
real movie okay and I'm still a real

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,719
movie star okay I had so many lines it

29
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,180
looked just like this no buttons yes

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,400
they really don't want us to leave would

31
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,960
want to leave I'm a movie star this is

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
hair okay even though I'm making jokes

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,290
right now it's true I really have been

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
working on a movie and I'm not gonna lie

35
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,900
it's been a little tough for me and I

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,729
know a lot of you guys think that I'm a

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,439
good actor but acting in a movie is

38
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,000
completely different from what I do here

39
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,619
especially since the movie I'm doing is

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,350
actually not even a comedy it's actually

41
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,100
a thriller slash oror slash I don't know

42
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,299
what it is I didn't read the script

43
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,310
point that I'm trying to tell you guys

44
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,659
is that I'm a movie star now I'm famous

45
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,670
I don't have time to be doing these

46
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,659
silly amateur non movie videos anymore

47
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,520
I'm moving on I'm moving on see I'm

48
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,079
funny too I'm so funny look Hollywood

49
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,460
called and they want a new movie star

50
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,990
okay well maybe they haven't called yet

51
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,759
but they're going to because I have

52
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,320
everything it takes I'm going to be the

53
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,119
next movie star here's all the reasons

54
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,750
why I should be the next movie star I

55
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,750
can cry on demand

56
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:02,520
I can't stand the paparazzi oh please no

57
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,409
no no photos today please no photos I

58
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,880
have an agent that I always yell at look

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,060
other clothes are Ginny Garner which

96
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,370
some of you might know from the movie

97
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,870
project Almanac a huge studio film she

98
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,609
knows exactly what it's like to be a

99
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,780
movie star and she'll tell you how great

100
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:37,070
I've been oh hey

101
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,530
Ginny can ask you a question right uh

102
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,959
yeah sure um okay so on a scale from 9

103
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,209
to 10 how great of a movie star actor

104
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,200
would you say that I am uh you only gave

105
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,230
me two options

106
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,930
yeah 9 to 10 so what would you rate me

107
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,269
uh I mean I guess I would give you a

108
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,489
nine but again I only have two options

109
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:57,440
yeah not 9 as in mind being the highest

110
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:59,120
like thousand nine being like the lowest

111
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,070
out of the cheap options at you you know

112
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,109
that's still a 90% that's an A like I

113
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,180
respect Jimmy but like she wasn't the

114
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,829
stars to her a project Almanac if she

115
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,850
were you know she would've gave me a 10

116
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,560
cuz she would have known better

117
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,540
