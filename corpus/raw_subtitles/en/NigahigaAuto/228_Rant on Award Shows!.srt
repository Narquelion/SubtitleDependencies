nominated for what a shorty award

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,370
creator of the decade you know I always

37
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,280
thought that if you worked hard enough

38
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:56,720
you really put your heart no matter what

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:59,090

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,580

42
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,599

streamys yeah that's that that's the one

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,519
that really matters what was i nominated

47
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:20,690
nope and that's why I don't even feel

48
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:23,540
like doing this vlog right now cuz that

49
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,250
cutaway was so damn long and boring it

50
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,750
sucked all the energy out of me really

51
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,280
don't know when to stop this is going on

52
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,990
way too long hey guys so if it isn't

53
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,120
obvious you know I was being sarcastic

54
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,220
just a little bit I really do not care

55
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,389
about winning some shorty award no fans

56
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,770
to show you a word I'm not sure I like

57
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,300
don't shade or anything I'm just that's

58
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,800
not one of the reasons why I do YouTube

59
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,390
and don't get me wrong I actually really

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,890
appreciate that a lot of you guys didn't

61
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,330
care that I didn't nominated for this

62
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,160
award it was actually a lot of you

63
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,600
whatever really angry about its knowing

64
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,669
how bad you guys wanted me to win this

65
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,200
award already is that's more valuable

66
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,880
than the award so I mean I'm not gonna

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,229
lie I'm still human like it's always

68
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,520
nice to give win Oh award or be

69
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,080
recognized for something you know it's

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,090
human nature but after a certain point

71
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,680
of you know winning these awards or

72
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,060
being nominated are going to the award

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,360
shows themselves you kind of get to a

74
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,560
point where you're kind of ah it's gonna

75
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,389
sound that don't that you don't

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,680
appreciate it anymore it's just that you

77
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:11,510
get to a point where you kind of realize

78
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,630
like all these awards and award shows

79
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,100
are pretty pointless and I'll rather bet

80
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,960
I just have to go and say that I wanted

81
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,580
to make this video a long time ago years

82
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,710
but I never did for two main reasons

83
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,510
reason number one I did not want to

84
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,370
appear bitter I was actually waiting for

85
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,810
the opportunity where I would win one of

86
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,400
these awards so I could make this video

87
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,139
and not seem like I'm being bidders

88
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,700
right now I'm probably coming across as

89
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,740
somebody who's just being a bitter sore

90
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,110
loser not the reason guys I don't care

91
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,000
that I didn't win no but seriously I was

92
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,010
gonna wait until I want an award to do

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,840
this video but in the form of a speech

94
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,770
this is gonna be pretty much my award

95
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,020
speech good thing I did

96
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,729
it wouldn't have been smart to do you'll

97
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,440
see why second reason I never made this

98
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:49,819
video up until now is because let's be

99
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,009
real there's a lot of powerful people

100
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:53,240
and politics that goes you know behind

101
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:54,800
the scenes when it comes to

102
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,110
entertainment these particle people they

103
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,879
they create and run these award shows

104
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,710
and the reason why I'm finally speaking

105
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,300
up right now is because I think I'm

106
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,400
finally in a place in my career where I

107
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,919
don't really care that much not that I

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,710
don't care about my career but I don't

109
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,690
care as much it's been a process over

110
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,490
like two three years where I I decided

111
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,169
I'm not gonna go through the BS just to

112
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,550
make my career but luckily I don't know

113
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:18,409
how a lot of you guys have still stuck

114
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,389
around which that's why I'm so

115
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:22,280
appreciative that you guys still watch

116
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,840
and then you guys still want me to win

117
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,159
these random awards I'm just finally

118
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,630
comfortable enough to a place where I

119
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,220
feel like I can speak my mind and not

120
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,479
worry about the consequences and I think

121
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,919
it kind of shows in the videos I've been

122
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,569
making recently like the recent rear

123
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,400
ioan video or like the how to get views

124
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:35,539
on YouTube they're very critical on

125
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,099
YouTube and that's not something I

126
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:38,479
normally would have spoke out on because

127
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:39,740
it's so controversial and I think a lot

128
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,060
of you guys who've been around with me

129
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,379
long you don't know that I'm not the

130
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,240
kind of person to go out and start

131
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,159
controversy or be a part of any drama

132
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,569
but I'm just calling it as I see it you

133
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:49,610
know I'm just speaking my mind whereas

134
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,780
Oprah would say speaking my truth I

135
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,400
don't know if that's correct I saw

136
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,810
someone caught it on Facebook I don't

137
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,919
watch those stupid Awards just these

138
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,199
things like that they get me into

139
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:58,759
trouble anyway back to the topic right

140
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,930
after these messages I think I said it a

141
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,729
few times already but I personally

142
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,990
believe that you know these awards these

143
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:05,060
award shows are kind of part of this

144
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,289
like for won these award shows that you

145
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,000
know we all watch I don't want to say

146
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:09,740
that they're fake it's super misleading

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,360
and I started finally going to these

148
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,039
when I was like 10 years ago back in

149
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,020
high school I was shocked at what these

150
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,580
shows really are like during the scene

151
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,590
this award shows were honest I think

152
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,419
people would not care about them nearly

153
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,979
as much they'd just be like this is just

154
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:23,960
for promotion again I'm facing a lot

155
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,919
it's off my own personal experiences it

156
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,810
might not be the same for other people

157
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,340
also heard a lot of things from friends

158
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,380
who told me their stories as well so I

159
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,389
think it's a pretty commonly known thing

160
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,009
in our industry but the public doesn't

161
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,539
ever get to see not even talking about

162
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,250
the award shows themselves the real

163
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,259
important things happen even before the

164
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,909
award show happens it's easier if I just

165
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,840
show you guys let me just show you some

166
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,880
of the things that happens behind the

167
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:51,300
scenes of these award shows and you can

168
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:53,340
decide you know

169
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,419
your hand makeup should be there on to

170
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,919
third in your wardrobe we'll be there

171
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,300
shortly after noon well I'm pretty much

172
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,560
ready all right oh they helped you

173
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,620
already know I just did it myself okay

yeah they'll be there 2:30 okay uh how

175
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,229

176
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,159

178
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,729
wait what yeah her grandma got sick so

179
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,990
she's not gonna be able to make it why

180
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,970
didn't you say something earlier do you

181
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,710
at least have a backup no I just figured

182
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,599

check it your email or okay so maybe

232
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,990
these things didn't exactly happen that

233
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,820
way but I'm just trying to show you an

234
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,020
idea and to be honest it's not that far

235
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,400
wrong and I'm just speaking from my

236
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,690
point of view of things I've witnessed

237
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,740
other creators who's been around the

238
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,420
block long you know if they might not

239
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,490
say it publicly but they know what I'm

240
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,490
talking about they know the game oh they

241
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,800
know Z that's them meeting me up about

242
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,480
the game because sorry guys I put some

243
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,320
sorry and I know it might seem strange

244
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,340
from the outside

245
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,680
like why would people do these things

246
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,640
through this it works this is the BS I

247
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,140
was talking about that I don't like

248
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,550
doing but to be honest if I really

249
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,570
wanted to help my career and if you're

250
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,040
an entertainment you want to help your

251
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,110
career you should be doing these things

252
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,880
that's why so many creators and actors

253
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,230
who hate doing these things still do it

254
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,550
because they have to and it's not

255
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,900
anyone's fault they have to do it to

256
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,220
stay relevant again I have nothing

257
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,050
against these award shows I think it's

258
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,610
great entertainment but that's it where

259
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,680
I have an issue with this is that we as

260
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,240
a society value these awards so much

261
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,470
more than just entertainment some of

262
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,180
these awards we treat it like it's an

263
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,530
integral part of our society take the

264
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,090
Oscars for example remember the whole

265
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,470
hashtag oscarssowhite

266
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,670
controversy remember that we're a bunch

267
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,200
of people even other actors and

268
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,030
celebrities were saying like you know

269
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,470
the Oscars are racist because there's so

270
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,180
many white people winning and not enough

271
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,980
you know people other misses and being a

272
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,180
minority being Asian myself I always

273
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,800
thought you know I completely get why

274
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,000
people are upset but I always thought

275
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,350
like this happens every year nothing

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,460
gets changed you know there's what's the

277
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,020
solution and when I really thought about

278
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,520
it my point of view was always if you

279
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,020
really think the Oscars are racist then

280
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,190
why are you watching them why are you

281
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,330
supporting it there are all these

282
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,800
celebrities that are speaking out

283
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,570
against the Oscars seeing the asean

284
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,040
racist ills showing up to the oscars

285
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,570
hoping to win one you guys want to

286
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,250
change then make that change and stop

287
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,080
doing this silly piece of metal more

288
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,340
value than it really deserve we are the

289
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,960
reason the Oscars are valium we don't

290
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,640
need the officers or any award show to

291
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,230
tell us what's good and what isn't we

292
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,910
can decide that for ourselves by caring

293
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,350
so much about these awards we're just

294
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,910
giving them more power for example all

295
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,680
the people who are Leonardo DiCaprio

296
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,510
fans and we're so upset that he'd never

297
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,400
won in Austin does why without an Oscar

298
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,840
Leonardo DiCaprio is not a great actor

299
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
he's not one of the best just because he

300
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,200
has an Oscar now we're suddenly like

301
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,520
okay now he's one of the best doesn't

302
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
make any sense it's like letting a whole

303
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,880
group of other people decide all our

304
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,310
opinions for us is if we can't do that

305
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,350
ourselves I'm sorry getting mad I don't

306
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,270
know why we are taught the known Oscar

307
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,650
is this incredibly valuable prestigious

308
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,480
award and I know a lot of people are

309
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,220
gonna say oh yeah it is valuable

310
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,900
prestigious because just like having one

311
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,640
you make millions more as an actor well

312
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,200
again yes that's because we were taught

313
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,370
that it is worth this money in the grand

314
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,960
scheme of things that if you really

315
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,760
break it down is this little trophy

316
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,560
really that great if the Oscars were

317
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,060
invented today and you know all the same

318
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,310
actors all the same movies were all

319
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,420
nominated nobody would care who won the

320
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,010
celebrities probably wouldn't even show

321
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,930
up if you gave a little kid who has no

322
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,360
knowledge of the Oscars a choice between

323
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,790
a Oscar statue or a pigeon spinner

324
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,290
chances are you applied to this

325
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,970
without being taught how valuable an

326
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,740
award is it's meaningless even by

327
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,540
complaining about it so much you're

328
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,890
showing how much it matters how much you

329
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,390
care you're just giving more power to

330
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,560
the award that's your fault anything is

331
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,910
the people in charge of these awards

332
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,110
just become more powerful you might not

333
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,190
think it affects you but it does because

334
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,200
if you control something that

335
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,910
celebrities want you have control over a

336
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,870
lot of Kievan all that power goes all

337
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,280
the way back to the top right now

338
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,450
believe it or not the same thing is

339
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,530
happening with these internet award and

340
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,000
then because I was there to see it for

341
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,680
the very beginning it's just so clear

342
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,880
and brilliant actually how it happened I

343
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,200
didn't make something value you can't

344
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,340
make something valuable without people

345
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,630
paying attention how do you get people's

346
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,040
attention celebrities do you get

347
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,150
celebrities to be a part of it there he

348
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,350
goes tell them you want to give them

349
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,850
something to show them how great they

350
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,530
are once you get a few big celebs there

351
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,700
then all the other smaller ones join in

352
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,230
too because they want to be a part of

353
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,460
whatever these bigger celebrities are

354
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,020
doing once all of the celebrities care

355
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,950
about it so do all their fans and I'm

356
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,150
sure you can see where I'm going with

357
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,560
this it just keeps spreading let's be

358
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,330
real you know celebrities come together

359
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,370
and collectively say something about

360
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,960
anything it becomes a fad that's just

361
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,250
how our society works because nobody

362
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,870
thinks for themselves including myself

363
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,580
we like to be told what to think we just

364
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,960
accept what we're being taught oh I'm

365
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,400
sorry guys I haven't made a ran video

366
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,480
like this in a long time probably set up

367
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,100
a bunch of stuff I shouldn't be saying

368
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,810
publicly but you know whoops

369
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,520
overall what I'm really trying to say is

370
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,770
whether it's a shorty award a Streamy

371
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,630
award an Oscar even is not an award and

372
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,040
all just think for yourself don't just

373
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,510
believe everything you're being done

374
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,830
including everything I'm saying to you

375
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,150
right now as always that's why that's

376
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,410
the motto out of the vine again this is

377
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,880
just my opinion and probably a very

378
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,960
unpopular one I'm just trying to give a

379
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,310
different point of view it doesn't mean

380
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,870
it's right it says for you guys to

381
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,520
decide I go for this video wasn't just

382
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,960
to change your mind about award shows it

383
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,400
was at the very least just to get people

384
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,720
to think for themselves that's the real

385
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,820
thing I wanted to say before you just

386
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,290
believe what you're being taught think

387
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:02,780
twice about I was really getting into it

388
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,940
at that time see and I swear my silence

389
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,600
did but I'm not even texting this person

390
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,600
back and they keep

391
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:17,160
as I was saying you know my goal was to

392
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:20,940
get people to think for themselves and

393
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,680
but you know the thing is sometimes

394
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,680
celebrities are popular for a reason you

395
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,199
know like there's still some validity to

396
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,600
what to what's behind you know someone's

397
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:36,519
popularity so first sometimes maybe you

398
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,740
should just listen to just maybe

399
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:44,599
sometimes

400
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:44,599
