where normally we're supposed to be

59
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,170
how's life been this super general but

60
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:34,760
that's blue like another one actually

61
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:37,250
yeah dude it's been crazy not what I

62
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,840
expected at all it's what were you

63
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,180
expecting to find a job for one Oh

64
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,019
instantly right I didn't think it's

65
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,389
gonna be this hard

66
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:46,219
right right right well that's why you

67
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:48,530
were using this podcast see another

68
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:50,269
thing in sponsorships shot needs a job

69
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,069
if you're in the Sacramento area and

70
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,269
you're looking for an engineer well I

71
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:55,069
don't know what if that's what you want

72
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:58,250
but yeah we're looking for an engineer

73
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:59,599
yeah trying to do engineering but do all

74
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,989
you engineers out there with engineering

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,159
degrees you might really do this but if

76
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:05,989
you're in school right now get an

77
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,879
internship because that thing means a

78
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,530
lot when you were in school did you

79
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,659
actually think about that did you

80
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:15,379
actually like they had the option to

81
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:16,939
intern I did but I had a lot of smarter

82
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,409
people with my class so they got the

83
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,030
internships I wasn't gonna get any you

84
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:21,919
actually tried though oh yeah I tried I

85
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,269
see okay so it's really important

86
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,650
because from what you were telling me

87
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,290
like what were you saying about the

88
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,259
issues with that you need experience

89
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,870
they arrived on experience but they

90
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:34,370
don't really they want to spend the

91
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,259
least amount of time to train you to get

92
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,639
you a two-speed which makes sense for a

93
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,780
business aspect you know cuz they don't

94
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,189
want to spend a whole bunch of time

95
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,229
trying to teach you from the ground up

96
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:45,530
of right how to do stuff they want you

97
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:47,540
to know kind of what the industry is

98
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,639
especially in your type of field right

99
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,530
cuz I mean so it's been like six months

100
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,689
yeah almost I think yeah I mean more

101
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,370
than I'm not sure it's about six months

102
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,349
yeah and you've been non-stop like

103
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,689
applying and reaching out to people and

104
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:04,729
it always comes down to experience yeah

105
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:06,709
and location - oh really because if I

106
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:08,930
was like in maybe like the one of the

107
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,609
main cities then I would have more

108
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,189
options to choose from more

109
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:15,109
opportunities more companies right

110
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:17,269
Sacramento is kind of like a small kind

111
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:20,060
of town it's a city but not really a

112
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:23,840
city it's more like a big town in my

113
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,650
opinion so well huh it's it's really

114
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,470
tough

115
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,790
do you think that um you know obviously

116
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,410
I thought I won't point something you

117
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,810
said that you met a fan or something

118
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,770
like that and their mom kind of like you

119
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,710
hooked you up with an interview I

120
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,750
thought that was like you got a job or a

121
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,699
see the thing that I run into a lot is

122
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,530
that a lot of them like me as a person

123
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:44,449
right and they really enjoy like my

124
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,900
personality is what they tell me but I

125
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:49,970
don't have the experience to be able to

126
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,740
you know hit it home with ya the

127
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,300
department's yeah because they're you

128
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,889
think it'd also be like wow this guy is

129
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,289
fresh out of college this fresh in his

130
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:59,030
mind he has interned for this company

131
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:01,280
why would they pick somebody who's not

132
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,530
exactly right so but the weird thing is

133
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,830
like if you can if you're open to doing

134
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,030
an internship yeah like a non-paid one

135
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,530
they're if they're not letting you do

136
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,240
that then like how are you ever going to

137
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,470
experience you know I mean well they're

138
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,169
for one there's a difference between

139
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,510
internships and volunteer tips are kind

140
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,620
of they're more kind of funded by like

141
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,389
the government uh-huh

142
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,740
so like there's a lot of legal stuff

143
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,020
that kind of go into it so you need to

144
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,130
be part of school still taught it get an

145
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,660
internship and most places aren't as

146
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,930
open to giving volunteer opportunities

147
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,240
right so you know there's that old dude

148
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,250
yeah well I mean maybe like like I said

149
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,430
that we should use this anyone in

150
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,870
Sacramento or in the Northern

151
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,419
Californian sac because it would be nice

152
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,280
in sac yeah Sacramento I'll commute to

153
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:50,060
San Francisco two-hour drive but you

154
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:53,300
want to volunteer you know Shawn needs

155
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,190
an engineering job well I guess would

156
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,470
you go back to like school since you

157
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,570
said internships are where you can go is

158
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,580
that is that a potential possibility for

159
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,949
you honestly yeah I've been considering

160
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,970
it a lot if well right now I'm in the

161
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:09,560
process of maybe getting a job but think

162
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,570
you're on a questionable just growing

163
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,599
yeah so I'm just hoping right but if it

164
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,070
doesn't fall it doesn't if it doesn't

165
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,530
work out then yeah I'm thinking about

166
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,080
going back to school okay well wouldn't

167
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,060
it be really are you taking the same

168
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,449
classes like knock out change

169
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,120
oh I see okay just pull up your old

170
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:30,229
report from some yeah but it's like I

171
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,620
was thinking about going a different

172
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:35,360
route maybe huh because I don't know I

173
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,909
took I took mechanical engineering

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,600
because it's the most broad engineering

175
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:41,660
degree that

176
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,720
you cover all bases of engineering to do

177
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,910
something more specific yeah I like I

178
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,800
like graphics okay it's kind of why I

179
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,150
was doing editing here yeah but I

180
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,340
enjoyed doing graphics and stuff so

181
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,960
thank you stuff you could use as say

182
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,730
that's like experience I've been trying

183
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,790
right you could I've been crying that

184
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,090
they do allow some to cross over from

185
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,080
like graphic design into CAD designing

186
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,680
is what they call it uh-huh

187
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,390
and it's just it's pretty similar except

188
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,420
you need to know some technical fields

189
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,920
about it you're like building like you

190
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,870
know little projects little mechanical

191
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,810
things or like architecture or that kind

192
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,270
of stuff so there is some crossover but

193
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,290
they would rather you learn within the

194
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,420
industry right right right

195
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:27,380
so it's a little tough so anyway your

196
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:29,000
advice to kids is yeah do the internship

197
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,290
get the internship because it makes a

198
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,240
big difference it makes a huge

199
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,040
difference okay well that's good to know

200
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,290
it makes a really big difference no

201
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,270
matter what engineering you're in get an

202
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,430
internship mm-hmm but you are open to

203
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,480
volunteering free yeah exactly all right

204
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,220
I don't see why people wouldn't want

205
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,290
that though you know like it doesn't

206
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,760
harm them does it that's what I love you

207
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,500
and that's what I think it might harm

208
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,390
because then he could be a potential

209
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,580
hindrance yeah because it's considered

210
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,920
volunteer work so you're not like oh I'm

211
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,810
like die hard for this company you know

212
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,730
it's like I'm giving them my spare time

213
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,050
I'm you know right so they want people

214
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,230
they probably want people who are like

215
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,780
invested into it know that oh they want

216
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,280
to be there there is a difference with

217
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,050
each company too though some are more

218
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,550
like family oriented were some are more

219
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,140
blue-collar you know and so like the

220
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,030
blue-collar ones just want experience

221
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,830
yeah where they're not gonna hook you up

222
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,700
yeah that one might be like oh he's just

223
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,260
a cool guy

224
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,200
unless you have connections within the

225
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,540
company on it okay that's another thing

226
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,380
if if you can make connections to that's

227
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,060
your another way in

228
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,950
Oh hundred percent connections are

229
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,600
everything that's how like a lot of

230
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,100
things work nowadays yes even then

231
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,110
especially in like the entertainment

232
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,050
industry that is how it works yeah from

233
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,430
what I hear at least like half the time

234
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,530
you know we need to open casting calls

235
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,969
for movies and stuff like that they

236
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,289
already know who they want they're just

237
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,030
doing it for the sake and they'll bring

238
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,310
in like some Asians and some color and

239
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,839
you know just to say like oh we casted

240
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,310
and this is just the best person but

241
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,750
they already knew who they wanted hmm

242
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,950
it's all about connections that's why

243
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:56,300
it's important to

244
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:58,130
nice introvert extroverted person like

245
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,190
me I think you too actually I don't know

246
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,770
if you're introverted I am I'm not good

247
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,250
at networking I'm so introverted right

248
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,780
yeah right um I think I can

249
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,670
I can't label myself as introvert

250
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,370
extrovert I think I'm a percentage

251
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:16,760
mm-hmm I think I'm like do both I think

252
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,280
I'm like 35% extroverted and the rest is

253
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,520
introvert it's not like yeah one or the

254
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,140
other

255
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,760
yeah kind of like a CD it depends on the

256
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,490
situation and who I'm surrounded with

257
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,840
hmm see we're doing we're giving a

258
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,280
business class right now and see what

internship number two be a little

261

extroverted learn how to network that is

262
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,600
the most important getting connections

263
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,300

actually really true that'll ruin

267
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,610
people's lives holidays yeah or private

268
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,080
your Twitter right anything anything

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,410
that's going online you just have to be

270
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,940
more conscious like the whole receivers

but it was it was like a they basically

306
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:37,130
wanted my technical aspect of opinion of

307
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:39,590
what they're doing and that was the job

308
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,120
I wasn't like a meeting greed no it

309
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:45,020

oh so um I just yeah are you allowed to

311
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,440
discuss it I can say okay I'm pretty

312
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,110
sure I mean I didn't need to post

313
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,350
anything but you sign an NDA what is

314
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,160
that good then I think you'd be fine no

315
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,770
I think I'm fine

316
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,210
uh-huh but basically uh are you guys

317
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,330
familiar with SK too

318
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:05,120
just out of curiosity okay area ii south

319
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,370
korea it's it's a beauty brand like for

320
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,320
like skincare type of stuff i have heard

321
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:14,630
of that it's a very popular Asian brand

322
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:16,730
that's in Singapore no Japan maybe I

323
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,980
didn't hear about that okay go ahead

324
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,350
honestly I'm probably the worst person

325
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,330
to speak about this sorry SK 2 but if

326
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:27,770
you guys are watching you sorry but in

327
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:30,410
sponsors but yeah they were doing a

328
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:33,080
bunch of pops pop ups around around

329
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,870
everywhere and the whole the entire

330
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,280
thing was basically trying to have a

331
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,470
more interactive environment while

332
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,720
learning about the product so they did

333
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,570
this AR space artificial reality and

334
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,450
basically you take your phone and using

335
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,740
the video it like replaces a lot of like

336
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,150
the walls and stuff and like you see

337
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,590
like cool effects like coming out at the

338
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,080
walls or like you'll see bubbles popping

339
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:57,110
around everywhere so that's pretty cool

340
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,460
and then like as you go and like it's

341
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,450
kind of like a fun experience like it's

342
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,020
kind of like a playground with your

343
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:06,050
phone and and that's what so what did

344
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,600
you do they've basically just filmed me

345
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,920
mari and was just going through the

346
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,080
throughout the space and experience

347
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,150
everything every single room learning

348
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,800
about what the whole product was about

349
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,990
and then at the end they do like a

350
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,010
facial scan and it tells you like your

351
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,949
skin age

352
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:23,120
oh and then from that they'll recommend

353
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:27,170
you like what product you should use

354
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,370
yeah that's kind of yeah so they wanted

355
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,639
I guess they wanted people more in the

356
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,100
technical aspect I guess and to give our

357
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,240
thoughts about the space and what we

358
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,920
thought about it and give our feedback

359
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,420
so that's all that really was they just

360
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,000
filmed this going through the space and

361
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,010
then you we gave our two cents of what

362
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,870
we thought about that sounds like if I

363
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,660

I need some help but like in like you

job but it ideally in engineering yeah I

378
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,310
just what you have interest in yeah I

379
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:29,779
mean I think this kind of plays back to

380
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,899
like the whole introvert extrovert thing

381
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:37,250
mmm-hmm the whole YouTube life was like

382
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:38,930
a little I don't know the I wouldn't say

383
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,800
demanding it was just very controversial

384
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,589
for myself

385
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,790
mmm-hmm because you know we're like two

386
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:47,269
dudes from like a very small town in

387
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:50,089
Hilo Hawaii so out and you know me where

388
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:53,089
I'm more introverted so are you mm-hm

389
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:55,339
and the tension was kind of like a

390
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:57,110
stressful thing for me I can I can only

391
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:58,970
spend so much energy on it before I get

392
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,699
like stressed out about it yeah you know

393
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,290
yeah I have like capacity until I get

394
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:04,639
exhausted a lot I think a lot of

395
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,139
youtubers are like that and they have to

396
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,370
and you see it too

397
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,800
yeah through their videos everyone goes

398
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,000
through those same phases like that

399
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,680
video I made about the life of a

400
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,899
youtuber and it's always like this hype

401
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,149
and like you start blowing up and people

402
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:19,040
start surrounding you you move out to LA

403
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,600
and you get all this attention and then

404
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,069
you get exhausted you say I'll have to

405
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,870
take a break I'm too late I'm too tired

406
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:25,670
you come back once you find yourself

407
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,750
again and it's the same process and I

408
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,100
think that's what you're kind of talking

409
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,329
about is like it yeah it does get

410
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,779
exhausting mm-hm

411
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:33,490
yeah and you were in it in the beginning

412
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,439
then you went to college so you kind of

413
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,509
were out of it yeah and then you came

414
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:39,850
back and start building up again yeah

415
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:42,759
you went through it twice was my second

416
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,459
time going out yeah so for you then you

417
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:48,249
think this lifestyle fits you better

418
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:49,899
yeah and I think the biggest thing had

419
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:54,339
to do with my girlfriend as well right

420
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:56,259
because you know I don't know if I

421
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:59,439
wanted I guess I was more questionable

422
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:01,360
questionable about if I really want to

423
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:03,339
be surrounded by this whole you two-bit

424
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,439
attention while I'm trying to build like

425
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:07,209
a life right surrounding my girlfriend

426
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:09,970
and stuff because it's very serious now

427
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:12,059
obviously I would mm-hmm dropped

428
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,850
everything and moved to her right and

429
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:17,319
it's I don't know if it's a maturity

430
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,749
thing or maybe it's just like my own

431
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,850
personal quarrels of having all this

432
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:23,019
attention but I guess I don't like if I

433
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,910
have a family and stuff I don't want

434
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:27,100
them to know me as I don't want my kids

435
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,749
to know me as the YouTube guy I want to

436
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,180
do more in my life than just YouTube

437
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:32,319
kind of thing yeah you know I mean it's

438
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,660
always gonna be around people are gonna

439
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:38,470
bring it up yet over time I feel like

440
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,329
it'll chill yeah so and it just I think

441
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,980
to put more context in it like you guys

442
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:44,259
have been together for like a little

443
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,269
over two years now right and for a lot

444
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:49,230
of it was long distance yeah long

445
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:51,420
distance is tough man and and so I mean

446
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,430
there gets to a point where you're like

447
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,740
that makes you feel like oh do I really

448
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,170
want to commit to this exactly what am I

449
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,459
willing to let go and in a way it was

450
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,959
like a burden off your back because like

451
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:05,319
you said like you know you wanted to

452
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,939
build a life that isn't just viewed by

453
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,280
millions of people yeah

454
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:12,010
and so and is where you're I like my

455
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,260
privacy too yeah you know I like having

456
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,970
the split of a personal life and public

457
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,980
life so like you know I don't mind if

458
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:20,110
fans come up to me like ah I totally

459
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,699
enjoy just meeting fans in like being

460
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,079
appreciative that they've watched all of

461
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:24,730
our stuff and we're like longtime fans

462
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,799
like I still get approached to this day

463
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,010
especially in Sacramento there's a lot

464
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,750
of fans at sacrament right but I do like

465
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,929
having my personal life that's like my

466
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:37,840
my personal time my place to like you

467
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,429
know rejuvenate my brain and not be so

468
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,679
stressed out all the time I can just

469
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:43,659
enjoy my time with my girlfriend mm-hmm

470
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,280
that sounds so boring

471
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,260
yeah it is

472
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,410
don't you know what that sounds like

473
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,270
that's awesome yeah but it's it's more

474
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,250
for my son that does fit you though

475
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,610
that's like much more of like how I know

476
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,350
you

477
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,350
yeah and kind of like to yourself for

478
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,470
the most part very private yeah I guess

479
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,720
I I guess you wouldn't like that to do

480
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,120
that go out a lot and I guess it would

481
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,500
be kind of exhausting cuz I don't do it

482
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,010
I just try and that's why I stay home

483
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,340
all the time

484
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,910

crazy and they're just like oh I'm gonna

496
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,840

with you okay and the bay

549
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:54,909
I think uh-huh and we're on one of those

550
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:57,159
tram things you know the public remember

551
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:59,770
we're in San Francisco you want the

552
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,360
large like moose heart things yeah yeah

553
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,610
run in the middle of the trolley

554
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,059
patrol the trolley yeah yeah we're on

555
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,950
one of those things and basically these

556
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:13,059
these two girls recognize this and

557
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:15,510
freaked out she screamed super loud that

558
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,860
it made the train person stop mm-hmm and

559
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,120
he came running over something like

560
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,190
thinking something was wrong and then

561
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,500
the girls basically explained that oh my

562
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,630
god they're like the YouTube guys Baba

563
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,730
yeah so he's like oh okay

564
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,549
weird I mean he kept going and then

565
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,159
we're like let's get on let's get off on

566
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:34,990
the next time this is kind of weird

567
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,659
because we're standing because it was a

568
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,890
fool like it was packed they're sitting

569
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:40,750
down right in front of us and we're

570
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:44,409
hanging on to the handles right above

571
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:46,960
them and just as we're about to get off

572
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:50,530
the girl in front of me just grabs me

573
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,390
and goes I love you so much and

574
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,250
something something something and but

575
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,860
she grabbed on to me and wouldn't let me

576
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,950
go and it was like holding up everyone

577
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,630
huh and I was like I don't know how you

578
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,669
got I just feels like you just feel good

579
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,260
yeah I felt so awkward and everyone

580
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:06,850
staring and this girl's freaking out

581
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,030
grabbing on to me and I'm just like I

582
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,710
gotta go yeah just for watching nice

583
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,429
meeting you and it was just like super

584
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,899
ah yes

585
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:15,999
part especially in the beginning I was

586
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,769
years ago right yeah I was like 2010

587
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:20,559
maybe maybe or something it was a long

588
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:23,889
time ago when we weren't equipped to

589
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,990
deal with that before because at the

590
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:27,639
same time it's like this person you know

591
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,129
it might be inappropriate to a certain

592
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:32,350
degree and but it's because they love

593
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:35,559
you yeah and they really like you know

594
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,119
you really appreciate that but it's it's

595
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:38,799
such a weird thing to have to deal with

596
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,749
like you have to be like kind of mean

597
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,039
they're not mean there's like boundaries

598
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:43,539
yeah there's some boundaries that you

599
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:45,539
have to I mean it's better now

600
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:47,470
yeah people are older our fans at least

601
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,610
but like when there's a young kid you

602
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,499
don't want to like break their hearts

603
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,149
you know oh my god he's such an ass how

604
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:54,789
he like pushed me away after I hugged

605
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:56,499
him for a minute yeah I got a similar

606
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:58,360
thing in Town Square where somebody was

607
00:22:56,499 --> 00:23:00,999
hugging me and I got a little I wasn't

608
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,289
very happy it's just awkward you know

609
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:04,659
it's just like you wouldn't go up to

610
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:06,460
someone you've never met and just hugged

611
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:08,470
them yeah even if you saw them or if you

612
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,409
saw like a you know like a celebrity

613
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,700
like um Brad Pitt you know and then you

614
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:14,529
just ran up there and start hugging him

615
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,389
you would know not to do that but one

616
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:18,369
but because you're a youtuber and it's

617
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:20,230
not the same thing as I think people see

618
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:22,240
us is more approachable and more oh

619
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,710
they're relatable you know and the

620
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,690
community I know about their lives so

621
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,619
I'm allowed to talk to them like you

622
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,570
wouldn't even like you wouldn't even

623
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:30,309
think twice like oh I love them let me

624
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,759
hug them yes I know you I'm a fan I

625
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:35,559
subscribed it to like a celeb mainstream

626
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,269
celebrity you would never I think people

627
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,919
might try that but most most times

628
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:40,029
people would know like that's not the

629
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:43,450
really right thing to do

630
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:46,179
yeah and the weird thing too is like you

631
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,879
may know them but they don't know you so

632
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:51,460
it feels super awkward super strange and

633
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:54,639
the crazy thing is that it's weird for

634
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:58,019
us as guys now can you imagine like what

635
00:23:54,639 --> 00:24:02,049
is it like to be like a girl emails

636
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:04,149
right it must be so like like increment

637
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:05,590
like exponentially just so much more

638
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:07,059
strange I don't think guys would do that

639
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,350
to a girl like they especially in this

640
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,820
day and age oh yes

641
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,970
I don't think I've never seen what has

642
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:15,850
been done has it it has it like you know

643
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:18,159
like certain things like some guys just

644
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,629
don't have social cues sure act not even

645
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,850
just guys people don't have soules

646
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:25,149
recused at times and they just like

647
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,380
cross those lines and just make it super

648
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:30,130
weird like oh I paid for this

649
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,680
Griet or I came to this like VidCon and

650
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,480
I get to like you know interact with how

651
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,700
I want to interact with these people

652
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,620
that actually brings up a really that's

653
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,890
a serious topic that I've been talking

654
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:44,470
to uh not recently but we all talk about

655
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:46,240
I guess a bunch of youtubers is how you

656
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,290
know if you have like a patreon or even

657
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,790
a YouTube channel where but someone

658
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:51,910
really supports you and there is like

659
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:54,130
somebody who's a little off I know David

660
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,670
was telling me and Keena they have this

661
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,570
one fan that felt like because she has a

662
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,890
because they have like a patreon or

663
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,750
whatever they donate they feel like they

664
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,400
own you a little bit and that's where

665
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,750
you get the freaky people the people who

666
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,000
are like come to your shows and they

667
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,350
expect something yeah and you know those

668
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,700
are the super fans and it's scary like

669
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,110
you don't know what they're gonna do if

670
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,430
they feel like they're not getting if

671
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,400
they can't have you then no one should

672
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:16,720
yeah and that's and like this is kind of

673
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,160
like a dark area to go into and I know

674
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,230
you know I'm going yeah which is like

675
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,480
the the christina grimmie thing yeah I

676
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:25,390
mean I don't want mean I was terrible

677
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,890
that ruined me for awhile like I used to

678
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,180
do we used to go out to a lot I don't

679
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,220
know if before you around we used to go

680
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,020
to a lot of events and stuff after that

681
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,820
I just kind of stopped I was just like

682
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,410
this is I don't feel safe anymore and

683
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,030
like I didn't it didn't feel real

684
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,660
because I thought okay that happens to

685
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:42,130
some celebrities very rarely but to a

686
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,520
youtuber or someone I met someone it's

687
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,680
just it felt so real and it scared me

688
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,760
honest I didn't want to do events or if

689
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,670
I was gonna do it and they had to be

690
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,850
super secure I remember that yeah I'm we

691
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:57,280
all I kind of like got pushed into

692
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,690
reality you know like holy moly there's

693
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,790
like actually some crazy people who

694
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,530
would actually do that yeah and to like

695
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:04,900
perfectly nice people you know like I

696
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,000
mean I don't know the backstory but I'd

697
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,800
only got to meet her once but from

698
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,200
everybody that I was like friends with

699
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,200
and knew like they loved her yeah like

700
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,830
always spoke so highly of her and it's

701
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:21,100
just it's insane that people feel oh

702
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:23,290
because I am supporting you you're MA

703
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,940
you're a piece of my property well I

704
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,650
don't know if that's the exact case and

705
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,330
we mean the guy you know shot himself

706
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,580
after that so we don't really know

707
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:33,100
exactly I mean I don't think we know

708
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,720
just from what I've heard yeah yeah it

709
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,830
was a fan nobody can have a crazy

710
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,800
scenario

711
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,750
um yeah I mean speaking of Christina she

712
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,250
was just like there's a lot of youtubers

713
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,530
that you meet and then used to feel like

714
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,940
okay they're very nice you don't know

715
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,740
enough about them but when you met

716
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,570
Christina for the first time I remember

717
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,850
first time I met her you just instantly

718
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,550
felt like she was genuine and that's

719
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,840
something you can't just like think you

720
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:58,960
kind of fake that yeah you know and

721
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,850
that's why I was really it was tough for

722
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,380
me man I was even that closer I couldn't

723
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,880
imagine for her family or like other

724
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,800
youtubers actually were like close with

725
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,450
her but for me even just meeting her a

726
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,100
couple of times I was just like Dan this

727
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:15,730
I was I couldn't believe it yeah but um

728
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:18,880
yeah that got dark yeah super dark sure

729
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:21,670
thing is hello it brings up a good a

730
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,260
good point though about like you know I

731
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,820
think fans need to kind of realize that

732
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,310
there is a crossing point that you don't

733
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,830
cross because we're still humans you

734
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:31,330
know like right you still kind of to

735
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,280
respect us as humans we're not just like

736
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,050
some like petting zoo or so there's an

737
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,700
argument for that too when I can

738
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,800
understand their side of it

739
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,810
not that it's their sides but people say

740
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,940
like you know when you're going into the

741
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,290
public domain like you have to it comes

742
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,730
with the territory like there's a reason

743
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,340
you're getting paid more to just do

744
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,860
events and stuff like that but even then

745
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,660
I still think with that knowing that and

746
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,760
I agree with that it comes with the

747
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,410
territory yeah it's still you got to be

748
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,610
respectful to people I think some people

749
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,560
just don't realize there's there's a

750
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,870
certain line like thing I hate the most

751
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,250
and I always tell you guys his when you

752
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,390
know honestly I don't mind if they come

753
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,760
up and ask for a picture and I'll take

754
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,950
it most times if not all the time I know

755
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:12,390
where this is going but um the only time

756
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:15,040
I didn't and I was like kind of grouchy

757
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,440
when I was at a buffet I was waiting

758
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,090
over an hour and I had just sat down I

759
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,650
was watching these people right looking

760
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,240
over at me I'm in line watching these

761
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,010
people eat and like they have like I'm

762
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,110
just starving and I'm in this line for

763
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,970
like an hour as soon as I sit down I'm

764
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,360
finally like happy I'm like oh yes let's

765
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,280

769
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:37,330
another fan story I don't know I'm back

772
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,430

773
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,930
and say oh cool and nice to meet you and

774
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,120

777
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,950
messy all over my face and

778
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,270
as they're leaving they walk on like hey

779
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:56,590
could we get a picture and I'm just like

780
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:57,640
um maybe like after I'm done you know

781
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,200
and already I was just like I don't

782
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,120
really want to do this right now because

783
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,430
for one I'm hungry too I look like a

784
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,390
mess and the oh we're actually going

785
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:09,550
right now I was like oh sorry and I felt

786
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,380
so bad I still remember today this is

787
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:13,180
like years ago I felt so guilty because

788
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,300
I saw their faces go from like oh we're

789
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:18,010
big fans said oh he's a jerk but that's

790
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,450
the thing too you have to always be on -

791
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,860
yeah yeah and like the moment people

792
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,690
think like oh something's wrong with

793
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,550
Ryan like he's he's not an [ __ ] or

794
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,020
he's tired or people don't assume you're

795
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,150
tired you don't know soon you're grouchy

796
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,500
they don't assume you could have a death

797
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,760
in the family that day and you go out

798
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,410
and you say I don't want take pictures

799
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,520
they're like okay he's an [ __ ] yeah

800
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:36,040
and they're not gonna give you call

801
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,110
because all they have is as reference is

802
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,970
what you are in your videos yeah yeah

803
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,970
yeah and there have this expectation

804
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:46,210
exact um so I can't I understand that

805
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:49,030
one of you but um I forgot what we were

806
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,220
talking about just like boundaries right

807
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,720
now just countries I guess cuz like I

808
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,010
don't know I don't know about you guys

809
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,480
but I think it's kind of rude if

810
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,880
someone's made eating and you go and

811
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,810
interrupt them it is it is I feel like I

812
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,940
wouldn't do that

813
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,470
yeah but I mean generally but I guess

814
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,480
yeah I do understand that it comes with

815
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:08,260
the territory but yeah come on let us

816
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,880
eat or he is hungry sacred place yeah if

817
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,040
they're peeing in a urinal that's fine

818
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:18,160
but eating yeah that's where you draw

819
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:20,620
the line yeah come on in do not take a

820
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,650
picture take a picture it'll last longer

821
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,210
but I did feel guilty for like years I

822
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,880
think I've been through that situation -

823
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,350
yeah I thought I felt guilty I don't

824
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,080
feel guilty but then it's like I'll

825
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:34,300
never feel hungry I know well the thing

826
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,190
is - I actually appreciate people coming

827
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,380
up and asking for pictures more than

828
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,790
just trying to snipe you from far oh

829
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,020
yeah actually while you're eating

830
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,360
because then you feel like man I got to

831
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,870
eat nice and like get stuff in my mouth

832
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,790
when you see it - and it's like making I

833
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,560
go like one of those kind of phases like

834
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,420
a side for people who just are listening

835
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,950
I just made it really you know one of

836
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,600
those when you take a frame from a video

837
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,490
and your eyes are like half open ones

838
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,760
you know yeah and they post that stuff

839
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,840
and I just like okay great yeah but

840
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,520
anyway I scared

841
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,960
someone doing that one time scared

842
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,700
someone doing what exactly they're

843
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,110
sniping from like afar yeah I knew

844
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,210
they're doing it it was super obvious

845
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,500
uh-huh my entire family were like I

846
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,750
think they're trying to take a picture

847
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,880
of you I was like I know yes I do that

848
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:19,289
what I ended up doing was I made a face

849
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,400
to them a super ugly face I just like

850
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:22,330
they freaked out and they dropped their

851
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,669
phone in their leg

852
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,340
I like uh I think this is something that

853
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:29,380
a roy or guava juice and then I think

854
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,940
also Timothy DeLaGhetto does they take

855
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,460
pictures of the people taking pictures

856
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,140
of them right I think I think that's

857
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,880
funny see that comes with a risk though

858
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,590
because what if they're not taking a

859
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,510
picture yeah and you're just that cocky

860
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,789
jerk who thinks everyone's take pictures

861
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,590
of them now you can tell everyone does

862
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:46,149
yeah yeah I know the people listening

863
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:48,340
won't be able to see this but people on

864
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:50,649
video do if you're trying to get a sneak

865
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,960
picture here's here's my advice don't do

866
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:55,029
the little turtle t-rex arms yeah like

867
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,440
nobody holds their phone this close to

868
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:58,480
them and it doesn't help you get a

869
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,580
better picture the best thing you can do

870
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,399
is kind just like you know hold it like

871
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,110
just be natural yeah everyone does that

872
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,549
the t-rex they make t-rex arms they

873
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,039
bring their phone super close like right

874
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:10,270
in their chest it's so obvious yeah if

875
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,250
you want picture for one just come up

876
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,970
and ask yeah it's like when you're in

877
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,740
that position

878
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,720
you're never in that position in the

879
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,640
first place so it's already like what is

880
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,070

don't want to have to like work super

907
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:17,830
hard and just to be able to like

908
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,419
get my stuff out there and express my

909
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,240
thoughts and everything I just want the

910
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:24,970
attention some people yeah I think most

00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:29,770

I got passion in my pants yeah um

915
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:37,660
they're teachers who asks kids now oh

916
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,220
what do you want to be you know like

917
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,380
before used to be like oh astronaut

918
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,270
firefighter doctor mm-hmm one of the

919
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,490
most common things that kids want to be

920
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:49,299
now is a youtuber I've heard that yeah

921
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:52,059
and it's just like it's it's so strange

922
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:53,710
it makes sense yeah they're watching

923
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:55,750
yeah because they want like the

924
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,299
attention they want the fame they want

925
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,520
all the all the good things about it but

926
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:03,010
they don't see like how hard it takes to

927
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,510
get there yeah that's true yeah and like

928
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,900
I think that's true for a lot of other

929
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:10,750
things to them yeah yeah yeah and they

930
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:13,090
that's why they there it's a it's a new

931
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,950
field mm-hmm the whole entertainment and

932
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,859
like social media like influence or

933
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:19,780
whatever and people just like wow I see

934
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:21,340
this person so much sure life must be so

935
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,139
good because you don't know everything

936
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,940
that's going on you just instantly are

937
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,919
just like they must be like making

938
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,050
YouTube money partying all the time

939
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:32,320
having so much fun doing all this stuff

940
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,800
I want that mm-hmm you know and they

941
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,500
they don't

942
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,210
again it's they don't understand or give

943
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,060
you guys the benefit of the doubt like

944
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,490
as human beings right how difficult it

945
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,159
can be I think it's a maturity thing to

946
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:47,020
a lot of these kids are like you know

947
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,190
they're kids they don't know the full

948
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,440
scope of being an adult

949
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,730
yeah I'm an adult yeah there's yeah

950
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,830
there are people who are like you know

951
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,720
even our age I want to do YouTube and

952
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,940
like you know they do think it is easier

953
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,220
but most people no say most people think

954
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,790
what we do is a lot easier than it

955
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,880
really is

956
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,780
and they I think the reason why I mean

957
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,330
you can see it in the comments and

958
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:10,390
someone like like Lily right she said oh

959
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:12,460
I'm taking a break or whatever instantly

960
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,440
people were like oh you know why are you

961
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,210
so another youtuber this depressed you

962
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,740
know I has meant to issues like they

963
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,210
were making jokes out of it yeah saying

964
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,500
like oh you know these guys are so

965
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,640
unappreciative they made so much money

966
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,390
and they're getting all this fame like

967
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,560
oh life must be rough you know but like

968
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,210
this brought me to the bite I thought

969
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,640
about this a lot I don't even know if

970
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,819
I've made a

971
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,059
brought it up but another perspective

972
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:38,420
and might sound bad but it's your

973
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:39,440
podcast yes my haven't done one of those

974
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,750
in a while

975
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,089
it's my podcast I can do what I want I

976
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:47,319
something I thought about a lot and I

977
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:52,670
think you really don't realize it until

978
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:54,650
you have it when I say that just because

979
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,240
you have those things happiness doesn't

980
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,769
come from those things and it's on so

981
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,630
common that cabinets doesn't come from

982
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:01,760
money doesn't come from fame and you

983
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,920
don't really really believe it until you

984
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,450
have it yeah because I didn't I used to

985
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,160
think okay yeah I just want a family and

986
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,599
whatever but in the back your head

987
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,579
you're like man if I had this much money

988
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:12,470
I wouldn't be sad yeah he's fine like if

989
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:14,750
I had this much fame like who cares if

990
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,960
you know something happens I'm famous

991
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:19,640
and rich you know like and you know you

992
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,680
you really don't understand that it

993
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,880
really means nothing um the best way I

994
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,230
can describe it is like someone like

995
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,359
Robin Williams someone who everyone

996
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:28,579
loved right everybody loved he had it

997
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:29,900
all he had money he had fame it's not

998
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:31,849
his career was getting worse everybody

999
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,970
he was a legend but he still you know

1000
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:36,200
killed himself yeah and that just goes

1001
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,299
to show you it has nothing to do with

1002
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,039
that sure yes it does help to have money

1003
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:41,450
right to do things I don't believe in

1004
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:43,579
the saying that money doesn't buy any

1005
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,410
happiness yeah but until you have it you

1006
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:48,279
realize it doesn't mean as much as it

1007
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:50,630
nearly you would think at least yeah

1008
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:52,849
it's just coming from that perspective I

1009
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,650
agree I mean I think that's like another

1010
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:56,599
big reason why I kind of left the scene

1011
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:59,359
right because it's for like you know

1012
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,200
sanity mm-hmm if not like some people

1013
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,420
can handle it

1014
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,609
yeah people like me can't but it's also

1015
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,380
you know I always say to it's always

1016
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:08,240
like the grass is greener yeah I know

1017
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:12,470
for a fact I wouldn't be happy doing a

1018
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,450
nine-to-five clerk job it creatively at

1019
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,250
least and so in that way I understand

1020
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:20,390
I'm still appreciative of you know what

1021
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:22,099
we have but at the same time sometimes I

1022
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,900
do wish I'm like man if I just work 9:00

1023
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:27,109
to 5:00 and just focused on that time

1024
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,670
and not worry I wouldn't I could have my

1025
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:30,440
nights and not worry about work

1026
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:33,440
I could have weekend's you know which I

1027
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,299
don't have because I have to make my own

1028
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,880
schedule when you're youtuber you are

1029
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:39,349
your own boss basically so it's a little

1030
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,579
tough mentally I don't know if all

1031
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:42,260
people are like this but I have issues

1032
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:44,330
like taking breaks or taking day

1033
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,470
or taking a vacation because I don't

1034
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,170
even have fun doing it I'm thinking

1035
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,520
about other things and that it's a

1036
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,840
blessing and a curse cuz you make your

1037
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,700
own schedule so you can take those

1038
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,590
things but like like I said it's a

1039
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,080
mental I think in your situation it's a

1040
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:58,610
curse a lot of the time could be we as a

1041
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,950
group have seen like you know when

1042
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,360
you're just like like it's clear that

1043
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,040
you're definitely thinking about work

1044
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,140
and and when we're like doing other

1045
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,380
things yeah unable to like just be in

1046
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,750
the moment yeah yeah it is like it is I

1047
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,010
mean even people know people know does

1048
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,290
that about me but I am just always

1049
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,940
trying to it's hard to just have fun

1050
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,830
when you know that you could be working

1051
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,060
if it was like a nine-to-five you know

1052
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,610
okay five o'clock I can do whatever I

1053
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,990
want until 9:00 the next day it's just a

1054
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:26,690
mindset I know it's like a first-world

1055
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:29,120
foot it is it does mess with people I

1056
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,380
think a lot of people um any messes with

1057
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,090
me a lot this is what I heard though

1058
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,520
like when people say oh it's a first

1059
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:36,230
world problem but it's also like you're

1060
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,000
listening to a podcast like you live in

1061
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,070
the first world most likely true sure

1062
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,390
yeah that is true but I mean what that's

1063
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:44,840
just I'm saying it in the meme sense

1064
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:47,150
it's not even like it's something you I

1065
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,830
if I really could mentally get over that

1066
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,900
then it wouldn't be a big deal huh but

1067
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:53,030
it's just it just happens I think a lot

1068
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,950
of like even like personal businesses

1069
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,300
anybody who owns a business really can

1070
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:58,490
yeah really relate to that

1071
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,960
it's all about balance yeah I mean

1072
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,400
that's like one of the biggest issues in

1073
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,650
life is like work-life balance you know

1074
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,800
yeah it's one of the heart I feel like

1075
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:08,360
that's like one of the most common like

1076
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,690
problems in life especially like as you

1077
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,700
get older and becoming an adult you know

1078
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,680
like having that work-life balance like

1079
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,090
really means a lot I mean that's what

1080
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,560
you're even that's the whole point of

1081
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,690
why you moved and stuff like that yeah

1082
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,180
yeah and it's important for people think

1083
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,130
about think about it cuz we're old now

1084
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,660
you know yeah before we could just like

1085
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,580
think about let's just make a video I

1086
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,440
don't know let's go to Utah or let's do

1087
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,790
whatever we want but now it's like no

1088
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,830
but if we go there we're gonna be tired

1089
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:35,900
when we come back this is a different

1090
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,820
mindset I think and before we could do

1091
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,890
like 24 hours a day working and yeah are

1092
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,570
perfectly fine and we're cool we're cool

1093
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,890
with like sleeping a few hours so that

1094
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,960
we could play video games when we want

1095
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:47,450
and yeah that's basically that that

1096
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,310
changed I can't do that anymore

1097
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:51,050
yeah I'm not living that college life

1098
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,410
anymore I know we're definitely getting

1099
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,109
older yeah

1100
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,910
to segue even though we're getting older

1101
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:58,740
I believe that we're all still part of

1102
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,900
the nine year old army which is

1103
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,609
basically PewDiePie's audience kind of

1104
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,009
like we support is that a nine year

1105
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:06,599
that's is that's like that's what the

1106
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:09,869
whole joke is like he's had several

1107
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,039
different regimes of audiences and right

1108
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:13,529
now I think it's like the nine year old

1109
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,690
army and you were talking about memes

1110
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:18,180
earlier and we do the collapse isn't you

1111
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:21,180
there's a huge just go subscribe to

1112
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:25,440
PewDiePie kind of thing yeah but he is

1113
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:28,289
doing a meme review with Elon Musk that

1114
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,119
is crazy that is insane but at the same

1115
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:32,309
time it makes so much sense right yeah

1116
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,630
for Elon Musk cuz he had he knows that's

1117
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:36,269
like one of the big it's like going on

1118
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:38,819
an eighth like a late-night show yeah

1119
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:40,440
but bigger uh-huh because his show is so

1120
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:42,089
big and with the whole him battling T

1121
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,190
series things is it's just like building

1122
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:46,400
even more yeah it makes more sense to go

1123
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:49,769
on that show than it would be to go on a

1124
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,210
like a good morning show exactly yeah so

1125
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:54,950
it kind of does make sense but it is

1126
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:57,960
crazy how this this Janet this uh this

1127
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,579
this wave I guess is Qi held mainstream

1128
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,200
it's becoming the new mainstream media

1129
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:02,490
it's finally branching on ya and that's

1130
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,200
something also that I wanted to bring up

1131
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:09,029
was the impact that social media has

1132
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:13,859
because there are like traditional

1133
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:16,890
mainstream mainstream media stars who

1134
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:18,420
are very aware of the social media stars

1135
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:20,430
and I feel like when the social media

1136
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,200
stars meet them and they find out like

1137
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:25,319
oh the traditional person knows about me

1138
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,059
they're shocked right oh and it's like

1139
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:29,369
but you you have almost like a bigger

1140
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:33,240
reach than they do a lot of the time and

1141
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:34,680
it's just like going to show um like I

1142
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,119
think I think is something like Shane

1143
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:41,700
Dawson's the minded Jake Paul yeah like

1144
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,180
his viewership was beating a bunch of

1145
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:47,250
Netflix original shows in terms of

1146
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:50,130
viewership well for one I mean it's free

1147
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:52,529
right yeah so not everyone has Netflix I

1148
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,240
think that's a big part of it too but

1149
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:55,500
like a lot of television is free the

1150
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,839
difference is is that when Shane puts it

1151
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,849
out you can notified for one and also

1152
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,049
you don't have to you can watch it when

1153
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:03,119
you want to watch it you don't have to

1154
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:04,799
wait til it comes on at 9:00 p.m. or

1155
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,280
8:00 p.m. you just pull out your phone

1156
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:08,290
it's a new version of entertainment

1157
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,060
mmm-hmm it's happening dude we've been

1158
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,500
saying for a long time the internet was

1159
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,590
gonna take over TV and it was always

1160
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:16,660
kind of there and that was a joke that

1161
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:18,430
killed the television but it really is

1162
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,890
now mmm you know people like Elon Musk

1163
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:23,250
are going on PewDiePie show you know you

1164
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:28,590
know it's it's really changed a lot yeah

1165
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:32,470
all right just subscribe be to t-series

1166
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:35,670

1167
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:35,670
the way that sounds we're mine

1168
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:44,419
a we cut that part out right now we're

1169
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:46,309
leaving that ya know what you alright

1170
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:48,589
what else just how you did you watch the

1171
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:50,779
Super Bowl you don't like football I did

1172
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:52,579
you wash it though not all those you go

1173
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:52,999
all the way through but I watched ya at

1174
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:55,699
home

1175
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:59,269
it was own kind of you would have more

1176
00:42:55,699 --> 00:43:02,359
fun watching paint dry that's not true

1177
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:04,459
it was it was slow though yeah I watched

1178
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:05,569
you the first half and I was like I kind

1179
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:07,189
of have an idea where this is gonna go

1180
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:08,719
I'm gonna check back in at 4th quarter

1181
00:43:07,189 --> 00:43:11,299
yeah I think it's part of it too it's

1182
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:14,479
just like oh it's Tom Brady again yeah

1183
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:17,869
what else is new I mean I like the Tom

1184
00:43:14,479 --> 00:43:19,669
Brady and uh Gronk Instagram videos more

1185
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:21,799
than the actual game that's true that's

1186
00:43:19,669 --> 00:43:23,599
it's so funny see you know what I don't

1187
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:26,749
understand I mean I watch football but

1188
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,899
like I'm not super like serious like I'm

1189
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:32,659
you know 49ers fan so we're irrelevant

1190
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:34,369
but I always thought like I don't

1191
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:35,839
understand why people hate Tom Brady so

1192
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:38,059
much I mean I get the whole like

1193
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,369
deflating ball things which from what I

1194
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:41,929
hear at least they labeled him a cheater

1195
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:43,789
but even if it even if that's the case

1196
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:45,589
him as a person he seems like a really

1197
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:50,839
cool dude doesn't he yeah yeah very

1198
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:53,119
family man disease sons yeah people will

1199
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,739
still make fun of that seems like like a

1200
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,269
nice dude he seemed that the guy you

1201
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:58,249
invite to a party and he'd be like hey

1202
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:59,959
can I help you guys clean up yeah that's

1203
00:43:58,249 --> 00:44:02,359
the kind of guy like what should I bring

1204
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:04,159
yeah mmm whereas some people some of the

1205
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:05,059
football players they look like I want

1206
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,739
to make it all about me

1207
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,389
mm-hmm they come into the party they

1208
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:11,419
start dancing and get a whole circle

1209
00:44:08,389 --> 00:44:13,399
around them extroverts I don't know how

1210
00:44:11,419 --> 00:44:14,929
but it's so it's so easy to hate on

1211
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:17,419
somebody who's like that that's why and

1212
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:20,269
successful yeah like everyone wants the

1213
00:44:17,419 --> 00:44:22,309
underdog to do better yeah and it's you

1214
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:25,399
know but he was an underdog though yeah

1215
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:26,989
well like team sports fandoms yeah yeah

1216
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:28,609
they're hard they're hardcore so it's

1217
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:30,409
true you know you're always gonna root

1218
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:33,799
for your team I'm just saying there's so

1219
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:36,380
many like other people out there that

1220
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:38,179
play sports that probably deserve more

1221
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,829
hate for being like kind of a jerk but

1222
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:41,029
like when you're a humble person I mean

1223
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:42,469
I think he's no I don't know well I

1224
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:43,939
don't know him personally but he seems

1225
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:46,699
like a nice dude like it just a clean

1226
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:47,929
cool dude hey Tom Brady we don't know

1227
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:50,329
you but you should come on this podcast

1228
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:51,590
if we can figure out if you are not yeah

1229
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:54,410
because he's definitely walk

1230
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:55,940
oh yes ace social media influence you

1231
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:57,920
know maybe his sons will find out about

1232
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,450
it after he kisses his dad by the way

1233
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,820
Ryan Higa wants you to be on his podcast

00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:07,370
Wow okay well I mean I knew you weren't

00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,990

1239
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:14,810

do you like the commercials though yeah

1241
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:19,010
some of them I was a little disappointed

1242
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:21,290
this year was yeah I didn't see too many

1243
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:23,090
this year there was a one with the

1244
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,950
Backstreet Boys that was kind of funny

1245
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:26,570
Oh a chance yeah a chance to rap yeah

1246
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:28,340
yeah yeah other than that I was just

1247
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:33,620
like oh okay

1248
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:35,150
it's oh man it used to be very like yeah

1249
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,680
every single one was like awesome and

1250
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,750
now it's just like oh that was cool I

1251
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,120
guess different I wonder if it's like

1252
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:44,120
the expectation because it's discrete

1253
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,890
exactly Oh last year's was good now they

1254
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,060
have to top it yeah that's what I was

1255
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:49,430
thinking too house like maybe we're have

1256
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:52,190
to high expectations yes it's hard to

1257
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:54,770
beat and there's been a lot so you know

1258
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,080
how many new original commercials can

1259
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:58,370
you come up with yeah for sure yeah you

1260
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,470
know what too though it's kind of like

1261
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:02,030
what we described YouTube videos as like

1262
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,680
if you're always topping you topping

1263
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:04,880
your previous video a certain point

1264
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,560
you're gonna plateau or people are gonna

1265
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,480
get so accustomed to that so you do have

1266
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,070
to throw some like fillers out there's

1267
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,870
some like you know you don't have to

1268
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:14,660
always be topping yourself but come back

1269
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:16,580

1270
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:20,060

hey that was a fast break they don't

1321
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,520
know that at least for them they thought

1322
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:12,079
unless if we had an ad there where it's

1323
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,810
supposed to be but we don't have that I

1324
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,240
pooped you did yep yeah we're actually

1325
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:19,030
you were just it sounds so immature we

1326
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:23,030
were just talking about poopy

1327
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:25,730
no but we were saying how so Shaun and I

1328
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,960
used to wrestle and you know we had to

1329
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:28,760
lose weight weight to cut weight all the

1330
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,220
time pooping helps realistically it's

1331
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,930
not not an immature thing is we had to

1332
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,339
learn techniques to poop you dropped

1333
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:36,349
weight when you poop yeah there's

1334
00:48:34,339 --> 00:48:39,140
certain ways that you and we found the

1335
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:42,050
strats the strats to help us poop like

1336
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:45,020
one is like rubbing your your your

1337
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:46,520
stomach was it clockwise helps a lot to

1338
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,810
help things get moo-ving we could be

1339
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,640
just making this up by the way but it

1340
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:51,410
for us it works yeah but the one that

1341
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,950
nobody really can relate to that we used

1342
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:54,890
to do it

1343
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:57,109
we call it the bouncies and basically

1344
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:59,089
you just kind of get up and you have to

1345
00:48:57,109 --> 00:49:00,710
like completely relax your stomach relax

1346
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:01,849
everything and just start like slowly

1347
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,800
like bending your knee like just

1348
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:06,319
bouncing and laying your stomach or how

1349
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,900
do you describe it just let it drop dude

1350
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,910
yeah and it works it makes you have to

1351
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,170
poop yeah you know I don't know if

1352
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,760
people can relate to this I don't know

1353
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:18,079
if you're at home just try it give it a

1354
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,339
shot no audience yeah I know no girls

1355
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,160
can do it to they don't have to admit it

1356
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:24,829
but girls girls girls don't poop are you

1357
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,079
sure yes heard that they might they

1358
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:28,760
don't poop oh well the guys you guys

1359
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:30,770
can't ride the girls eat you don't know

1360
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,300
the sensation didn't have butthole you

1361
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:34,160
know what we're talking about though no

1362
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,540
bouncing up and down to height like it

1363
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,869
makes sense like if you think of like a

1364
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:40,819
ketchup bottle but let's shake your body

1365
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:42,410
so it's you shake your body but you have

1366
00:49:40,819 --> 00:49:44,119
to be super relaxed like you kind of

1367
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:46,400
like after you bend your knees and like

1368
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:49,490
yeah just bounce up and down real like

1369
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,079
lightly but like why are we all doing it

1370
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,910
it's like we're trying to try it right

1371
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:54,440
now describe it to people without having

1372
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:56,030
to show it if four people who are just

1373
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:00,200
listen nobody's here describing it

1374
00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:01,819
you're like doing it because you can't

1375
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,970
do it if you're tense right yeah you

1376
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:06,560
need to realize I bet you people

1377
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,480
listening when you're describing two

1378
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,770
motions they're doing it too if you

1379
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,319
caught yourself doing yeah leave a

1380
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:19,430
comment like driving their car to work

1381
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:21,530
yeah they're stuck in traffic and they

1382
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:23,150
got a poop and that's your fault and

1383
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,980
your fault well it's actually hard to do

1384
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,390
without when you're sitting it's way

1385
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,220
easier to be standing I don't know man I

1386
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:32,329
just had an experience getting off the

1387
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:37,010
plane today yeah today you your

1388
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:39,710
pants huh almost okay so what happened

1389
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:41,569
was midway through the flight like you

1390
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,760
know how when the ride gets bumpy you

1391
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:44,990
like turn on the seatbelt light yep and

1392
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,599
you can they're like you have to stay

1393
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:50,510
seated right yeah I had to poop right

1394
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,730
when that happened and because of the

1395
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:54,710
turbulence was giving me the bouncies oh

1396
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:56,569
my god intentional bouncies and I was

1397
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:59,060
trying to clench - okay so that's when

1398
00:50:56,569 --> 00:51:00,859
you that's when you have to poop yeah it

1399
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:03,470
works I'm just saying we don't have

1400
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:06,859
that's the strategy we used to use dude

1401
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:08,329
is like TMI but third time I pooped

1402
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:10,910

I was on this keto diet its reduced to

1407
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:22,010
about two two times a day that's not

1408
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:24,740

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,560

00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,720
that there's no way all right what how

1471
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:51,720
did how did it go down then well for one

1472
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,560
we have a interesting reading pass -

1473
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:56,460
yeah

1474
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:59,010
share it with the class well I mean just

1475
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:01,050
to start I mean I think our our

1476
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:03,450
relationship is kind of like we could be

1477
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:05,040
not friends for a long time or like not

1478
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,990
not friends but we could not hang out

1479
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,300
for like years or talk or anything and

1480
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:10,500
then once you see him when you're free -

1481
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,200
we'll hang out you know like just like

1482
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,550
nothing ever happened and I feel like

1483
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,530
some friendships work that way

1484
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:17,700
I don't know and some you just if you're

1485
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:19,320
if you're not talking to them like

1486
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,390
consistently they just forget about you

1487
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,160
and you just never see them ever again I

1488
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,630
think it's because like everyone kind of

1489
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,190
has like a preference of what a

1490
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,600
friendship should be like or if you know

1491
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:29,250
it's kind of like the love language

1492
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,990
thing like you receive love and like

1493
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:33,840
affection in different ways than other

1494
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:36,420
people I think for you and me it's we've

1495
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,560
always had that friendship despite not

1496
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,550
talking to each other and we're

1497
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,770
perfectly fine with that

1498
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:42,810
yeah and we still hold like a very deep

1499
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:44,160
friendship mm-hmm despite everything we

1500
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:46,410
don't need to talk to each other every

1501
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,810
single week or like even every year yeah

1502
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,830
but we didn't talk for a long time even

1503
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:52,140
even when you when you were in college

1504
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:54,060
and then you know it's like oh if you're

1505
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:56,700
back home then we'll go hang out yeah it

1506
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:58,410
was like nothing change and yeah yeah I

1507
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,540
don't know what the secret to that is I

1508
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:02,610
think it's just being both parties need

1509
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,780
to know like it's nothing personal you

1510
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,640
know if we don't reach out you don't

1511
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,960
have to reach out to somebody and check

1512
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,750
it check in on them like every single

1513
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,030
like month just to maintain a friendship

1514
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:15,750
yeah I think some people need to do that

1515
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:17,340
but I don't think we need I mean we

1516
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,420
don't need yeah because we understand

1517
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,920
like okay you're doing everything I'm

1518
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,720
doing mind if you happen to be the same

1519
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,010
town we're gonna hang out yeah and you

1520
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,380
know with like social media and stuff

1521
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:27,660
like you can look from afar and still

1522
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,100
like give someone love yeah and still

1523
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,510
respect them and still be friends with

1524
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,770
them without having to call them up

1525
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,450
every single day I was just talking to

1526
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:34,740
Paco about this I was like yeah dude

1527
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,330
like I know I don't reach out to you all

1528
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,190
the time but just know that I'm always

1529
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:40,080
watching from afar and I carry dude yeah

1530
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:42,780
I see his Instagram likes and you know

1531
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,310
watch my storm like my boy Shawn yeah

1532
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,410
see but like that's some people actually

1533
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:49,230
get offended yeah that stuff I know so I

1534
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:50,760
think if you learn if both parties are

1535
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,830
cool I think that's I guess the secret

1536
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,870
if both people are have a mutual

1537
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:55,490
understanding like

1538
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:57,140
you don't need to check up every single

1539
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:58,610
week yeah it's actually if you're not

1540
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,200
like hanging out you know it's like

1541
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:02,660
relationships you got to have that

1542
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,790
mutual understanding you need to know

1543
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:07,340
how each other clicks and what like each

1544
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:08,600
other likes and dislikes yeah everyone

1545
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,430
is different I don't think there's a

1546
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:13,250
real secret to behind it it just kind of

1547
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:22,910
worked out with us yeah all right you

1548
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:26,750
nerds the reason so Shane won Greg asked

1549
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:29,330
um what's your favorite anime why are

1550
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:31,910
you doing like a X is that well because

1551
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:33,080
it's a favorite meme anime I don't care

1552
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:34,400
okay I just want to know what your

1553
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:37,040
favorite anime what's yours Shawn

1554
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,920
favorite anime it's got a mean art oh

1555
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:42,080
yeah I would say of all time even though

1556
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,420
I don't know why no to get so much hate

1557
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,670
oh sorry Naruto you say it wrong they

1558
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,200
make fun of you too yeah dude but anyway

1559
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:52,670
yeah I would say that was probably like

1560
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:54,380
my favorite all over time yeah we're

1561
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:56,480
just talking about this too about how

1562
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:58,670
animes like I feel like kids should

1563
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,200
watch them to grow up not to grow up wow

1564
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,880
they're growing up like we did I think

1565
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,260
it's not all animes especially the ones

1566
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:08,780
like the ones that people hate on like

1567
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:10,460
DBZ or Naruto or my hero like it's all

1568
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,510
all the protagonists the people that you

1569
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,000
fall in love with the one that you're

1570
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:15,200
following have really good morals like

1571
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,850
they're just good people

1572
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,550
yeah I think also they have big flaws

1573
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:21,230
that are very very yeah and it shows

1574
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:22,760
like oh you can overcome this time

1575
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,320
exactly and that's what we're saying

1576
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,450
like for Naruto he's like this loser

1577
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,740
he's a kid who gets bullied no one in

1578
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:30,320
the town likes him that's what it starts

1579
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,820
off and it really teaches you like man

1580
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,050
you got to work hard like the reason why

1581
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,090
you respect him is like man it's so

1582
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,770
touching cuz he just keeps pushing he

1583
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:39,950
pushes through you know and any has such

1584
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:41,450
this dark past and I think it's just it

1585
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:45,620
would be good for kids yeah he makes the

1586
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:47,590
most of it and he ends up becoming like

1587
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,890
a cool guy yeah I don't know spoilers

1588
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:52,940
yeah

1589
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:55,910
those been done alright yeah but hi I

1590
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,920
like I like Naruto they reflect a lot of

1591
00:57:55,910 --> 00:58:00,410
like real-life situations while you

1592
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,720
canyon i don't really watch anime you

1593
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:04,370
watch online I know I really want peace

1594
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,920
you guys'll I did watch a lot I like

1595
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,400
read a lot of it and then you read manga

1596
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,150
you

1597
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:13,550
but it comes in like burst III only

1598
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:16,670
do it when I was like oh man this sounds

1599
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:18,790
so lame huh but I would uh the first

1600
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:20,960
types of like manga and stuff or

1601
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:25,460
Japanese cartoons or whatever that I

1602
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:28,100
would read was a lot of uh like harems

1603
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,650
sad which is basically it's like one guy

1604
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:31,940
a lot of girls and they're all trying to

1605
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:34,700
fight for his love they caught something

1606
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:37,580
else like not porn

hentai

1609
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:41,810

1610
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:45,190
hmm

1611
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:48,080
no but the reason why the reason why I

1612
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:50,720
liked those is because I was like man I

1613
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:53,840

00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,610

01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,880
made some quotes in and I know Sean

1645
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,890
actually watches them because he has

1646
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,300
references in them that we did not

1647
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,930
expect him to know yeah trying to grab

1648
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:22,720

but you are quoting the podcast showing

1656
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,650

1661
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,540

there's a lot yeah there's a bunch

1663
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:59,290
I thought we only had one page but then

1664
01:00:55,470 --> 01:01:01,870
this is do one more and then yeah it's

1665
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:04,030
more fun to just talk I want to see this

1666
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:07,690

1669
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,000
about Paco and rhpc not give okay so

1670
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:18,160
joke somebody actually wrote that but

1671
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,810
here so this is one doesn't one um

1672
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:24,730
who's someone that you miss the most why

1673
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:26,740
and then the second question is why do

1674
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:28,570
you miss me the least cuz that's the

1675
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:30,280
obvious answer you know no not

1676
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:42,730
necessarily you don't think I'll miss

1677
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:44,920
you the least you should tell the people

1678
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:47,140
what you said to Dana I think you went

1679
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,300
to Papua jokes a lot clearly you know

1680
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:51,010

1682
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:54,850

1683
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:58,120

Dana dude oh man

1688
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:07,240
Dana is someone who gets I think the

1689
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:09,760
least amount of love who probably

1690
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:12,670

1715
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,220
the first time that you're gonna lean on

yeah the first time she visited babies

1717
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,880
she was already helping yep yep she was

1718
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:10,349
already helping you could tell when she

1719
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,510
came into the company that there was a

1720
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:13,980
shift in all of like a production value

1721
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:14,490
I think Shawn what did you say when she

1722
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,260
came in

1723
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,670
you're just like because you were doing

1724
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:20,130
a lot of the problems before yeah a lot

1725
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:21,810
of it was me and like Derek and Greg

1726
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:24,810
just running around trying to make do

1727
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:26,580
and I think like we used to buy a lot of

1728
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,090
stuff yeah and like you know like I

1729
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:29,130
remember

1730
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:31,740
Aquaman was like a big boy yeah it looks

1731
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:33,359
so I tried my best to like find all the

1732
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:36,420
stuff that kind of relatively looked

1733
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:39,930
like it but once Dana was brought in

1734
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:41,490
dude look though I mean you guys did a

1735
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:43,530
great it was part of the joke you know

1736
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:45,660
to have it look kind of wack yeah but I

1737
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:47,490
was tough though Dana was good Dana's

1738
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:50,339
good all right set design like

1739
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:52,260

01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,700
she graduated an interior design yeah

1742
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:58,109
considering how much time turnaround

1743
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,880
time if there was a lot more time they'd

1744
01:03:58,109 --> 01:04:02,369
be even better yeah but she doesn't in

1745
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,960

asking her for help and then she's she's

1773
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:32,099
like why would I help you you called me

1774
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:37,259
up for and I was like that's a

1775
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:40,519
compliment you're 3 at best but it

1776
01:05:37,259 --> 01:05:43,410
wasn't she wasn't laughing the same way

1777
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:46,410
and it was like oh wait she took that

1778
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:48,299
kind of serious it was a little I walked

1779
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:51,059
I walked in on that part and I was like

1780
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:53,489
that's a little cringy dude it gets

1781
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:55,619
worse but not because of me because of

1782
01:05:53,489 --> 01:05:58,019
someone else but we won't say it's it's

1783
01:05:55,619 --> 01:06:00,209
it's you understand like this is a very

1784
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:02,039
friendly place where we can we rag on

1785
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:04,890
each other a lot yeah I I get it the

1786
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:05,969
most so I'm able whoa yeah yeah we do we

1787
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:09,059
do give it to you a lot but yeah only

1788
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:10,920
because you I mean you set yourself up

1789
01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:12,719
for that I'm okay with that

1790
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,999
I know it's part your comedy I know my

1791
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:17,219
role yeah it is fun yeah it's fun for

1792
01:06:14,999 --> 01:06:18,839
all of us but I think now everybody that

1793
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:21,059
group kind of has that guy though yeah

1794
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:22,229
yeah usually the loved one like in TV

1795
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:23,249
shows and something I hope gets fragged

1796
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:25,199
on usually that's the character that

1797
01:06:23,249 --> 01:06:26,339
people love mm-hmm but not at first

1798
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:27,209
everyone's like oh it's so easy to hate

1799
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:29,459
him and then after a while you're like

1800
01:06:27,209 --> 01:06:33,239
oh yeah guilty for hating on this person

1801
01:06:29,459 --> 01:06:35,549
yeah yeah but I'm like now I think I

1802
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,949

1803
01:06:35,549 --> 01:06:38,849

and we basically lived it but yeah

1825
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:30,350
that's I kind of missed it that was like

1826
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:32,180
right when I left yeah it was actually

1827
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:34,310
right when you left yeah it's like six

1828
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:35,150
months ago because yeah I just met her

1829
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:37,850
and then I left

1830
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:40,670
oh yeah her like the first uh-huh two

1831
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:42,680
times like maybe and then yeah yeah and

1832
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:44,600
then that video came out yeah

1833
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,950
long story short cuz it kind of there's

1834
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:48,170
no context really for people who don't

1835
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:52,790
know I was recently in my first

1836
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:55,940
relationship ever as a 27 year old and

1837
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:58,340
then basically she wasn't the person

1838
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:00,080
that I found out to be found out that

1839
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,340
she had cheated on me don't say names

1840
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,560
yeah I'm not of course I'm not gonna say

1841
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:08,300
names oh you never know I don't want

1842
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:10,070
dumbass no no no no but yes so then we I

1843
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,890
broke it off with her and like it hurt

1844
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:14,600
me a lot but it also taught me a lot and

1845
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:19,310
I just made a video about it I was very

1846
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:20,660
introspective um and like Sean Sean said

1847
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,490
earlier he's not someone who like goes

1848
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:24,590
into it but he shows support from afar

1849
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:26,030
and like when I picked him up today from

1850
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:27,620
the airport it wasn't something that I

1851
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:29,270
expected I don't ever expect any of my

1852
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:31,130
friends to watch any of my videos but uh

1853
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:33,410
he was like Washington yeah I didn't

1854
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:35,480
expect that is good too that's a

1855
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:37,850
surprise to me why it okay so when

1856
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:41,030
you're being serious and not being your

1857
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:42,740
normal self we're never serious dude

1858
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:44,450
then it's like okay this is concerning

1859
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:46,370
so of course we're gonna be there good

1860
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:48,110
you know but like if you're happy and

1861
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:50,630
being you of course we're gonna pick on

1862
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:54,080
you like it's just a dynamic but

1863
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:57,260
basically like it it showed me a lot

1864
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,570
like help me grow as a person because I

1865
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:01,460
was someone who was like oh love is such

1866
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:03,410
a beautiful thing like you know it's

1867
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,000
this fantasy and you should do

1868
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:07,160
everything for it but that's not true

1869
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,870
most first relationships are kind of

1870
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:11,239
yeah that's what you expect yeah yeah

1871
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:14,569
and and you you kind of learn at

1872
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:16,069
while like oh you know not you're not

1873
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:18,319
meant for everybody and everybody isn't

1874
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:19,819
meant for you you shouldn't be you

1875
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,739
should know what you deserve

1876
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:23,779
mmm type of thing and you can you kind

1877
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:26,389
of develop self-respect at that point

1878
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:29,299
ya know what it is and you have to what

1879
01:09:26,389 --> 01:09:30,710
I had a hard time realizing over over

1880
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:35,329
time with different relationships Oh

1881
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:36,799
tell them not not every single there's

1882
01:09:35,329 --> 01:09:38,869
no I mean I don't believe that there is

1883
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:40,519
a absolute perfect person for you

1884
01:09:38,869 --> 01:09:42,289
because even if you find your it you

1885
01:09:40,519 --> 01:09:44,150
know your soulmate or whatever if you

1886
01:09:42,289 --> 01:09:45,409
whoever you think that is the perfect

1887
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:46,670
person they'd like all the things you

1888
01:09:45,409 --> 01:09:48,679
like whatever it is someone that matches

1889
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:49,940
perfectly with you you're still gonna

1890
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:52,309
have to work on it together because

1891
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:54,800
there's no perfect relationship yeah

1892
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:56,749
yeah of course but you know it growing

1893
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,639
up you always think oh I gonna I'm gonna

1894
01:09:56,749 --> 01:10:01,639
wait for that one yeah or you know

1895
01:09:58,639 --> 01:10:03,769
Garvey's installation man movies man I

1896
01:10:01,639 --> 01:10:05,570
told you movies like ruin relationships

1897
01:10:03,769 --> 01:10:07,550
for in the beginning yeah and then you

1898
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:09,499
learn okay this let's be realistic yeah

1899
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:11,329
a good quote I heard was everyone's

1900
01:10:09,499 --> 01:10:13,849
looking for the right one but nobody

1901
01:10:11,329 --> 01:10:15,440
wants to be the right one who said that

1902
01:10:13,849 --> 01:10:19,400
I don't know I just saw it that's like

1903
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:21,590
something I don't know I don't know just

1904
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:28,699
like that one dude who I was like makes

1905
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:32,179
those videos Matthew Hussey yeah he

1906
01:10:28,699 --> 01:10:33,920
takes things and oh yes he has things

1907
01:10:32,179 --> 01:10:40,190
that are like so deep and meaningful but

1908
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:42,530
I got like whoa you bow I bet you we

1909
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:44,480
could make one right now yeah you know

1910
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:46,999
in life you got to be a piece of paper

1911
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,619
ooh you're open to so many different

1912
01:10:46,999 --> 01:10:50,329
things it's not about what the paper is

1913
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:53,690
it's about what you write on the paper

1914
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:55,670
and tell your story on that paper don't

1915
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:57,619

1921
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:11,780
with the earth the organic be you be

1922
01:11:09,829 --> 01:11:14,329
genuine see we're making one right now

1923
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:16,400
behavior yeah also what happens people

1924
01:11:14,329 --> 01:11:17,900
will be paper chasing so that's what you

1925
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:23,139
want to be to people would chase you

1926
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:23,139
when they find out your true value yeah

1927
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:28,780
that's enough anyways

1928
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:30,610
Shawn you are in a relationship I'm not

1929
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:32,890
saying you're a guru or anything but

1930
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:35,190
like I guess because like we said

1931
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:37,330
earlier long distances very difficult oh

1932
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:39,790
what is what are some things that are

1933
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:43,660
tit on that what are some things that uh

1934
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:45,820
you feel like really helps I guess you

1935
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:48,880
know that overcome difficulties like

1936
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:51,640
that communication communication and

1937
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,470
mutual understanding is the biggest yeah

1938
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:56,200
so most important things it's simple but

1939
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:58,120
it's difficult yeah because you know you

1940
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:00,310
need to be able to have an understanding

1941
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,470
between both parties and understand what

1942
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:03,880
you want as part of the relationship and

1943
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:06,370
there's a lot of trust that comes behind

1944
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,390
it - mm-hmm because you know because

1945
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:09,070
you're long distance you don't know what

1946
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:10,420
they're doing on there and right they

1947
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:12,940
don't know what you're doing so you have

1948
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:15,610
to build a lot of trust and a lot of

1949
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:17,140
communication and be open to it I think

1950
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:20,170
especially for guys were kind of like

1951
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:21,880
you know closed doors but that is true

1952
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:24,640
actually that's another guys I think

1953
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:27,580
majority men are typically more closed

1954
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:30,490
off as like emotionally you know so I

1955
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:32,020
think a big part especially for me I

1956
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:34,240
don't know about other people but for my

1957
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:37,870
from my experience it was being able to

1958
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:41,550
be completely open 100% to your

1959
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:43,870
significant other yeah and being able

1960
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:45,340
like even if there's problems there's

1961
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:46,960
always gonna be problems but being able

1962
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:48,970
to come to a compromise and have an

1963
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,390
understanding and build that trust

1964
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:54,730
between both parties right because

1965
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:55,240
without the trust and it's hope it's

1966
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:58,360
hopeless

1967
01:12:55,240 --> 01:13:00,100
yeah you know cousin really like if

1968
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:02,260
there's no trust then why are you with

1969
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:04,330
this person exactly but that's how

1970
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:07,180
that's how it should be with or without

1971
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:08,050
the distance yeah you know so yeah

1972
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:11,440
that's good advice

1973
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:14,650
how about you advice wise yeah I mean I

1974
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:16,990
would say in in addition to that just

1975
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:19,120
like knowing that you don't need to

1976
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:21,760
always be right it's a big deal to Oh

1977
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:23,680
tell them I mean it doesn't if you

1978
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,660
really think about it and sometimes it

1979
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,760
matters because it is what's right and

1980
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:29,530
wrong if you come to that mutual

1981
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,150
understanding it doesn't a lot of times

1982
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:34,090
I think fights happen and continue

1983
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:35,620
happening for no reason until you really

1984
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:37,090
realize why am i fighting and you

1985
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,920
realize like oh it's just because I want

1986
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:39,750
to be right and

1987
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,949
my point but that doesn't matter if you

1988
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:44,040
really care about the person you can get

1989
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:46,679
over that yeah so I think for me that's

1990
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:49,410
something I'd to learn and I think that

1991
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:51,150
causes and solves a lot of problems and

1992
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:52,440
I want to add on to that a lot of times

1993
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:54,210
when there's problems they're in a

1994
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,429
relationship people think it's oats me

1995
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:57,390
versus the other person when that's not

1996
01:13:56,429 --> 01:14:01,080
necessarily the case

1997
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:02,670
it's like both people as a team against

1998
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,500
this problem and you have to work

1999
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:06,780
together to figure out like oh how do we

2000
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:09,000
solve this issue you know how do we

2001
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:11,730
figure out how we both can win we're not

2002
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,260
I'm right you're wrong you serve me yeah

2003
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:15,120
that's everything that mentality is very

2004
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:16,170
like toxic and unhealthy for a

2005
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,790
relationship when you can figure out

2006
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:19,050
like oh even just the wording of that

2007
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:21,239
yeah yeah sorry go ahead

2008
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:22,679
you know I mean wording is huge yeah

2009
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:24,000
everybody will pick at small things like

2010
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:26,610
I can't believe you said this certain

2011
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,469
thing when it's like okay stop thinking

2012
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:32,880
so much about that both parties think

2013
01:14:28,469 --> 01:14:33,750
about okay how how can I help us get

2014
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,350
through this together

2015
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:40,110
not even I we I mean you yeah yeah but

2016
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:42,360
yeah you know you can yeah yeah but why

2017
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:44,280
you nitpicking me John why are you doing

2018
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:46,140
this well you said I when I said to be

2019
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:48,239
about us okay we just went super

2020
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,620
misogynistic cuz we made the girls sound

2021
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,360
like that well I thought you were still

2022
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:53,760
being guys do you consider that to sound

2023
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:59,610
like girls yeah alright time for peace

2024
01:14:53,760 --> 01:15:00,989

make those voices you can make those

2027
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:07,410
voices but it doesn't mean I'm being a

2028
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,610
girl I'm just being a guy yeah it was

2029
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:10,860
just a Sean Dee's coming out I'm sorry

2030
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:13,290
yeah I know so that's um don't assume

2031
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:15,870
that that was a female voice okay yeah

2032
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:17,910
don't and that was PC this of the week

2033
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:19,830
now we're going back to PC ness of the

2034
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:21,090
week I want to talk about this cuz this

2035
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:22,770
is kind of big in hallways I know what

2036
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:24,360
you're gonna talk well obviously I told

2037
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:30,150
you about it right yeah

2038
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:33,270
I just knew so a a recent thing that

2039
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:36,900
came up was a Liam Neeson was in being

2040
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:39,780
interviewed and during his interview he

2041
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:44,340
had talked about how a close friend of

2042
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:45,960
his was raped and just this is like

2043
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,860
years of years ago decades ago or

2044
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,710
something like that the interview just

2045
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,960
happened yeah yeah and he talks about

2046
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:53,250
how he asked

2047
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:57,060
his friend like oh do you know who this

2048
01:15:53,250 --> 01:16:00,210
was what race was this person and she

2049
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:01,710
said black so he essentially and I'm

2050
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:04,489
paraphrasing a bunch of stuff but

2051
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:10,670
essentially he went out and looked for

2052
01:16:04,489 --> 01:16:12,719
somebody of black color to attack and

2053
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:14,700
like he wanted to kill them for like

2054
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,190
about a week and half I think it was

2055
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:19,020
more so he was looking for someone to

2056
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:20,940
cause an altercation with him so he

2057
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:22,560
could really he could react and and and

2058
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:24,660
he said in the interview right

2059
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,160
specifically a black person yeah yeah

2060
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:27,540
and that's where all the controversy

2061
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,219
came from yeah because if you were to

2062
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:32,550
stop that story there which most

2063
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:36,780
headlines deal we'll get into that more

2064
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:39,210
but go ahead but continuing the reason

2065
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:41,400
why he was sharing this story and it's

2066
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:42,960
basically after a week to week and a

2067
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:45,390
half he realized like what am i doing

2068
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:49,350
like this is this is dumb this is

2069
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:50,670
foolish and he said he went on to say

2070
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:53,360
that he's ashamed that he thought like

2071
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:55,650
that that revenge is never the answer

2072
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:58,260
and that we should learn from this right

2073
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:59,760
but a lot of people wanted to skip that

2074
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:02,460
part yeah skip that part

2075
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,469
nitpick at certain things and just go

2076
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:07,290
out to say like Liam Neeson his races

2077
01:17:04,469 --> 01:17:08,790
yeah because back in the day he wanted

2078
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:11,370
one black guy did something to his

2079
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:14,070
friend and allegedly to allegedly yeah

2080
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:17,130
yeah and he was so angry that he wanted

2081
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:18,690
to kill a random black guy yeah even

2082
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:20,219
though that's not the full that's what

2083
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:22,230
the headline would read yeah right and

2084
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:23,910
then I could see because even when I

2085
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:26,130
first heard that from you that story I

2086
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:28,320
was just like good he's erased it like

2087
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:30,390
that that sounds it's the easiest thing

2088
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,969
to jump to yeah and then you hear the

2089
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:34,650
rest of any like oh that's the context

2090
01:17:32,969 --> 01:17:36,570
yeah and it's like okay even if he

2091
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:38,010
wasn't right he realized his wrong it's

2092
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:41,070
a long time ago for one not that that

2093
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:42,810
changes anything but most people leave

2094
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:44,430
off the other end of that yeah and you

2095
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:46,980
immediately jump to it cuz even I was

2096
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:48,870
like that I was like if you just read

2097
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:50,820
the the headline and you didn't read the

2098
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:54,390
full thing or watch the video about it

2099
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:55,920
it's very I mean it's hard to back that

2100
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:57,989
up yeah he wanted to kill a black guy

2101
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,300
it's true that's what he said

2102
01:17:57,989 --> 01:18:02,550
but it didn't have it the context behind

2103
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,710
it and that's the part that I want that

2104
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:05,969
we want to talk about at least oh no

2105
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:07,079
what do you think about that

2106
01:18:05,969 --> 01:18:08,429
this is my first time hearing all of

2107
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:10,440
this cuz I didn't actually watch the

2108
01:18:08,429 --> 01:18:12,539
interview but had some deep stuff first

2109
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:14,010
of all props to him for even coming out

2110
01:18:12,539 --> 01:18:16,079
with that that's like a tough thing to

2111
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:20,519
do at this point of time right now like

2112
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:22,199
peace eNOS you know yeah yeah so you got

2113
01:18:20,519 --> 01:18:24,900
to get the men respect because he

2114
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:26,820
realizes wrong see this and just even

2115
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,260
you saying that to if that was cut out

2116
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:30,229
from somebody they'd be like Oh Shawn's

2117
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:32,820
racist too cuz he respects Liam Neeson

2118
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:34,650
for even though he's a racist and that's

2119
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:35,940
like that's just how it spreads and you

2120
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:37,409
know why couldn't win friend groups to

2121
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,369
they someone reads an article they might

2122
01:18:37,409 --> 01:18:40,469
not even read the with anything big hey

2123
01:18:38,369 --> 01:18:41,909
you hear well Liam Neeson he hates black

2124
01:18:40,469 --> 01:18:44,130
people yeah like that's kind of how

2125
01:18:41,909 --> 01:18:46,369
people talk in headlines people talking

2126
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:48,570
head it's so like social media-driven

2127
01:18:46,369 --> 01:18:50,400
because we're taught like you know

2128
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:51,360
that's what we need to grab people's

2129
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,920
attentions right away that's why

2130
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:57,119
thumbnails titles are like that and now

2131
01:18:54,920 --> 01:19:00,150
journalism is becoming like that because

2132
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:03,210
journalism it you know is like hard to

2133
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:04,559
maintain and get revenue you know so

2134
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:06,030
it's like oh how do we drive people to

2135
01:19:04,559 --> 01:19:07,860
us yeah you have to jump on it now we

2136
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:10,019
have to get people like oh what is this

2137
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:11,940
thing maybe the more fully explained in

2138
01:19:10,019 --> 01:19:14,219
the article but very rarely do people

2139
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:15,780
ever look deeper than the surface right

2140
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:17,159
because there's so much stuff happen

2141
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:20,130
that's why they could they call things

2142
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:21,960
fake fake news yeah it's not necessarily

2143
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:23,429
fake it's just they're not showing the

2144
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,920
whole story or they're shorting trying

2145
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:28,650
to push one side of it kinda and this is

2146
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,900
kind of similar similar scenario to that

2147
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:33,269
kid that kid that was wearing the mega

2148
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:35,610
hat and I against that he was like looks

2149
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:41,369
like he was standing on yeah in dude

2150
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:42,869
yeah sorry are you an American holding

2151
01:19:41,369 --> 01:19:44,280
his drum in you know whatever

2152
01:19:42,869 --> 01:19:46,139
yeah but then when and I thought the

2153
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:48,059
same thing I like Dan this kid I said

2154
01:19:46,139 --> 01:19:50,369
the same thing I feel bad now he was

2155
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:52,739
just like everyone else I get tricked I

2156
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:53,849
was like dad I this kid deserves a look

2157
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:56,340
at his fate I want to punch him in his

2158
01:19:53,849 --> 01:19:58,860
face and then I watched the full video

2159
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:00,150
and I like because I was told like this

2160
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:02,729
oh this is not the full story and I saw

2161
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:04,110
his interview after that um he's

2162
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:05,400
standing there in a group of people

2163
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:07,110
right there doing their own like school

2164
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,550
chants or whatever like that and this

2165
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:09,780
this Native American dude starts

2166
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:11,849
pounding his drum peacefully like

2167
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:14,130
nothing he's but he walks up to him and

2168
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:16,170
the kid doesn't move he doesn't go you

2169
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:17,990
know he doesn't move anywhere he stays

2170
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:20,630
there and then we see him smiling right

2171
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:22,700
and I saw the interview of this kid and

2172
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:23,930
he seems like this shy like obviously

2173
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:25,520
people are already gonna in Psych him

2174
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:28,580
because he's a trump supporter yeah

2175
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,900
or his parents or whatever but he did

2176
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:32,420
not get in this guy's face like they

2177
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:34,400
made the video look yeah and coming from

2178
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,990
his perspective he said what could I

2179
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,760
have done if I walked away I'm

2180
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:38,870
disrespecting him I think is mr.

2181
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,230
Phillips or something I don't remember

2182
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:43,490
his name is if I if I don't smile that

2183
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:45,560
looks like I'm trying to intimidate him

2184
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:47,570
if and keep in mind this is in the

2185
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:49,220
middle of he's a 16 year old kid yeah

2186
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:50,960
this guy starts beating this drum in

2187
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:52,870
your face you know that's kind of that's

2188
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,130
way more aggressive than somebody just

2189
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:56,990
walking up to you and smiling there's

2190
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:58,730
there's so much like I didn't even know

2191
01:20:56,990 --> 01:21:00,560
all that I was like oh snap another

2192
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:02,630
races kid yeah and I didn't I didn't

2193
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,550
like him yeah I just judged him and I

2194
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:05,810
was wrong yeah I don't think not that I

2195
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:08,750
doesn't matter if he's a trump supporter

2196
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:10,490
or not he did not do what people thought

2197
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:15,260
he did yeah and like the headlines wrote

2198
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:16,400
kid arrogant kid intimidates whatever

2199
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:18,650
whatever and that happened like what a

2200
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,210
week two weeks ago I don't remember it

2201
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:22,160
wasn't that long it's very recent and

2202
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:24,770
now we're on these like Liam Neeson

2203
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:27,440
exact there's so much stunning uh I

2204
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:28,820
believe like maybe within this week yeah

2205
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,140
having this week yes like this past

2206
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:34,490
weekend that the article might have went

2207
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:36,350
out um but for so much information to be

2208
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:38,120
constantly just thrown out there and

2209
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:39,980
people still have lies people still have

2210
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:42,290
to work you know have a social life

2211
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:43,580
interact with friends how are you

2212
01:21:42,290 --> 01:21:46,250
supposed to be able to digest everything

2213
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:47,750
fully and get like the facts from both

2214
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:50,930
sides before making a decision

2215
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:52,550
everyone is just so will so willingly to

2216
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:54,380
just believe what they want because they

2217
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:56,180
want to be like oh this is my side you

2218
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:57,950
know I'm either a Democrat or a

2219
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:59,480
Republican you know and this is what I'm

2220
01:21:57,950 --> 01:22:01,190
just gonna believe right and I'm just

2221
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:03,620
gonna voice my opinion and support what

2222
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:05,540
I think yeah I mean that's I mean that I

2223
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:06,620
know a lot of my friends like that it's

2224
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:09,350
nothing against them that's just how

2225
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:11,210
we're how the media is has made us yeah

2226
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:12,590
I think yeah I mean I think that's a big

2227
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:14,090
part of it I mean how do you how do you

2228
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:15,920
feel about the whole scenario I mean I

2229
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:16,790
know you just heard about the Eocene

2230
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,640
thing but you know what we're talking

2231
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:22,070
about dude I have mixed feelings about

2232
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:24,320
all of social media at this point like

2233
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:27,380
marketing strategies and stuff it's very

2234
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:31,760
uh I don't know what's the right word

2235
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:34,040
for it it's very uh like brainwashing

2236
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,480
cents or they make you focus on certain

2237
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,800
aspects without giving the giving you

2238
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,239
the full context and that was like the

2239
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,940
whole like political thing to you know

2240
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:42,200
like you know you can take snip like how

2241
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:43,520
much can you fully understand the full

2242
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,560
context of it if they're giving you like

2243
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,480
a ten second video mmm versus seeing

2244
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,370
everything that happen from beginning to

2245
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,570
end and it's like the same thing with

2246
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:52,820
like you know anything controversial

2247
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:56,650
when it comes to like police videos or

2248
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:59,090
you know political stuff peace eNOS like

2249
01:22:56,650 --> 01:23:01,250
everything has context behind it yeah

2250
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:03,440
but people like you said people aren't

2251
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:07,120
willing to nobody wants to have that

2252
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:09,370
open conversation yeah and it's so

2253
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:11,870
mind-boggling how people are just like

2254
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:13,160
this is my view this is my view blah

2255
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:14,450
blah blah blah blah blah and then when

2256
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,070
someone else is like well this is my

2257
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:17,239
view you're like no shut up you're wrong

2258
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:19,580
you're wrong I don't want to hear you

2259
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:21,290
you know yeah close you get just call it

2260
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:23,450
close-minded you get called things to

2261
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:25,310
instantly they people love to label yeah

2262
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:26,720
just like oh you know just like I said

2263
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:28,550
it's the holy omniscient thing it's like

2264
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,989
we're not I mean we you know since we

2265
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:32,630
are defending him because we're

2266
01:23:29,989 --> 01:23:34,520
defending him in in that not necessarily

2267
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:38,180
him that we're defending that it was

2268
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:39,830
told in a not inappropriately but it

2269
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,450
wasn't told there's like misleading it

2270
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:43,310
was misleading yes what it was and was

2271
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:45,290
what we're not known we're not defending

2272
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:47,540
his action we aren't no don't get us

2273
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:50,330
wrong yes what he did before was and I

2274
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:52,310
even and he agrees wrong is what I think

2275
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:54,500
what we're more saying is that there

2276
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:56,630
needs to be a better conversation a more

2277
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:58,070
open conversation about this or before

2278
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:59,840
we jumping on people and calling

2279
01:23:58,070 --> 01:24:02,480
labeling them racist which is a very

2280
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:04,100
serious thing yeah like people are so

2281
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,720
easy like they use that word like it's

2282
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:08,090
nothing now it's it's it's actually

2283
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:09,739
lessening the word it harms people who

2284
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:11,420
are affected by racism yeah because it

2285
01:24:09,739 --> 01:24:13,010
means almost nothing now yeah it sounds

2286
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:15,260
bad they're gonna take that clip and say

2287
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:17,630
Ryan Higa says racism means nothing

2288
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:19,730
right but you know I mean that's that's

2289
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:22,040
the thing though it's I think it's we're

2290
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:23,510
so close to labeling people and I'm not

2291
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,920
close to where it's so easy to label

2292
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:26,780
people with in this day and age and

2293
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:28,220
people do it all the time and I think

2294
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:28,880
before we do that we should really get

2295
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:30,890
our facts straight

2296
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,360
yeah yeah and including me because I

2297
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:34,640
felt like I said I fell for the same

2298
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:36,440
thing twice same here and I just wanna

2299
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:38,720
they're there were actually people who

2300
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:41,690
were talking on this article a little

2301
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:44,070
bit more deeper and one of them was an

2302
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:47,920
English footballer

2303
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:51,640
or you know for soccer player

2304
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:54,730
john barnes who more in detail talks

2305
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:58,000
about it on a news interview and like

2306
01:24:54,730 --> 01:25:00,430
the way that he presented it was like so

2307
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,280
much more insightful you know and it

2308
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:05,790
really drew to like let's have this

2309
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:08,620
conversation even even Terry Crews right

2310
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:10,390
who was like let's let's you know cuz

2311
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:12,220
black people were attacking him yeah

2312
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:13,720
like Oh Terry Crews like you know you're

2313
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:16,000
gonna get canceled you're not on our

2314
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:18,040
side but all this stuff but Terry Crews

2315
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,950
was saying like I'm not condoning his

2316
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:21,910
actions he's describing a situation so

2317
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:24,280
what do we do

2318
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:26,140
he wasn't saying like let's do this you

2319
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,400
know he wasn't trying to say like oh I I

2320
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:30,390
have the plan for everything

2321
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:32,590
he was asking his fellow people like

2322
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:34,510
what do we do about this in let's have a

2323
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:36,220
conversation yeah let's figure this out

2324
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:37,900
what's the answer and so many people are

2325
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:39,400
just like oh you don't have the answers

2326
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:41,140
you're wrong you don't have the answers

2327
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,850
that I want you're wrong that's just how

2328
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:45,370
it is that's how it is nowadays it's

2329
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:46,840
especially once you pick a side yeah I

2330
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:48,340
mean I'm trying to find a relatable

2331
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,540
scenario where once you feel like you're

2332
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:53,350
on one side you hear things differently

2333
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:55,510
oh wait say you're MGK fan or Eminem fan

2334
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:57,820
right you're naturally gonna be biased

2335
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:59,290
oh yeah and you don't you know that why

2336
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,490
can't we just see it think see things

2337
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:01,840
we're saying why can't we see things

2338
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:04,630
from both sides and it makes sense

2339
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,730
everybody has a bias and I think they're

2340
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:07,930
people need to be people need to at

2341
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:10,120
least acknowledge that they have a bias

2342
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:12,430
so that I think that alone will help

2343
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:14,590
them realize like am I being biased or

2344
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:16,510
is this actually a hundred percent

2345
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:19,180
believe in this yeah yeah I think that

2346
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:21,940
might help and it's also it's easier

2347
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:24,340
it's easier to just like be honest I did

2348
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:25,840
not listen true I think that's a huge

2349
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:27,580
thing a lot of people just like yes so

2350
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,190
much easy especially the popular side

2351
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:32,110
yeah yeah it would be so much easier to

2352
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:34,090
be like you know what he was wrong

2353
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:36,550
that's not giving the better let's jump

2354
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:38,980
on the bandwagon boycott his movie yeah

2355
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:41,170
even though like like I said we're not

2356
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:43,300
defending his actions we are defending

2357
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:44,830
how he was portrayed I think in yeah and

2358
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,430
I think that's what people are trying to

2359
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:47,020
say yeah

2360
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:49,600
same with that like that Magga had kid

2361
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:51,400
it doesn't mean we support Trump but I

2362
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,590
mean if you do great if you don't

2363
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:55,510
whatever you shouldn't have to you know

2364
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:57,200
that's that's all aside that politically

2365
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:59,780
that has nothing to do with it

2366
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,610
this kid who I mean really they'd

2367
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:03,920
screwed him yeah he's just getting death

2368
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:05,840
threats and stuff like that and the

2369
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,970
narrative was completely false from what

2370
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:10,070
I seen the videos that were cut out and

2371
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:11,540
on the news channel and stuff like that

2372
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:13,880
it's dissimilar it's a similar situation

2373
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:16,490
yeah and I think in the same essence of

2374
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:19,670
like look if we're wrong if what we're

2375
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:21,680
saying is incorrect have that

2376
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:24,320
conversation you know yeah like we're

2377
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:25,610
not saying oh like like you know that's

2378
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:28,370
why I like the comments that we have

2379
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:29,600
yeah I've had lately where people are

2380
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:32,240
addressing things that we're talking

2381
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,590
about like neo incest thing like how you

2382
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:36,800
know the last the one with Davey we're

2383
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:39,560
talking about how the last episode how

2384
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:42,320
oh you know why at what point does that

2385
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:44,150
stop being you know because of the whole

2386
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,040
peace eNOS there yeah at what point

2387
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:47,690
maybe in the future it'll be acceptable

2388
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:49,880
and people gave their opinions and

2389
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:51,470
saying why we're wrong and I we'd read

2390
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,720
them and we appreciate that like there's

2391
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:57,200
no right like just talk talk have a cup

2392
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:58,820
like Sean said have communication that's

2393
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,680
why I was gonna relate the relation

2394
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:02,930
right you know yeah well they work

2395
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,740
together yeah it doesn't have to be just

2396
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:05,420
cuz someone has an opinion

2397
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:07,310
you know how was yelling at them and

2398
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:09,170
change it how does insulting them help

2399
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:11,360
them that's my strategy I mean that I'm

2400
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:13,460
thinking about if the Democrats really

2401
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:15,740
wanted to change or really want to do

2402
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:17,600
something about Trump why keep insulting

2403
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:19,670
him it's clearly like they say oh he's a

2404
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,720
child he acts like a child you know he's

2405
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:21,830
the whole government shut down he's

2406
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,200
acting like a child

2407
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:25,910
just cuz he's not getting his way why

2408
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:27,620
are you insulting the child why are you

2409
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:28,910
like why would you do that that's not

2410
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,950
gonna work why don't you try to befriend

2411
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:32,780
the child say you know what that's a

2412
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:34,250
smart decision but here's some

2413
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:36,410
alternatives yeah I don't think he'd be

2414
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:38,000
more open to with his ego more open to

2415
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:39,590
hearing that and then just being yelled

2416
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,050
at like why would he change that's how

2417
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:43,700
everybody is to you know if you like

2418
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:45,620
more positive you work with them yeah

2419
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:47,840
they're more likely to listen to you

2420
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:49,670
exactly yep and it just so happens he's

2421
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,290
the one in power yeah so even more so

2422
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:53,060
why don't you just you know it's clearly

2423
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:55,160
not working yeah I just trying to fight

2424
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:56,690
him so why not I mean I don't know

2425
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:58,220
enough I'm not smart enough but I know

2426
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:59,300
why it's just why I don't see why it

2427
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:01,190
does someone didn't take that strategy

2428
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:03,290
like say what if this whole time Kanye

2429
01:29:01,190 --> 01:29:05,660
was actually a Democrat and he's just in

2430
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:07,520
like sucking up and it's just like I

2431
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:10,280
can't do it Kanye but he's like hey

2432
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,000
Donald you know like I'm all for you

2433
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,230
like ass

2434
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,060
port you your smart guy you're awesome

2435
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:16,880
and you don't trip he loves him yes he

2436
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:18,590
because Kanye loves loves him what if

2437
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,280
Kanye was just like a Democrat this

2438
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:21,860
whole time

2439
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:23,870
secretive right and it's all part of the

2440
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:25,550
plan and he's like you know what this

2441
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:26,990
whole government shutdown thing like you

2442
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:28,970
know what let them have the win like

2443
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:30,590
just you know I mean it's not a big deal

2444
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:32,660
like the wall like we could build the

2445
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:34,100
wall we don't absolutely make it that

2446
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:36,380
big like it let's just let's talk about

2447
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:37,160
it he would listen to Kanye more than he

2448
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:39,260
would listen to someone on the other

2449
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,760
someone yelling very sure yeah yeah I

2450
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:42,650
don't know enough actually I'm not that

2451
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,840
sure but doesn't that sound more

2452
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:47,420
appealing don't you think someone like

2453
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,440
how far these from what we see doctrines

2454
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:50,360
would be don't you think that's more

2455
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:52,280
appealing at least to somebody who they

2456
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,840
consider a kid I think that relates to

2457
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:55,250
like all problems in our lives when

2458
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,920
dealing with someone else you just got

2459
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:59,060
to be open-minded and you know yeah just

2460
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,640
like a relationship come to a compromise

2461
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:05,450
Yeah right because come on

2462
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:07,100
are we really right or or wrong mm-hm

2463
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:08,480
and if you're trying to fight so hard

2464
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:12,050
for your side like are you really

2465
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:14,090
helping you them and everyone else has

2466
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:15,950
surrounded or are you interested or are

2467
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:17,570
you just fighting for one side because

2468
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:20,150
you want to be right like we said yeah

2469
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:22,910
you know and then it all comes back to

2470
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:25,370
relationships and so ultimately you've

2471
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:30,890
got to subscribe to PewDiePie yeah and

2472
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:31,580

01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:55,550
less lost today yeah the other time I

2482
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:57,320
didn't realize until I watched the

2483
01:30:55,550 --> 01:31:00,080
podcast back I was like I say that a lot

2484
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:02,140
but I really was lost every single time

2485
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:08,270
and I didn't realize I was saying that

2486
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:11,720
anyway how do we get here dude we've

2487
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:14,300
been going for a bit yeah it's been it's

2488
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:15,830
been about an hour and should I say

2489
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:17,030
anything else you guys want to bring up

2490
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:18,440
I mean I'm Sean's here for a little bit

2491
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:19,880
we could do another one honestly but

2492
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:22,190
I'll do the second one I know maybe I

2493
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:23,570
don't this is fun this is yeah I like

2494
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:24,800
this one a lot of people are like oh

2495
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:27,770
don't agro Bob

2496
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:31,130
politics and who cares yeah it's my

2497
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:32,869
pocket I don't know I don't either but

2498
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:34,460
I'm still most knowledgeable about it

2499
01:31:32,869 --> 01:31:37,010
but yeah but we acknowledge that yeah

2500
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:38,690
and also I think it's like there's no

2501
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:39,949
we're giving our outside perspective I

2502
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:41,929
think most people don't know a lot about

2503
01:31:39,949 --> 01:31:43,250
politics hmm a lot of people know stuff

2504
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:44,449
and pretend to know more than they do

2505
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:46,520
but really they're just watching

2506
01:31:44,449 --> 01:31:48,320
Facebook videos they're regurgitating

2507
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:50,119
information they've heard exactly but

2508
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,980
they only watch one side yeah most

2509
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:54,530
people only watch one side yeah you know

2510
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:56,510
head coach you need to be open-minded I

2511
01:31:54,530 --> 01:31:58,309
think I think we're gonna buy so cuz

2512
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:59,989
we're raised in Hawaii we're we're

2513
01:31:58,309 --> 01:32:01,760
experienced us yeah you're kind of

2514
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:04,940
forced to be open-minded yeah

2515
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:06,590
and you and well-poised super laugh -

2516
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:08,570
isn't it that's what I've heard yeah

2517
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:10,309
yeah I pretty sure it is I think what

2518
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:11,510
the culture like because we had to grow

2519
01:32:10,309 --> 01:32:13,880
up with a lot of cultures and accept

2520
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:15,800
other stuff yeah look I I'd say we're a

2521
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:17,960
little more open-minded to a lot more

2522
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:20,179
things annyeong well at least for us our

2523
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:22,250
group at least very different I don't

2524
01:32:20,179 --> 01:32:23,900
know about everyone but at least I know

2525
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:26,659
between us 3 like we're a lot more

2526
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:28,670
open-minded than mmm yep jumping on

2527
01:32:26,659 --> 01:32:29,329
dangled and like it's like super quick I

2528
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:32,809
would agree

2529
01:32:29,329 --> 01:32:35,510
I would agree so do you hear um Sean's

2530
01:32:32,809 --> 01:32:37,699
accent we're actually talking that about

2531
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:39,980
that a little bit I don't even notice if

2532
01:32:37,699 --> 01:32:42,199
I mean it if you I know what I've been

2533
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:43,849

2535
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:47,119
here's a light it this is what we're

2536
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:48,920
talking about in the car and they're

2537
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:50,960
talking about pidgin I was like his is

2538
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:52,280
pidgin when we hang out it's kind of

2539
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:57,260
like it's like that little piece of

2540
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:59,599
parsley it's not too heavy

2541
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:01,849
yeah but as soon as all three of us oh

2546
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:12,800

favorite influencers just like kind of

2600
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,510
like annoy them so that they have a

2601
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:22,010
comment so they're like what is this

2602
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:24,680
what's toughest cuz we're in Vegas yeah

2603
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:27,470
so many of them are in LA but like I

2604
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:28,580
just really don't want to do this then

2605
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:31,310

you next time time to breathe no David

2610
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:45,230
said it's actually really bad for the

2611
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:46,820
mics to do that moisture but I think if

2612
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:47,990
we put like the things do anything yet

2613
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:49,770
