how was your Halloween I had the worst

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,490
time ever not one kid came to my door

36
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,650
and that's partially the reason why I

37
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,830
came late tonight because I was waiting

38
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:52,009
for people to come would you know

39
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:55,220
Halloween was yesterday uh-huh

40
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,330
that explains it explains what well I

41
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,550
was getting a lot of complaints from

42
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,500
parents because a bunch of monsters and

43
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,509
Miley Cyrus's were showing up at my door

44
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,340
so I would shoot them with a water hose

45
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:08,899
oh my god did anybody get hurt no well

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,489
at first but then these three Jonas

47
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,959
Brothers showed up at my door and I

48
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:14,060
should have known they weren't real

49
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,860
because they were all Nick but I was

50
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:21,650
just so happy because I love the Jonas

51
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:23,810
Brothers okay and then they took off

52
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,030
their faces and I realized it wasn't

53
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,739
them so I got really mad and grabbed my

54
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,440
shotgun and shot them dead

55
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,690

56
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,730

59
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,940
it was consensual and that's all that

60
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,380
