00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,080
welcome to pranking a prank er right now

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:08,550
we're gonna pray braggart hey guys so as

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,870
some of you might know we went to LA a

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,580
couple weeks ago to film some videos

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,230
with our friends and one of them was my

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,670
dare you video with our good friend use

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,020
it from fouseytube I'm sure you guys

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,699
already know what that is if you don't

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,119
you probably have at least seen one of

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,619
his videos

11
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,880
he's basically a prank er who does some

12
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,500
of the funniest pranks that I've seen

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,420
like the Mortal Kombat and the elevator

14
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,529
prank or like the yoga pants prank he's

15
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,150
done some of the biggest pranks on

16
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,010
YouTube and in addition to doing the I

17
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,480
dare you video we also decided that this

18
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,189
would be the perfect opportunity to

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,719
prank him as well give him a little bit

20
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,370
taste of his own medicine you knows now

21
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,290
we've done pranks before but we've never

22
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,610
actually done like really big well

23
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,230
thought all pranks ain't the kind that

24
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,390
he does and also we've never had to

25
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,530
prank a professional pranker before so

26
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,149
are trying had to be a little bit

27
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,559
smarter than your average prank not just

28
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,660
somebody popping out of a box and

29
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,579
scaring him okay that's exactly what we

30
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,020
did anyway luckily d-trix one of our

31
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,520
other friends let us film at his place

32
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,199
because he just so happened to have this

33
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,579
random stamp of monthly dues that they

34
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,079
sent him for some product placement

35
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,789
thing we decided to take out all of the

36
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,530
middle boxes and hollow it out and hide

37
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,030
somebody in there with a scary mask

38
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,619
that way they could pop out and scare it

39
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,000
the only thing is we were pretty sure he

40
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,890
was going to be a kind of skeptical of

41
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,030
this random Mountain Dew Mountain like

42
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,229
that's one of the first things your eyes

43
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,549
goes to when you enter that room so

44
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,930
instead of doing the scare right in the

45
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,549
beginning which is pretty predictable we

46
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,200
decide to do the scare at the very end

47
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,210
after we finished building I dare you

48
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,530
and I dare use take at least two to

49
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,790
three hours to film that means the

50
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,170
person inside of the Mountain Dew

51
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,330
Mountain had to be able to live in there

52
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,350
for about two to four hours so we also

53
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,810
have to make sure that version have

54
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,400
ventilation water or Wi-Fi of course and

55
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,540
not to mention we even put a bottle in

56
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,310
there in case he has to pee after

57
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,200
filming the Dare video we would then get

58
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,220
used up into position by basically

59
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,630
saying that we want to take a group

60
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,100
picture for the thumbnail once in

61
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,750
position the cameraman would then cue

62
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,340
the scare by saying a key phrase and

63
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,560
since YouTube is pretty tall the key

64
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,000
phrase was damn I'll taller you bro

65
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,619
and as soon as you said let us know that

66
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,110
he was on the way we set everything up

67
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,890
and then it was time to prank a

68
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,890
prankster

69
00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:00,330

70
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,400
