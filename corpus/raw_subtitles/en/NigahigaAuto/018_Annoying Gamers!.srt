1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
hey guys it's a lot of you guys already

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,560
know but I used to be a huge gamer

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,120
almost to the point of addiction I'm one

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,189
of those people that once I really get

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,170
into something I go 100 percent I get

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,910
super into it well in the past few years

7
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,469
I actually haven't played many games at

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,360
all I purposely stopped myself from

9
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,800
buying games because I I mean I was like

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,449
a drug addict if the game is in my house

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,369
I'm gonna play no matter how hard I

12
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,810
tried to even if someone hides it for me

13
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,250
I'm gonna fight I'm gonna sniff it out I

14
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,350
guess that would make me more like a dog

15
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,570
actually but like a drug addict dog in

16
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,910
the drugs are games and it's a gaming

17
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,960
dog what what am I talking about like I

18
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,579
was saying before I so rudely

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,950
interrupted myself haven't played or

20
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,309
gotten into gaming in a very long time

21
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,570
up until recently it's right I relapsed

22
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,550
I mean it's definitely not as bad as

23
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,110
before but I once again gave in to my

24
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,489
demon that is gaming and even though

25
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,680
it's been a while I think because I was

26
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,239
so into gaming in the past that once I

27
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,500
started gaming again it was it was just

28
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,270
like riding a bike I went through all

29
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,559
the stages that most gamers go through

30
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,940
in less than a week but you've ever

31
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,440
really got it into a game you know

32
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,000
exactly what stages I'm talking about

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,289
Stage one is like when you first start

34
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,090
playing and you're all like I can get it

35
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,690
I'm just playing for fun oh I died haha

36
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,250
who cares

37
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,840
stays chewed you're like I kind of got

38
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,640
it this is starting to get fun yeah each

39
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
three got it down I'm starting to get

40
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,080
pretty good Stage four I'm really good

41
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,909
actually a while Stage five I'm damn

42
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,630
good this is getting serious this is not

43
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,430
a game anymore

44
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,320
and of course stage sick this is not a

45
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,580
game anymore what are you doing if

46
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,689
you've ever really been into gaming you

47
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,220
know exactly what I'm talking about

48
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,390
don't even try to deny it isn't there's

49
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,070
nothing to be embarrassed about it

50
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
happens to the best of us the best of us

51
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,250
anyway if you guys don't already know I

52
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,020
make these videos off things that really

53
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,750
inspire and after such a long time

54
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,579
playing online has really inspired me

55
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,049
not the games but the people the gaming

56
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,520
world can be the most fun place ever but

57
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,750
at the same time if you're gonna join it

58
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,520
you also have to deal with the most

59
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,900
annoying people ever the thing is when I

60
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,119
was playing video games a few years ago

61
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,470
it was already bad it is worse now there

62
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,939
was always the same types of annoying

63
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,020
people but now there's just more of them

64
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,700
and that's why today I'm gonna be

65
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,009
talking about the most annoying gamers

66
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,380
on the internet Makoti it makes way more

67
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,720
sense to say most annoying gamers online

68
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,740
when Marvel just sounds dumb Makoti and

69
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,119
because I already know I'm gonna get

70
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,680
comments about this before I get started

71
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,540
I know a lot of these examples are gonna

72
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,610
be geared around guys and it's not meant

73
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,020
to be sexist at all I know gaming isn't

74
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,030
all

75
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,829
girl keepers - all right but these were

76
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,050
inspired from real personal experiences

77
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:10,640
and majority of the time if not all the

78
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,110
time it was a guy and let's just be real

79
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,459
there are more guy gamers and there are

80
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,050
girls at least for the games that I'm

81
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:17,510
gonna be talking about it's not sexist

82
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,599
it's just the fact I sounded bad it's

83
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,290
not that wasn't sexist I what you I'm

84
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,700
scared

85
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,170
gender equality control so this is the

86
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,430
most obvious one so I'll just get it out

87
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,510
of the way and this point everybody

88
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,190
knows what a troll is you don't have to

89
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,459
be a gamer to know what that is the goal

90
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,900
of a troll is simple to upset or anger

91
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,370
other people there are trolls everywhere

92
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,900
but in gaming they're the most

93
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,340
successful not only can they annoy you

94
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,660
with words but in a way they can also

95
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,280
annoy you physically like they can

96
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,989
actually ruin gameplay by doing things

97
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,819
like purposely blocking you so that you

98
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,140
can't move anywhere or friendly firing

99
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,489
when you hurt your own teammates and of

100
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,780
course you can't forget that trolls also

101
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:52,370
love to verbally annoy you as well

102
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,600
pretty much all just use the same nine

103
00:02:52,370 --> 00:03:02,239
year old tech like mocking everything

104
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:04,819
you say in the stupid voice for saying

105
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,609
the lamest your mom jokes dude you got

106
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:10,790
any flash banks flash bang your mom dude

107
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:16,790
that's gross your mom's gross I don't

108
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:20,239
even have a mom your mom is okay the

109
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,890
best mom is the best mr. talkie mushroom

110
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,510
this next guy I call the shiitake

111
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,859
mushroom because mushrooms are a fungus

112
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,380
and that's exactly what this guy is

113
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:28,549
talking fungus that is a menace to the

114
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,840
game like the troche you're talking

115
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,340
mushrooms aren't trying to ruin the game

116
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,630
for you they take the game serious so

117
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,340
serious at the moment something bad

118
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,450
happens they be into shiitake the entire

119
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,920
rest of the game I actually think these

120
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,209
guys are even more stupid than the

121
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,130
trolls it's almost every single one of

122
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,319
them uses the exact same unoriginal

123
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,420
overly use insults and phrases every

124
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,000
single time get ready man bro speak

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,920

127

you would hate us yeah I'm from the US

128
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,209
but I'm not gonna lie the majority of

129
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,100
these shiitake mushrooms that I came

130
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,150
across

131
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,680
90% American but I also could just be

132
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,790
the server I play and so or maybe that's

133
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,959
just because I can't understand the

134
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,060
other languages but you guys can let me

135
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,360
know the noob caller if you don't know

136
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,860
what a noob is by now then you're a noob

137
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,570
right there is exactly when new colors

138
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,550
onobu someone new to the game and new

139
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,810
cars are people who absolutely must let

140
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,840
you and everyone else in the game know

141
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,310
that he or she gender equality is a noob

142
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,420
or at least plays like one and new

143
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,650
crawlers are kind of like YouTube

144
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,090
comments they look for every single

145
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,710
little mistake so that they can call you

146
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,120
out on it well this is so fake in 6

147
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,560
minutes and 36 seconds you can clearly

148
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,700
see the fishing line they messed up they

149
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,620
were clearly wearing a different shirt

150
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,180
earlier did anyone else notice that he

151
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,440
spelled the word wrong in the title for

152
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,950
the new colors yeah we did that on

153
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:43,390
purpose

154
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:49,000
so who's the noob now that's right

155
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:51,340
you're the noob no the afk people who go

156
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,360
afk or away from keyboard may not sound

157
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,140
like the most annoying thing in the

158
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,250
world but when you're playing a game

159
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,470
online and you're playing with other

160
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,180
people going afk mid game is not just

161
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,410
annoying it's really rude but if you're

162
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,910
not gonna be playing go play

163
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,990
single-player go play with yourself

164
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,690
that's what she said

165
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,830
or he as well if you're gonna play

166
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,750
online you're playing with real people

167
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,460
so commit to it imagine going afk in

168
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:17,680
real life like say if you were on a date

169
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:18,970
so I mean what was it like oh boy AF can

170
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,440
when you're driving your friends hey

171
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,830
where are we going I think we just

172
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:27,550
missed the time or even going afk when

173
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,560
you're vlogging the excuses guy this guy

174
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,180
is so damn good and so good at

175
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,430
everything that if he ever loses or gets

176
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,750
anything wrong it's never his fault ever

177
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,860
he always has to have an excuse for

178
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,780
losing that's everything but himself

179
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,880
it's cuz my team is so bad another team

180
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,800
is definitely hacked my computer lags so

181
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,180
much it's cuz I'm so drunk right now

182
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,640
it's cuz I'm high because I let my

183
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,370
little brother play okay or or sister or

184
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,900
sister the desperate guy so like I

185
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,550
mentioned before there's a lot of girl

186
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,169
gamers but in my experience you just

187
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,790
don't come across in as often in fact

188
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:56,320
most of the time it's guys so what a

189
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,790
gamer girl reveals that she's a girl by

190
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,229
either talking on the mic or her

191
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,850
username or profile picture or whatever

192
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:02,350
that's when these guys come out the

193
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,729
desperate guys and these guys are all

194
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,110
the same they do whatever it takes to

195
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,580
get the girl's attention but just in

196
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,930
slightly different ways first off you

197
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,370
got the suck ups they go out of their

198
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,020
way to compliment every single little

199
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,950
thing she does well and cheer up for

200
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,950
every little thing she does wrong

201
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,480
nice job best kill I see all day order

202
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,530
you got the trihard guys these are the

203
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,820
guys who try to impress the girls by

204
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,030
saying how good they are at this game

205
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,290
normally but this is just their off days

206
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,510
yeah this is a this action Matt low

207
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,100
level account I have three high ranking

208
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,640
accounts like challenger low believes

209
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,870
not really and of course just like

210
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,050
anywhere else in the internet you got

211
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:40,860
the douches hey hi I got two words for

212
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,360
you what let the mic abuser I mean it's

213
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,830
pretty self-explanatory these people are

214
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,910
the reason why the mute button was

215
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,020
invented and sometimes they're not even

216
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,460
doing it on purpose they're just

217
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,900
annoying by accident they're unaware

218
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,310
that their mic is a little too close and

219
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,660
we can hear every single breath that

220
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,070
they take they get a little too into the

221
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,750
game so they start shouting which like

222
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,280
blows the speakers and your headphones

223
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,480
they top in the phone or like to anyone

224
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,070
else in the room with their mic on so

225
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,690
that we all have to listen to it and of

226
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,130

227
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,570

exactly what he told them to do he

233
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,900
thinks he's so much better than everyone

234
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,550
else in the team and we all should be

235
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,110

going in stat [ __ ] standards are

250
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,599
people that only care about their stats

they do whatever it takes to have a good

252
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,109
score but have no consideration for the

253
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:56,549
team whatsoever and last but not least

254
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:57,869

you see annoying gamers are like a virus

275
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,340
the more you come in contact with them

276
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,110
the more likely it's going to spread and

277
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,390
create even more annoying gamers until

278
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,880
