00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,370

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,080
saw I did a visual album that's 13 music

62
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,970
videos a fourth are animated and I've

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,550
been releasing one a month and I'm

64
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,110
currently working on my second that is a

65
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,050
lot for people that don't know that's a

66
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,660
lot of work for people who don't know

67
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,430
and your your you started off on YouTube

68
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,080
I sort of didn't stand up as a teenager

69
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,880
and then I started doing YouTube

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,020
simultaneously because my brother

71
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,400
actually showed me one of your videos

72
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,420
you and natalie tran and he was like

73
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,940
look at these people

74
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,940
yeah I did a video community channel

75
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,980
with her and I was like oh because when

76
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,510
you start stand-up you're doing it in

77
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,860
like laundromats or coffee shops and

78
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,690
people are very annoyed that you're

79
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,790
trying to talk to them and I was like oh

80
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,860
I can voluntarily like click on a video

81
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,390
I want to watch like I'll do that as

82
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,430
well like so I don't feel like I'm

83
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,900
harassing people all the time and so I

84
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,610
sort of really fell in love with

85
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,080
community channel in you and happyslip

86
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,090
and I was like oh I love the format that

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,040
these people are doing and so I started

88
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,530
on YouTube as well how long were you

89
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,400
doing stand-up comedy I started when I

90
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,830
was 19 so pretty young yeah about a

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,440
decade you did stand-up comedy for a

92
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:03,640
decade yeah I just recently quit to

93
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,250
transition to music so you and you're

94
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,739
saying you did that here in LA yeah so I

95
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,150
would drive out to LA and when I was

96
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:11,799
underage I had to wait outside of the

97
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,540
comedy clubs till it was my turn to go

98
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:18,820
on stage be escorted onto stage and then

99
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,930
be escorted out no idea I thought you

100
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,789
just started with YouTube

101
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,560
nono YouTube just kind of what took off

102
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:25,390
because I feel like I don't know if you

103
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,680
guys have experienced this but when

104
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,310
YouTube came around I was like oh this

105
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,750
is the only

106
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,400
place I see other Asian people doing

107
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,139
anything like comedy lifestyle Beauty

108
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,180
anything at all and I was like this is

109
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,190
so cool like I didn't I'd never seen

110
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,720
like Michelle Phan watching her video I

111
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,520
was like oh that's how I like do makeup

112
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,780
for my eyes like I've been following all

113
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,190
these other tutorials that were wrong

114
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,680
for my eye shape and so I feel like it's

115
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,820
like specific - yeah because we need to

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,860
put on like eyeliner you'd be like where

117
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,900
to go you know and so there was a

118
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,580
difference that that is all the same no

119
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,990
no it's very different doing it makeup

120
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,340
for an Asian face is different she was

121
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,870
here on the last two podcasts ago and

122
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,270
after the podcast she did stuff to our

123
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,280
faces put stuff on us yeah I don't know

124
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,850
why exactly we were just hanging out and

125
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,710
then she that the what is it called

126
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,120
eyelid yeah that stuff is awful man

127
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,520
that's worse than like when we did the

128
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,740
BGA stuff for the kpop makeup it's like

129
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,070
torture you do that to yourself every

130
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,810
day yeah every day I wouldn't you get

131
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,450
used to it you just not used to touching

132
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,340
your nerves there yeah or like if you

133
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,680
try to put in like in your waterline and

134
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,639
then you should just tattoo it so that

135
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,990
you don't have to ever do it again

136
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,000
but then if you have to do as an actor I

137
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,860
I can't cuz I have to do natural makeup

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,870
how is that going by the way it's great

139
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,690
been acting a lot been acting a lot I'm

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,740
Green Book and then I'm also I don't

147
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,160
Japanese assassin in that it's awesome I

148
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,530

that's yeah efflux is like the new thing

153
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,350
like I would rather see somebody they

154
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,510
have more consistency yeah yeah they get

155
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,160
to be edgier yeah it's really cool

156
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,039
apparently they trust creators a lot to

157
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,860
do their thing okay you you are a

158
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,750
hustler you were I mean I was reading

159
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,970
through your Wikipedia you've you know

160
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,680
come out with music you've done music

161
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,320
you've done YouTube stand-up comedy

162
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,889
acting came with your own clothing line

163
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,900
up book what like what dude do you sleep

164
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,599
I do I get seven to eight hours a night

165
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,520
and you're very uppity yeah yeah I don't

166
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,240
know I think I get like I really like

167
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,440
what I do I get bored very easily

168
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,349
so I always want to try something new

169
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,840
and exciting I really love learning and

170
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:51,199
so I see YouTube and all that stuff is

171
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,539
my own film school yeah and I also think

172
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,190
it's very fun to juggle projects because

173
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,660
when I get stuck on one I get bored I

174
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,280
can just shift to another and feel like

175
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,380
invigorated but when I go back to the

176
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,060
other project that I was stuck on before

177
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,979
and yeah you know there's like the

178
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,720
impending sense of like oh I'm gonna die

179
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:07,430
and nothing matters so like maybe I

180
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,470
should just work harder mm-hm

181
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,620
and I think I want to bring up a Twitter

182
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,360
question when it comes to that somebody

183
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,880
actually asked I just want to make sure

184
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,810
that I get the proper name and credits

185
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,389
to them

186
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,830
Caroline Road said can you walk us

187
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,659
through your creative process of making

188
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,060
videos but I wanted to kind of expand

189
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:27,259
this because when making videos it's

190
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,880
gonna be completely different from how

191
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:32,180
you do your other projects that's just

192
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,770
music or such as when you write your you

193
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,330
know short films and then start wanting

194
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:39,080
to direct them so what is the process

195
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,400
like different housing oh man so

196
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,659
differently well YouTube I'm sure you

197
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,729
know when you've been doing it for a

198
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:47,330
decade I have no ideas anymore so I

199
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:50,509
write my YouTube videos like the hour

200
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:52,580
before my crew arrives and often all

201
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:56,210
like still be finishing it as they're

202
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,190
setting up so you - I've trained myself

203
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,710
to just procrastinate till the absolute

204
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,770
last possible moment with everything

205
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,090
else I'm sort of concept based first so

206
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,560
there are certain stories like I've

207
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,870
wanted to tell forever like I did a

208
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,310
stop-motion short called dolore that

209
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,229
I've been working on for 10 years but

210
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,669
kind of accepted like stop-motion as a

211
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:16,310
craft I'll never be able to do on my own

212
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:17,719
so I waited until I had a quarter of a

213
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,099
million dollars to do it right and I

214
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:20,659
wanted to use that as sort of like a

215
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:23,360
proof of concept because I love

216
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:24,979
animation and directing and I came up as

217
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,180
a freelance storyboard artist when I was

218
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:27,650
doing stand-up so I would do like I

219
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,870
learned how to draw anime I think when I

220
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,460
was a kid and so doing storyboarding and

221
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:36,050
doing animation was like a huge part of

222
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:38,599
my childhood if you could please adjust

223
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,010
it that would be great so yeah I don't

224
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,839
know what my creative process it's been

225
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,640
very like I'm emotion driven like I feel

226
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,640
like i transmute a lot of my favorite

227
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,400
deep feelings into art so my album was

228
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,660
born out of a wanting to quit comedy

229
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,190
because people have come threatened to

230
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,110
like come shoot me at shows and comedy

231
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,350
shows don't have security every

232
00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:00,740
venues it's one of the big reasons I

233
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,779
salad reason yeah but I okay so I was

234
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,190
really afraid of like you know not only

235
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,630
putting my life on the line but somebody

236
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,870
else's life on the line especially after

237
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:11,029
christina grimmie got shot and but I'd

238
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,800
always done music in my stand-up comedy

239
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:14,390
sets and so I was like well every music

240
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,769
venue I've ever been to have security

241
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,510
like that's just something embedded in

242
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:20,360
that culture so I feel a lot safer and

243
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,070
capable of doing that and then also I I

244
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,769
went through a really rough breakup and

245
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,089
a suicidal episode and so music is sort

246
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,850
of what really helped me come out of

247
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:35,360
that and writing it as well okay let's

248
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:38,209
go back a little bit because I mean I I

249
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,410
mean I feel like that's uh DAST I mean

250
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:41,180
that's one of the one of the reasons

251
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,279
obviously there's it's not the only

252
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,690
reason why you stopped doing stand-up no

253
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,690
I mean I've been doing it for so long

254
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,820
I'm also I'm a coast comedian so my

255
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,769
stand-up sets all about my abortion my

256
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,589
sister's suicide dysfunctional Asian

257
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:57,200
family Midwest audiences don't like it

258
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:58,880
oh sure yeah so I could I was very

259
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,529
limited as a comedian and what I was

260
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,060
able to do in the audience is I was able

261
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:03,709
to reach and once I did it for ten years

262
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,760
I was like either have to really commit

263
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:06,769
to this and figure out a way to make

264
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,329
this funny to Midwest audiences or I

265
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:10,339
just have to accept that I have to step

266
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:13,790
away from comedy for a while right were

267
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:16,040
you focusing mostly on like Asian topics

268
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:19,220
or no a lot of death like a lot of my

269
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,199
comedy was death based Jews are dark

270
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,269
yeah very dark so you're saying that in

271
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:26,600
the comedy world that that when you get

272
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:28,640
that dark it's not is like Midwest

273
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,140
people want to they go to a comedy show

274
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,490
to escape so they want to hear like guys

275
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,350
are like this and girls are like this

276
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,079
whereas in LA in New York where you're

277
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,339
exposed to a lot more you are down to go

278
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,899
on that kind of journey with me like

279
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,459
you're over should further yeah like

280
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,750
you're okay to laugh at an abortion joke

281
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:43,640
whereas in the Midwest everyone's like

282
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,670
thought no that's murder

283
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,040
really Blue Collar Comedy Tour like

284
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,670
that's so wall out there yeah it's very

285
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,779
light-hearted easy to digest that's

286
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:58,579
interesting though when you so you so

287
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,320
the Christina Grimmie thing I mean that

288
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:03,350
happened how long ago like two years ago

289
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,699
yeah yeah that I mean even for me not

290
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,959
that I went to a lot of events and

291
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:06,370
traveled and stuff like that but after

292
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,589
that

293
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,360
I literally stopped yeah everything

294
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:12,070
never really did any more events since

295
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,510
that and it affected me I'm sure it

296
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,830
affected a lot of people but did really

297
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,120
like that's a big thing to you that's

298
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,610
why you one of the main reasons you

299
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,040
stopped well I've had I've had stalkers

300
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,110
over the years and one stalker when I

301
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,580
was promoting a comedy show was like I'm

302
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,279
gonna come and I have something for you

303
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,990
and he'd been emailing me all the time

304
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,910
and like started talking about how he

305
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,040
wishes my sister was alive so that he

306
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,410
could [ __ ] her and like I would be

307
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,870
jealous like he was really disturbing

308
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,170
[ __ ] and then he's he's sent an email

309
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,820
that basically alluded to the fact that

310
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,589
he had a gun and that he was gonna come

311
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,930
see me and so I was like I dropped out

312
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:48,310
of it I did I had hired a private

313
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,839
investigator but we couldn't figure out

314
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,760
who he was so we think he's actually an

315
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,220
IT because he was able to mask his IP

316
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,600
address and stuff like that Wow yeah do

317
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,690
you think that because you're I mean

318
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,100
generally your skits and your like use

319
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,630
of your comedy your sets and stuff are a

320
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,089
little bit darker do you think that's

321
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,040
why it drew somebody like that cuz I I

322
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:08,140
mean everyone we talk about girls every

323
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,150
girl we've had on the podcast has talked

324
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,459
about a stalker experience yeah but that

325
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,140
one is pretty I haven't heard one that

326
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:16,270
that's that's pretty dark well people

327
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,279
because I'm so outspoken about suicide

328
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,110
and mental illness like a lot of

329
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,060
mentally disturbed individuals latch on

330
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,930
to me like my DMS are always about I'm

331
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,760
gonna kill myself

332
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,870
my sister killed herself my brother

333
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,110
killed herself my father killed there's

334
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,640
not like so many of them are that or I

335
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,500
want to [ __ ] you in the butt or

336
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,600
something like so it's like sexual or

337
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,390
death and then I also get the people who

338
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,800
have both and so it gets a little scary

339
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,360
cuz you're like I don't know where this

340
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,440
person is how serious they are if

341
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,880
they're just sending something across

342
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,839
the internet because they can or if they

343
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,060
actually have a gun and they're gonna

344
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,490
come drive across the house effect you

345
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,380
like like it has to mess with your mind

346
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:55,570
though like yeah definitely paranoid all

347
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:57,880
the time and getting like serious like

348
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,680
yeah yeah they're so casual ball which I

349
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,750
find funny but I know it's not funny

350
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,250
yeah I mean I was a girl you just get

351
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,050
used to a certain level of danger in

352
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,029
everyday life mm-hmm but I also feel

353
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,890
like with your stand-up background you

354
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,390
kind of take like that pain or like that

355
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,950
awkwardness and you turn it into

356
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,450
something that you know can be seen more

357
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:19,390
lighthearted yeah I try but also um

358
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,080
nevermind forgot my question okay all

359
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,149
right

360
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,930
I just think there's like if I were in

361
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:27,430
your position and in getting DMS about

362
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,070
like not the sexual stuff I mean that I

363
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,810
wouldn't yeah that's like me but more

364
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,290
about the II like the more deeper stuff

365
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:38,290
like I would feel a very heavy burden my

366
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:41,079
shoulders and and I wouldn't know how to

367
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,490
deal with that like do you I mean I'm

368
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:45,430
sure you kind of have to go through

369
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:48,490
things like that and and it's not like

370
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:51,579
you could save everyone you know I mean

371
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,019
we all want to but I mean I how do you

372
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:55,930
kind of deal with that like it's it's

373
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:58,300
very there's another question actually

374
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,130
yeah I wouldn't know how to so yeah

375
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,290
therapy man like I've been in therapy

376
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,910
for ten years and I think it's great and

377
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,010
my therapist was like do not respond to

378
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,720
any of those people

379
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,490
yeah she was like first of all someone

380
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,990
who's very seriously considering suicide

381
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,000
is most likely not going to send that

382
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,740
out on the internet they are you know

383
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,240
internal and they create a plan and you

384
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,100
don't see it coming and she's like

385
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,200
second of all if you respond once that

386
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,640
person becomes relying on you and it's

387
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,930
gonna guilt you into having to respond

388
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,779
to them every time and also for my

389
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,300
mental health like I can't like I've had

390
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:30,279
friends who have used the suicide thing

391
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,920
it's like a way to get me to do things

392
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,270
or they're like emotionally manipulative

393
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,430
because they know that's my trigger and

394
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,990
so now I'm just like I can't engage like

395
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,220
if someone's is very seriously suicidal

396
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,750
I know them and they're my friend like I

397
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,070
know how to be there for them but if

398
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,110
you're a stranger on the internet I

399
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,300
cannot help you in that way right yeah

400
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,579
you gotta go to therapy on the record I

401
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,910
want I promise that was my question

402
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:54,459
totally forgot blanked out of my you

403
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,560
went from your head into Davis because

404
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,510
like a lot of people do deal with like

405
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,670
people reaching out to them and saying

406
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:04,209
oh I'm very depressed and it's just like

407
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:06,160
how do you mentally like oh is this my

408
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:09,040
issue you know so I think for a lot of

409
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,510
content creators hearing that it can

410
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,149
guide them through like oh this is not

411
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,750
for me it's not my burden to take care

412
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,910
of yeah

413
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,070
I've come to the same conclusion I think

414
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,529
to not respond but I've definitely had

415
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,670
like moments like I know I like DMS

416
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,140
where I don't want to open it because

417
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,000
they'll see that I've read it and didn't

418
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,790
do anything about it like the top line

419
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,520
is like I really need to talk to you

420
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,980
because I like I'm contemplating suicide

421
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,490
and like I feel a sense of like even

422
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,649
guilt

423
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,990
not opening it but I know it's not gonna

424
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,550
help to do that because like what's to

425
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,350
stop from the next like hundred of them

426
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,260
you know when I just open that one and

427
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,540
then I'm just caught up in this I never

428
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,800
actually talked about this before but I

429
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,959
came to the conclusion not to open it

430
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,520
but I do feel like guilt you know

431
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,130
because like I don't know what happened

432
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,070
to that person you know and like what if

433
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,320
I had opened it and just said one thing

434
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,270
and they're fine I know I think he just

435
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,610
said I we I came to the same conclusion

436
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,470
but I did always have a little bit of

437
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,959
guilt of not opening it cuz it's not

438
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:11,350
that hard you do but I guess hearing you

439
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,029
from it I should go see a therapist but

440
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,560
the thing is like yes I understand your

441
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:17,589
guilts you're like well I have the power

442
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,510
to influence person yeah but the thing

443
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:21,820
is then that becomes all-consuming

444
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,890
because times that by like a thousand

445
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,660
times it by a hundred thousand and it's

446
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,190
like then what happens if you say

447
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,959
something and then they kill themselves

448
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,209
now you have the opposite go effect

449
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,279
you're not a licensed like psychiatrist

450
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:34,870
you don't know what to tell people and

451
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,820
so for me it's like I will make my

452
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,959
videos and I'll be vocal about these are

453
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,459
the things you can do here are the

454
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,649
solutions for depression here's here's

455
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:43,450
the resources you have but I can't be

456
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,520
accountable I'm not trained for that

457
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,170
right yeah that's fair yeah I had a

458
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,450
conversation with another content

459
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,760
creator we kind of came to the idea of

460
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,800
the time spent like helping us one

461
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,810
person where you're completely unsure of

462
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,640
what you're doing if you just focus on

463
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,730
the stuff that you usually do you help

464
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,829
like way more people and that's stuff

465
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,720
that you're good at so it's just like if

466
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:07,120
you keep doing your thing you'll you'll

467
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,920
be positively impacting a lot more

468
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,839
people definitely well you said that

469
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,220
that's like one of uh obviously you have

470
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,030
personal reasons that that's a trigger

471
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,500
yeah with your sister but like you said

472
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,220
you also talk about it in stand-up

473
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,150
mm-hmm how is that so I mean I know it's

474
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,550
obviously personal to you and that's

475
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,809
probably why you use it but if it's a

476
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,569
trigger to you don't you think that

477
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:30,400
that's kind of you know a touchy subject

478
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:32,470
for you yeah I couldn't make a suicide

479
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,000
joke for seven years so I was doing

480
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,410
stand-up for seven years before I could

481
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,150
actually make a joke about it and laugh

482
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,890
and so then it became a thing of like

483
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,990
ooh I like that it doesn't have this

484
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,700
power over me anymore because before any

485
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,260
time someone would colloquially mention

486
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,520
in conversation like oh her head is in

487
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,500
traffic for one more moment I was gonna

488
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,520
kill myself

489
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,590
I would just feel crazy and I got to a

490
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,420
point where I finally was like oh okay

491
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,220
if I can make it funny if I can find a

492
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,570
lens to laugh at it and to allow other

493
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,700
people to laugh at it that's so

494
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,620
empowering for me and it's also normal

495
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,290
I think suicide ideation should be more

496
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,720
normalized because all of us we're so

497
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,160
isolated every day we don't we're not in

498
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,780
the food chain anymore so you just like

499
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,490
live this weird existence where you're

500
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,990
watching everyone's best lives on your

501
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,760
screen alone in your [ __ ] bedroom

502
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,080
feeling like a loser I feel like a lot

503
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,880
of us go through periods of depression

504
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,500
and wanting to kill ourselves and

505
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,630
wondering if our life means anything and

506
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,890
there's been sort of this alarmist view

507
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,690
like oh god if you have any of those

508
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,520
thoughts you're freaked and like you

509
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,530
need to be on medication and you need to

510
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,180
like go to therapy because you're crazy

511
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,530
whereas I'm like no I'm pretty sure

512
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,110
everyone gets to a point in their lives

513
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,610
maybe once or many times where it even

514
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,710
just crosses your mind like should I

515
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,030
kill myself and so I like to try to

516
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,420
normalize those feelings while also

517
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,340
pointing out that that's not the answer

518
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,560
yeah I mean I agree with that I think

519
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,910
everybody I always assumed growing up

520
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,490
because even as a little kid I didn't

521
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,480
understand it really but I like

522
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,770
contemplated not doesn't mean I was

523
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,970
gonna do it and I just you know

524
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,160
everybody has those thoughts I thought

525
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,120
everybody would have those but maybe not

526
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,400
I don't know I've thought about it

527
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,020
everybody has and you're like I think

528
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,000
even in the opposite side of that

529
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,470
spectrum like we've all had like a small

530
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,910
thought like man I really want to kill

531
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,340
that person yeah but you know you

532
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,020
shouldn't do that every time I hold a

533
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,810
knife and I'm by someone like I could

534
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,880
just stab ya that's wrong or like like

535
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,740
we're driving you're like there's a

536
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,990
bicycle and everything like yeah it's go

537
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,660
Lane you're like oh my god nd yeah I

538
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,910
could get one star in GTA right now it's

539
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,460
crazy like when you're driving the only

540
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,510
thing that's stopping both cars on the

541
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,310
other side is just a lion just one line

542
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,720
sometimes it's it's dashed it's not even

543
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,490
a solid line yeah you could just

544
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,080
literally just go left and there the

545
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,080
person goes left

546
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:53,830
just a line it's just a line so you know

547
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:53,830
life is life can be short never know go

548
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,640
dark deed wasn't she brought the first

549
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:03,970
Twitter question you might keep rolling

550
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,870
with that oh no it's just like you're

551
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,580
something because usually we do Twitter

552
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,850
questions in the end where there's good

553
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,980
questions there's interesting fans

554
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:16,850
there's a tweet here it's you actually

555
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,100
your tweet July on July 7th you wrote

556
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,809
money fame success status oh [ __ ]

557
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,000
disappears and has forgotten how you

558
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:25,220
help people inspire others empower and

559
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,870
amplify voices other than your own the

560
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,850
extent of your kindness that's the [ __ ]

561
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,450
legacy is made of I really like that

562
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,299
thank you

563
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:35,240
like what prompted you to like come up

564
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:36,799
with this this sort of tweet um I I

565
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,169
think we all get caught up in the game

566
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,970
of oh I gotta be more successful I gotta

567
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:42,890
make more money I got it you know do all

568
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,809
the cool things and then you lose sight

569
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,789
of what is actually important and I feel

570
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,440
like life is this really annoying cycle

571
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:51,529
of doing that again and again and again

572
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,620
and that was just a reminder for me cuz

573
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:55,970
I was looking at Instagram obviously and

574
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,110
like looking at things everyone else was

575
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,399
doing I was like am i doing everything

576
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,140
wrong like should I be doing more of

577
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:02,419
like what this is or be more of like who

578
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,520
this person is and just feeling like I

579
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:05,809
feel very lame a lot of the times I feel

580
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,460
like everyone's so much funnier and

581
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,049
smarter and like or inspiring or

582
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,940
whatever and I just never feel like I am

583
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:12,710
doing enough and so that to me I was

584
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,210
like you know what I can only affect as

585
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,090
much as I can affect like there's a

586
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,679
really good quote by Mother Teresa that

587
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,480
was like I alone cannot change the world

588
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,460
but I can cast a stone and create many

589
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,529
ripples and to me that's that's always

590
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,730
the way I try to live is like you know

591
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:26,990
it gets really overwhelming when you

592
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,730
watch the news and you're like I want to

593
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,470
help the world but I can't so it's like

594
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,000
well I can only cast as many ripples and

595
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,980
hopefully those people cast ripples as

596
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,380
well and try to be a positive force in

597
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,299
the world because I feel like apathy has

598
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,640
become very cool like let me not care

599
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:42,620
let me know vote little bit but I'm like

600
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,789
well in 11 years global warming is gonna

601
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,409
be at the point of no return you guys

602
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:48,830
like let's let's all chip in let's all

603
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:51,470
care um so yeah I think that was just me

604
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:53,539
reminding myself like don't get caught

605
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,789
up in that [ __ ] too much what what

606
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:58,669
like you know you've done a lot of

607
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:01,490
things in what what's driving you to

608
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:03,919
like do so many things I think earlier

609
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,159
you said you get bored pretty easily but

610
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,950
but what is it inside of you that that

611
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:14,080
that feels like makes you feel like you

612
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:16,880
you need to do all of these things

613
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,100
really ambitious kid like I remember my

614
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,960
first dream was to be the first female

615
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,000
president of the United States like when

616
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,590
I was five I was like that is my path I

617
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,950
am Amy Poehler before Amy Poehler

618
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,980
existed and I've always just felt like I

619
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:32,090
want to do great things for Humanity and

620
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,399
ultimately I've realized like my

621
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:35,480
strength is taking my life experience or

622
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:36,710
taking things that I'm feeling and

623
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,169
turning that into art that can hopefully

624
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:42,409
like make people feel less alone or

625
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:44,090
inspire them and so for me I love

626
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:45,380
playing in different mediums because

627
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,000
then you get all your life experience

628
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,559
and in a new medium it's all up for

629
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
grabs again like versus YouTube I'm like

630
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,049
I've talked about every topic there is

631
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,610
to [ __ ] talk about I don't have

632
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:54,230
anything else to say but if I go to

633
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,909
music I'm like everything I've ever gone

634
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,919
through is now up for grabs I can say

635
00:22:55,909 --> 00:23:00,470
all of that again in just a new medium

636
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,750
and so I like I like medium hopping as

637
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,010
well I think it keeps you creative so

638
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,019
what are you gonna do when you run out

639
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:12,889
of all of those feelings that you can

640
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:15,139
sing afro I don't have right you may

641
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:16,429
come back to the other medium yeah when

642
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:20,000
you have more things to talk about yeah

643
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:22,460
but that is interesting though and it I

644
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,840
feel like you have to have there's

645
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,630
certain people in the world I feel like

646
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,289
just have more energy than others and I

647
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,909
feel like you're one of those people

648
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,679
there's like you know the people you

649
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,480
watching it's like like Kevin Hart right

650
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,429
buddy like you're just looking like man

651
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,139
how can he do all these things I call it

652
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:37,909
how does he have the mental capacity is

653
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:39,529
that something you've always had that's

654
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:40,580
like like you said as a little kid or is

655
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:43,549
it something that you had to like train

656
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:46,039
yourself prolific nasai feel comes from

657
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:48,049
organization and attention management so

658
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:51,289
I'm very very good at time management I

659
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:52,970
can structure my time in a way that I'm

660
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:54,919
like oh this is how I can maximize the

661
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,269
amount that I can do some day is like

662
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:57,620
I'm tired and I don't want to do

663
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,750
anything and I clear my schedule and I

664
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,059
just like lay around but for the most

665
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,130
part I'm very good at when I have a task

666
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:05,870
to do I know exactly how to do it in the

667
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,730
most efficient way possible you don't

668
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,100
get lost in that like you know a lot of

669
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,539
artists once you're like in a zone

670
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,230
nothing else matters you just keep going

671
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:13,610
until

672
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,160
you realize I just used up my whole day

673
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:19,100
you don't go through that I do but like

674
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,780
I I do it a per project so I get very

675
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,000
obsessed with one project I complete it

676
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,890
and then I do all my others I see oh

677
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,250
well that's discipline then at that

678
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,860
point

679
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,720
ya have the opposite thing I get excited

680
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,860
about things get into it jump onto

681
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,320
something else kind of forget about it

682
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,480
come back just I'm everywhere I think

683
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,070
that's a good process too if that's what

684
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,280
works for you it's better to just finish

685
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,330
things have a lot of unfinished things I

686
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,470
was like this is a great idea and

687
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,700
sometimes I'll forget about it come back

688
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,650
and be like man I should did that back

689
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,350
when it was relevant yeah sometimes you

690
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:51,380
got a we work off the muse energy yeah I

691
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,330
have those too yeah do you like being

692
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,370
crude II like the business aspect of

693
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,220
what you do I do

694
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:01,160
and versus a creative I mean is it like

695
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,350
a 50/50 thing for you yeah I really like

696
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,610
like Excel spreadsheets and

697
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:08,780
color-coordinated calendars because your

698
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:11,090
organization though that's like so left

699
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,530
brained you know it's fun it's a relief

700
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,690
from creative because there's like oh

701
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,309
there's one way to do this right and if

702
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,470
I numbers don't add up then I have done

703
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:20,240
the math wrong whereas creative like the

704
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,790
box there's no box so you're like oh

705
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,169
you're anything yeah where's the

706
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:26,840
business side gives me a break from all

707
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:29,510
that and I can be like let budget so you

708
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,320
enjoy that so yeah I personally think

709
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:35,030
that like there if you you have to have

710
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,520
a little bit of that like a little bit

711
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,320
of organization to become a successful

712
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,570
creative because if you don't have that

713
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,919
or some sort of structure in your life I

714
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,660
feel like what you just said you know

715
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,169
when you're treated it's just there's no

716
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:50,720
walls it's just like oh yeah energy that

717
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:52,130
just goes outward but you have to kind

718
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,650
of bring it in and be like okay I'm

719
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:59,780
gonna use this energy to create a song

720
00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:01,640
oh yeah film or a script so I think that

721
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,900
that's super important yeah I mean I

722
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,669
have so many friends who are like way

723
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,490
more talented than I am they just don't

724
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:09,260
have the discipline every day to like

725
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,410
stick either follow through just likes

726
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:14,120
finish something or their perfectionist

727
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,740
and they like just finish it over and

728
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,210
over and over again until they hate it

729
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,710
and they throw the whole thing away and

730
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,299
I think for me it's always like I want

731
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,950
to be at least 90% there and then I have

732
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:23,960
to let it go like nothing's ever gonna

733
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,159
be perfect so let it go once it's 90% of

734
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,029
the way there I mean obviously if

735
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,099
there's anything glaring

736
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:29,659
you want to fix yes but I also know when

737
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:31,909
to be like okay this has been enough

738
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:35,509
time on this leg move on yes

739
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:38,029
so I read in your bio that your your

740
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:40,119
father was an officer in the United

741
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:44,299
States Marine corpse

742
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:50,479
thanks thanks to him thank you

743
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:52,999
Thank You mr. O'Connor do you think like

744
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:55,340
because I have friends who grew up in

745
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:56,899
military families as well they travel

746
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,999
all over the place they're never in one

747
00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:00,769
place it's hard for them to make friends

748
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:01,789
there go to different schools all the

749
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:04,399
time

750
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:07,849
but the thing that I respect about them

751
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:08,749
is they're very well cultured and and I

752
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,979
think that's something that people who

753
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:12,919
travel a lot you know to really

754
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:17,210
understand is you just have a general

755
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:19,609
idea of just people yeah like a really

756
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:23,149
good balance of like understanding of

757
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:24,889
people do you feel that I mean were you

758
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:27,289
traveling a lot and oh yeah every six

759
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:30,559
months to two years Wow so it was really

760
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:32,839
difficult to I liked it you like I like

761
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,789
decks like even as a kid yeah and I was

762
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:36,619
like oh I get some believe and I can

763
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:38,629
become whoever I want to be at this new

764
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:39,950
school understand yeah I think I'm an

765
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:42,200
actor because I'd be like I'm gonna be

766
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,190
the shy girl here in North Carolina and

767
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,629
there's like I don't like being the shy

768
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,419
girls like I'm gonna be the obnoxious

769
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:49,659
about in here in Hawaii committed to it

770
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:51,679
yeah I stayed in character for those

771
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:53,419
yeah I was like a chance to like

772
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,129
reinvent yourself over and over again

773
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:57,019
until you found out like what you liked

774
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:58,999
what you didn't like about yourself and

775
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:00,559
I got very good at chameleon ink so I

776
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:02,269
could see I can read a room and be like

777
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,969
I know exactly who I have to be to fit

778
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:06,580
in or I can just be myself

779
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:09,469
so you know who your base is then yeah

780
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,460
that is that you right now yeah yeah I

781
00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:13,279
mean I'm a little turned up because

782
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:16,070
we're performing but yeah yeah um yeah

783
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:24,409
and cuz you drink some milk and tea and

784
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:25,849
water no that's that's do you do you

785
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:28,190
feel like the discipline also came from

786
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:30,200
being in a like having your father being

787
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:33,200
a yeah I mean I think I had the perfect

788
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,779
bifurcation of show and business so my

789
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,609
dad was all like every page you read you

790
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:39,500
get a penny if you like pluck the weeds

791
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:42,440
in the yard for two days I'll give you

792
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,390
Titanic on VHS and so he taught me like

793
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,730
hard work and discipline and like really

794
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:49,070
valued education and my mom is like more

795
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,169
of a flowy like really funny clown type

796
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,210
who loves artistry so she was always

797
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:55,610
either painting or doing crochet or like

798
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,620

00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:00,440
with both like discipline but also like

800
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:02,090
a really big emphasis on creativity that

801
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,590

of this do you think Paco is cute it had

828
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:31,789
the most parts it did he got like

829
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,919
married to the top nice I said it as a

830
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:37,030
joke and to send it and he actually sent

831
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,770
it so oh you tweeted it at yourself with

832
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:41,299
questions to ask yes okay I thought

833
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,130
you're just asking your audience in

834
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:46,280
third person and maybe not you're cute

835
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,380
you can be honest you don't have to make

836
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,570
him feel good actually even the stall

837
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,470
makes me real good that's kind of the

838
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:58,350
theme of this boss guys

839
00:30:52,470 --> 00:31:00,120
cute Wow sound effects cuz again the

840
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:04,230
theme was that he just made his life I

841
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:08,570
think I'm good yeah I would say you're

842
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:11,490
objectively Q dark joke you know

843
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,299
nobody's they objectively motion right

844
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,830
now

845
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:16,110
that means like Oh personally I don't

846
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:19,380
find you you know I can see okay you're

847
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:21,799
an attractive man yeah yeah thank you I

848
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,570
appreciate that but objectively I was

849
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:26,429
I'm just talking about physicality like

850
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,409
in terms of like if I'm personally

851
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:30,900
attracted to a person when I think women

852
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:32,130
have the capacity to fall in love with

853
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,049
people who aren't attractive and they

854
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,730
become attractive to them based on your

855
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:36,900
personality so for me I can see a guy

856
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,850
who's really hot and like that's a hot

857
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,289
guy but I don't feel anything until I

858
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,659
know them I mean I could say that what

859
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:44,640
guy - yeah but speaking about that we

860
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:47,460
also have in our notes recently in 2018

861
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,039
that you came out at a Streamy award

862
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,110
show I did that you are by I am bisexual

863
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,880
I actually didn't see that clip but I

864
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:57,419
just we just looked it up okay

865
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,090
yeah I saw the video of you coming out

866
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,960
to your parents yeah that was that cute

867
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:04,230
yeah thank you

868
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,480
your parents are very very sweet they

869
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,370
seemed very like very sweet people so

870
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,919
I've asked them to do another video and

871
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:12,720
they're like not yet we just not yeah

872
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:14,640
yeah they're like we need we need some

873
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:21,510
more space people need to like miss us

874
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:23,400
more okay something you knew for like a

875
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,549
long time hey but you just didn't want

876
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,039
to say it so I had a crush on a girl

877
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:30,539
when I was like 11 or something and my

878
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,390
friend I told my friend and she was like

879
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:34,770
Ana you're just trying to be interesting

880
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,390
she said yeah so for a long time I

881
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,820
thought like oh I'm just a straight girl

882
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:41,730
trying to be like interesting what you

883
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,020
didn't even know no and I'm bisexuality

884
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,730
I thought you had to be like half in

885
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,890
half and I'm not half and half I skew

886
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,870
more male and but in talking to some

887
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:50,909
bisexual ladies in the last year or so

888
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:52,500
they were like no like any amount of my

889
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:54,270
sexuality is valid like I have a friend

890
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,679
who's predominantly a lesbian but she's

891
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,150
attracted to like a guy here and there

892
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,590
and she's like I'm still very much

893
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,419
bisexual I don't identify as a lesbian

894
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,970
it's like a spectrum right yeah it's a

895
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:04,380
huge spectrum and no one's like on the

896
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,790
very opposite end

897
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,010
no because if you're on the opposite on

898
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:10,140
your gay it was like by is like I'm

899
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,150
attracted to both but it may not be the

900
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,010
same amount per and obvious I think it's

901
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:17,370
like actually very rare to have like an

902
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:21,870
exact 50/50 you'll have fun interesting

903
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:23,430
sorry that I I didn't know this but I do

904
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:25,200
you did you get a lot of pushback from

905
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:27,030
the gay community because there is

906
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,370
pushback there and they feel like it's

907
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:31,320
so interesting to me because it took so

908
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,480
long for you to accept gay people and

909
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,820
then now that the people are coming on

910
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,100
is by gay people there's some actual

911
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,240
pushback yeah by people they think like

912
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,770
straight people think it's either a

913
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,290
stepping stone to being gay and gay

914
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:45,450
people think like you're actually

915
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:47,970
straight and just like having fun with

916
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,350
the other two generous selfish yeah it's

917
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,090
selfish or whatever and there's this

918
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,680
funny like I think being by an Asian I

919
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:57,450
was like I have both invisibility things

920
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:59,040
maybe I just don't woman but yeah I have

921
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,450
had some pushback from gay people like

922
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,830
especially cuz they're like well have

923
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,480
you ever had sex with a woman have you

924
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,920
ever dated a woman I was like do I need

925
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,630
to ever have sex with a guy to know that

926
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,240
I'm attracted to a guy like that's not a

927
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:11,460
thing like it's just ridiculous um but

928
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,919
it's fun it's been a fun journey when

929
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,300
you said you were 11 right was it 11

930
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,419
yeah I think so you said you had a crush

931
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,850
on a girl I I don't know about the

932
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:22,679
anatomy of a female like in terms of

933
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,899
like sexually when you start feeling

934
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,450
sexual desire mm-hmm

935
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:30,570
then I want to press your face to their

936
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:33,440
face okay so so I'm sunni what hasn't

937
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:39,679
done that yet yeah I'm in experience but

938
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,679
when when you're 11 you weren't sexual

939
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:50,370
like that's like puberty right like even

940
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:52,860
like it's great great okay wait I was

941
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:55,110
reading like naughty novels I stole from

942
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,760
my mom yeah why you had to grow up fast

943
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,149
right because you're traveling all over

944
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,030
the place

945
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:04,890
yeah yeah I don't know I'm just assuming

946
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:09,450
so when you were 11 you did have like a

947
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:10,860
sexual kind of like desire for the other

948
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,990
girl that yeah I don't know if I was

949
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,760
like I wanted to [ __ ] her when I was 11

950
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,220
but I definitely like I liked her like I

951
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,930
want to kiss her you want to

952
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,119
okay yeah it wasn't like oh she's so

953
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:21,500
pretty like I want to know she was she

954
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,090
was like more of a butch girl she was

955
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,119
more of a tomboy gosh I've always been

956
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:27,290
much more into tomboys yeah what I've

957
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,590
always been like kind of curious about

958
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:33,560
that like what what draws a girl into a

959
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:36,460
butch girl versus like a more pretty

960
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:39,140
very pretty like whatever I'm in

961
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,760
feminine girl I don't know I guess to me

962
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,280
like tomboys have always been like

963
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,840
they're cute and they're edgy and like

964
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,490
they're a little rough and tumble and

965
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,920
they have really good hair that's like

966
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:51,500
short but it's like gorgeous and and Oh

967
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,910
quaff and I don't know I feel like yeah

968
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:57,590
I want to sit on the back of her

969
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:59,180
skateboard or something though the way

970
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,680
that like you kind of like portray

971
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,170
yourself is like you're very edgy

972
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,660
yeah aspect and a lot of times people

973
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:07,790
will say Oh opposites attract no does

974
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,560
that mean like if it's true in your case

975
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,670
that opposites attract that I guess in

976
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,070
your more personal life you're kind of

977
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,810
more docile and like you're very no I

978
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:17,060
mean I don't know I'm very masculine

979
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,010
energy in my career so I feel like I

980
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,660
have attracted a lot of women who are

981
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,920
more feminine but I know in my

982
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,890
relationships I need to be the more

983
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,330
feminine one because I get I get to like

984
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,770
resentful if I have to be the one who

985
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,109
plans everything and does everything and

986
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,790
controls the relationship so I think

987
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:33,260
I've been always attracted to types that

988
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,670
have more of that masculine energy

989
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,200
because I'm like oh I can like relax in

990
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,720
my relationship but then like have my

991
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,990
masculine energy in my career yeah

992
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,359
interesting so you I mean you're pretty

993
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,820
openly like a very strong feminist right

994
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:48,200
yeah but you still see well I mean I

995
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,940
know there's different definitions of

996
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,140
feminist these days like it doesn't not

997
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,640
everybody has the same definition but

998
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,470
like in terms of like in that

999
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,300
relationship you're just describing like

1000
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,500
having a guy have it to plan those

1001
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,990
things you don't think those roles

1002
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:03,020
should be equally split up between the

1003
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:05,240
man and woman no I'm a feminist in the

1004
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:07,130
sense that I advocate for equality for

1005
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,869
women but also for equality for men in

1006
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,780
the sense of emotional vulnerability

1007
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:13,609
like I think feminism is also trying to

1008
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,200
get rid of toxic masculinity so I have

1009
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:17,420
been attracted to men who are like kind

1010
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,800
of feminine in their energy it really

1011
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,900
just depends I mean there's so many

1012
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,000
variations of like what can get along

1013
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,880
with a person but I do know in my

1014
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,890
relationships like I can be so I'm such

1015
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,339
a controlling calculated person already

1016
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,410
that I want someone who can

1017
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:33,390
sort of not be pushed around by my

1018
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,710
energy and can push back just like me I

1019
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,190
wouldn't actually want somebody who

1020
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:40,289
would be no no ya know what the fight

1021
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,450
not even just a fight but someone who

1022
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:44,579
can like you know have a boundary and

1023
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,349
hold their boundary but it's also and

1024
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:48,180
this is what I got also from like Ali

1025
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:50,430
Wong special is because she's somebody

1026
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,920
who's also very much so like driven yeah

1027
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,779
calculating in that aspect but they want

1028
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,999
to be like it's almost like not

1029
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:59,339
necessarily the opposition but that they

1030
00:37:56,999 --> 00:38:01,019
can respect the other person yes okay

1031
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:03,269
all right it's not gonna be easy I don't

1032
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:04,890
just get to control my own yeah like you

1033
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:06,089
want someone who like it feels like you

1034
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,680
you know you're an equal like I've

1035
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:09,660
financially supported partners before

1036
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,339
and it just doesn't I just hate it and

1037
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,719
so I need someone who's confident in who

1038
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:14,009
they are and who's doing their own thing

1039
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:15,239
and is down to be like no we're not

1040
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:17,880
gonna do that I don't want to do that

1041
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:20,059
okay Co Co Co Co Co but you won't push

1042
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,789
back you like push back for sure

1043
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:25,410
that's interesting because that aspect

1044
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:27,420
of like that you're still working

1045
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:30,329
towards something you know you know that

1046
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,940
oh they're invested in this yeah I like

1047
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:34,979
debate I guess like one of the thoughts

1048
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,380
I have with the whole bisexuality thing

1049
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,630
is that me correct me if I'm wrong but

1050
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,910
me do you kind of see it as like you

1051
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:44,489
don't see guy and girl you kind of just

1052
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:48,599
see personality and kind of what they

1053
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:51,529
stand for and then you because I like

1054
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,910
when do you choose to date a dude versus

1055
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:57,660
date a woman you know a woman yeah like

1056
00:38:53,910 --> 00:39:00,450
like or is it like leaning more towards

1057
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,910
male I date more men mm-hmm I have been

1058
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:04,440
dating women since I've come out and I'm

1059
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,759
sure they're very different they're so

1060
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,930
different I made a video about I hope

1061
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:08,430
it's not gonna be offensive but it's

1062
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:12,450
called like I've dated women and now I

1063
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:14,130
understand men because in cousin I like

1064
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,440
would take women out on dates and they

1065
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:18,269
never offered to pay for they're having

1066
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,229
dinner or like interesting yeah and I

1067
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:20,880
would be like what the [ __ ]

1068
00:39:19,229 --> 00:39:21,900
and like I was talking to my male

1069
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,400
friends like I feel like this girl's

1070
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,539
just asking me out so like I'll buy her

1071
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,210
dinner cuz you always suggest he's like

1072
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:28,769
nice restaurants like I'm like what the

1073
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,710
[ __ ] and he was like oh yeah that's the

1074
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:33,539
thing women do yeah what is it how did

1075
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,219
you decide that I mean between you two

1076
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:37,670
like why didn't you be the one like I'm

1077
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:39,660
not gonna pay well I've felt awkward

1078
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,660
also are you gonna want that ask them

1079
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,170
out no she asked me out

1080
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:48,810
Wow you got you got I got but but that

1081
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:51,210
was just one experience with one lady

1082
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:53,190
yeah but with other women it's been like

1083
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,420
I had someone invite me in and she was

1084
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,099
like do you want to come in and make out

1085
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,839
I was like yeah all right pretty

1086
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:59,849
whatever and then she just talked the

1087
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,380
lake till 3 a.m. which I don't mind but

1088
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:06,690
like I was like we're not making out at

1089
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:08,400
all you're a liar what if what if a guy

1090
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,680
like what is more of a guy thing what if

1091
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,080
the guy said the same thing then I would

1092
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,550
expect to make out exactly what it would

1093
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,589
have happened no more than that guy

1094
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:18,780
brings you in then he talks about his

1095
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:20,609
emotions till 3 who are you more mad at

1096
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,599
the guy or the girl oh I think it would

1097
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:23,220
depend on what they're talking about

1098
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,859
like the girl was talking about it was

1099
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:28,260
it was same thing I would probably be

1100
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:30,839
pissed too well the thing is the premise

1101
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,020
of bringing me into the house with

1102
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:35,070
promises of kissing thing yeah like if

1103
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,810
you just said you want to come in and

1104
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,880
talk I would be like yeah cool unlike

1105
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,440
expect talking but to say let's make out

1106
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,290
and then only talk to me until 3:00 a.m.

1107
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,480
I'm like I gotta go just tender people

1108
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,740
know I can't do tinder so I do riah

1109
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,780

1110
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,780
Rai is like people in the industry oh

1111
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:58,200
yeah so you're talking about other

1112
00:40:54,359 --> 00:41:00,750
actresses actors directors DPS people

00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,910
who are on gaffers gaffers that's

1114
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,500

1116
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,690

1118
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:14,640

1119
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,310
answered um when do you choose a girl

1120
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,670

it's a mix you're going back and yes

1129
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:38,400
okay it just depends on like who's cool

1130
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:40,410

1131
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,540
when we meet up for dinner finally like

1132
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:44,580
dating in LA is its own special thing so

1133
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,530
it's kind of awful and this about that

1134
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:49,260
no so I don't know what that mean oh my

1135
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:52,680
god Ryan it's so bad dating here is

1136
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,720
awful because it's expensive it's not

1137
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,230
just that people are people are weird

1138
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,410
there's

1139
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:59,430
super flakes because everybody here not

1140
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,780
even just that like people are really

1141
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,310
commitment-phobic like all the people

1142
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,540
I'd date for three months about okay

1143
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:09,300
it's time for us to be in a relationship

1144
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:12,330
now and they're like no no no it's yeah

1145
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:14,070
a super I don't even think it's just

1146
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:17,490
like in LA think it's very la focused

1147
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:19,500
but it's it's coastal yeah no way like

1148
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,210
the west coast is kind of like that was

1149
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,520
just like hey I'm just trying to live my

1150
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,900
best yeah con New York is right that's

1151
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,330
what they're never like hookup culture

1152
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,380
yeah they're always like it's like when

1153
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,670
you're at a party and you're talking to

1154
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,960
someone and they keep looking over your

1155
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,820
shoulder to see who else is in the room

1156
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,340
that's what dating here feels like I

1157
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,650
haven't had that happen I probably was

1158
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:46,320
the person but didn't notice yeah I

1159
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:48,810
think I did I think I think everyone's

1160
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,109
trying to like look for the next best

1161
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:52,410
thing

1162
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:53,970
yeah in dating and in work and in

1163
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:56,160
everything right in LA because

1164
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:58,560
everyone's yeah it's like a transplant

1165
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,700
City and everyone's trying to make it or

1166
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,619
you know they don't have a strong

1167
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,869
foundation here yeah and everyone I

1168
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:05,700
think settles down a lot later on the

1169
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:07,770
coast whereas like women we're still

1170
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,650
bound by our biological clock if we want

1171
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:12,030
to have children and you know the what

1172
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,780
do you call it way the physical way

1173
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:17,310
versus like adopting out and so I mean I

1174
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,720
think women are just ready to settle

1175
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,830
down a lot sooner than all the men here

1176
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,340
you do you want to have kids

1177
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:27,869
I do really bad does that mean a girl is

1178
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:30,540
out woman I would I would adopt or like

1179
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:31,950
do artificial insemination but I have

1180
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:35,940
always seen myself ending up with a man

1181
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:37,680
because I am more man skewed yeah so you

1182
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,020
mentioned that you have a video that's

1183
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,700
that's speaking on what was the title

1184
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,950
again I dated girls and now I understand

1185
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,510
men what are some of the like couples

1186
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:48,210
like a few things that yeah well they

1187
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:50,930
were like the makeup thing the make-out

1188
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:52,790
thing I mean and then

1189
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,790
this one girl kept joking about us

1190
00:43:52,790 --> 00:44:02,859
getting married like on our first date

1191
00:43:54,790 --> 00:44:06,859
and I got really like I don't know you

1192
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:08,510
for two hours and I've been guilty of

1193
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:10,160
making those kind of jokes on dates it's

1194
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,640
just like a fun flippin thing to do and

1195
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,319
then I was like oh my god but it's not

1196
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,900
on the first date right I mean I've made

1197
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:19,369
jokes if it's obviously a joke I don't

1198
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,390
see anything wrong with that right but I

1199
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:22,220
could see how that could freak someone

1200
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,109
else yeah what is it

1201
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,839
what does a fun day look like for you I

1202
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:29,510
love activities so like an escape room

1203
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:32,210
bullying laser tag like I love going and

1204
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:34,160
doing a thing but see so that's

1205
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,470
something that I've kind of adapted as

1206
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,400
is dating yes a lot of times guys would

1207
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,869
be like oh do you want to get dinner

1208
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,530
yeah then it feels like an interview

1209
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:41,510
yeah

1210
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:43,940
and so when you do an activity together

1211
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:46,220
not only are you guys working together

1212
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,079
to do stuff you're creating physicality

1213
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:57,859
and you're allowing for like playful

1214
00:44:48,079 --> 00:45:00,170
touching and stuff and then mid Grobe

1215
00:44:57,859 --> 00:45:04,040
and it was giggling playful touching

1216
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:06,349
sounds a lot nicer so after the playful

1217
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,060
touching you guys can have dinner and

1218
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:09,349
then like talk like oh it was really fun

1219
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,690
and then you have something to talk

1220
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:12,980
about yeah yeah yeah I also think you

1221
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:14,599
learn a lot about people and doing

1222
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,859
activities for them like versus just

1223
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:17,660
sitting down and talking to someone at

1224
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:19,930
dinner as Commun that boring cuz actions

1225
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:24,319
speak louder than words yes this is true

1226
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:27,740
touching that's my mouth David you ready

1227
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:29,839
for some playful touching David was the

1228
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:31,130
last time you asked labeled touch we

1229
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,589
turned in Julia Dean just good advice

1230
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:35,180
now we know don't make jokes about

1231
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:36,800
getting married on the first date

1232
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,030
actually you know what if both of you

1233
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,470
are making those jokes is that okay

1234
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,170
I think if both of you are on the same

1235
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:44,030
page yes but I wanna feel like people do

1236
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,800
people like do you go on dates like you

1237
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:47,270
just met them because I feel like if

1238
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,099
they didn't know your comedy because you

1239
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:51,109
are not the I don't think you're

1240
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:54,170
considered the average girl in terms of

1241
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:55,520
your comedy right is there some kind of

1242
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,950
disclaimer because if you were make

1243
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,140
those jokes you have that not like

1244
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:02,789
deadpan I'm not making a joke face right

1245
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:06,539
I don't know you do

1246
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:10,079
sometimes no I do yeah it's funny yeah

1247
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:11,249
dry humor yeah but like I can see

1248
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,660
somebody fat we just met I was like I'm

1249
00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:14,789
not sure if she's being serious or not

1250
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:18,719
uh I try to make it obvious that I'm

1251
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:20,459
joking I try if they watched you they

1252
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,349
would know yeah I try to get people

1253
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:24,179
though that don't watch me or know me

1254
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:25,890
yeah I feel like we have a preconceived

1255
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:27,150
idea I try not to Google anybody before

1256
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,529
I go on a date with them other than just

1257
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,419
see if there's like a crazy headline

1258
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:33,630
about them being like I don't know

1259
00:46:30,419 --> 00:46:37,199
problematic yeah if they have a hashtag

1260
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:40,380
yeah and then when I like them is when

1261
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:42,209
you deep dive what's the best thing

1262
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,069
about dating a guy and what's the best

1263
00:46:42,209 --> 00:46:45,839
thing about dating a girl I think the

1264
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:47,369
best thing about doing a dating girls so

1265
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,289
far has been the conversation like if

1266
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:50,249
there's anything that comes up like I

1267
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:51,660
feel very safe to have a conversation

1268
00:46:50,249 --> 00:46:52,679
about it like hey you said this thing

1269
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,849
and it made me feel a little bit like

1270
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:55,799
this but like I know you're in touch it

1271
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:58,799
wasn't this way but it can get to be

1272
00:46:55,799 --> 00:47:01,769
over communicating I think the best

1273
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:03,900
thing about dating guys it really

1274
00:47:01,769 --> 00:47:05,249
depends on the guy but for the most part

1275
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,719
I like feeling taken care of like

1276
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:10,559
emotionally and I feel like a lot of

1277
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:12,479
guys are very nurturing in that way yeah

1278
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,279
like they're down to like I like hanging

1279
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:15,989
out someone and they take initiative so

1280
00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:17,699
he's like oh I'll call the uber all

1281
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:18,779
schedules a date or I'll do this like

1282
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:20,009
I'll take you on a thing which I don't

1283
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:22,049
have to like mentally worry about

1284
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:24,390
whereas when I'm with a girl I'm usually

1285
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:26,579
the one planning and like taking action

1286
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:29,069
so generally speaking would you say that

1287
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:31,949
females it's it's uh it's more of a

1288
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:35,969
commute it's great communication on an

1289
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:38,519
emotional level and then guys generally

1290
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:41,279
tend to take care of people better or

1291
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:44,069
take care of women just take care of

1292
00:47:41,279 --> 00:47:45,719
women or men yeah in general yeah on a

1293
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:47,189
date I feel like men are very good at

1294
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:49,140
taking care of you if if they're the

1295
00:47:47,189 --> 00:47:50,339
kind of personality that can't it's hard

1296
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,559
to generalize because everyone's so

1297
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:53,999
different but yeah I do find with women

1298
00:47:52,559 --> 00:48:01,319
the communication is a lot more clear

1299
00:47:53,999 --> 00:48:05,099
mm-hmm interesting I think most guys

1300
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:06,599
aren't though encouraged to be a trainee

1301
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,219
they said on average a woman speaks

1302
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,089
sixteen thousand words a day and a guy

1303
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:14,069
speaks ten thousand really yeah yeah I

1304
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:17,750
uh yeah I guess I could I could see that

1305
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:25,170
yeah I think I speak probably of

1306
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:26,640
three thousand well is that all we have

1307
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:28,650
for our questions and we got away from

1308
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,360
that for a little bit yeah yeah I think

1309
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,420
that's would you would you consider

1310
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,870
yourself to be a successful person

1311
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:39,750
that's from that's from Twitter actually

1312
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:42,780
hmm I know from the outside yes inside

1313
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:46,080
no really why it's quite now I don't

1314
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:47,340
know I just feel I guess because there's

1315
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,870
different levels you can have success

1316
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,420
right like yeah I have a personal

1317
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:53,130
success career success so do you just

1318
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,200
overall see everything is unsuccessful

1319
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:57,210
or do you see it as unsuccessful I just

1320
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,250
see it as like a process and I still

1321
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:01,710
very I feel like I'm still in the

1322
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:02,910
process versus if I look out objectively

1323
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,110
and I see what other people see I'm like

1324
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:06,660
oh yeah I guess I would consider that

1325
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:09,900
successful compared to most but inside I

1326
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:11,460
don't feel like I am successful is that

1327
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,680
because you think once you feel that way

1328
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,990
you'll stop wanting to pursue all these

1329
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,880
different things or pushing yourself to

1330
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,980
do it I don't know I just feel like I'm

1331
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,200
still me if that makes any sense like do

1332
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,260
you consider yourself successful I think

1333
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,210
I would if I'm thinking of what I wanted

1334
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,610
when I was younger but then when I got

1335
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:31,440
here I don't yeah yeah yeah it's the

1336
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:33,810
same thing yeah there's like levels to

1337
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,700
it right yeah it's like I unlock this

1338
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:37,890
achievement and now it's to the next

1339
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,810
stage yeah yeah it's so incremental and

1340
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:42,840
small to that it doesn't ever feel like

1341
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:45,150
oh I have reached my peak you know yeah

1342
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,920
I mean when I was like a kid my idea of

1343
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,670
success was just like making X amount of

1344
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,780
money yeah

1345
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:51,860
like that was just like okay this is

1346
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:55,050
what I gonna get this job do this and

1347
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:57,780
once I did it made that amount that I

1348
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:59,910
was trying to get to I realized okay

1349
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,350
this is not success yeah and maybe it

1350
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,790
might be because I got there maybe if I

1351
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:05,310
never reached it then it would have been

1352
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,870
like I'm always chasing something yeah I

1353
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,970
think there's it I think if you once you

1354
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,160
consider yourself successful it's hard

1355
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:13,650
to say is everyone's definition but I

1356
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,330
think then you kind of just do nothing

1357
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:17,040
well isn't success also I feel like

1358
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,600
success is always changing like your

1359
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,570
idea that is changing as you're doing

1360
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,820
more things and so it's always away it's

1361
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:25,470
always farther than you if that makes

1362
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,850
sense like I always was like my

1363
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,470
definition of success is when there's

1364
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,819
two projects I really want to do and I

1365
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,949
have the offers on both and I

1366
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:33,239
to choose between them and then I got

1367
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:34,829
there and I was like okay now my

1368
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,359
definition of success is being the lead

1369
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:37,680
of a movie and I got there I'm like okay

1370
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:39,479
well now my definition of success is

1371
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,519
being a Marvel superhero in a movie or

1372
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:44,089
like and so it just keeps like going

1373
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:46,109
farther away you're in a Marvel movie

1374
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:49,859
well I wasn't a superhero I was a

1375
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:54,809
journalist but you were in tomorrow you

1376
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:57,329
know what you be still pretty crazy or

1377
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:59,670
you come across like a magic pen and

1378
00:50:57,329 --> 00:51:07,410
it's like I mean I think that is a

1379
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:09,180
character all right I mean you still

1380
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:11,219
have the goal of becoming the first

1381
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,969
female president no I don't want to be

1382
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:13,680
in politics

1383
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:15,569
it hasn't been taking it you're pretty

1384
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,630
aren't you pretty opinionated on that I

1385
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:20,249
am but I I'm not educated enough in

1386
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:21,839
politics I don't understand how the

1387
00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:22,979
system works intricately I have friends

1388
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,989
that are way more qualified than I am

1389
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:26,819
and I just was like I can't I feel I

1390
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:29,910
feel the same way yeah but even about

1391
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:31,529
like opinions I'm swayed easily really

1392
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:34,499
not really it's not swayed it's more

1393
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:36,180
just like I'm very open to hearing every

1394
00:51:34,499 --> 00:51:37,890
side I think that's a good quality to

1395
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,569
have them but is also I've been told

1396
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:42,479
it's bad because it's like oh you're

1397
00:51:39,569 --> 00:51:43,769
just sympathizer eccentric and I'm like

1398
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:46,219
well I just want to hear both sides

1399
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:48,869
there's a reason why both sides are so

1400
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:50,729
like a hundred percent they're right you

1401
00:51:48,869 --> 00:51:52,079
know mm-hmm so I just like to see both

1402
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:53,969
sides because I'm not smart enough to

1403
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,769
know like I find it interesting right

1404
00:51:53,969 --> 00:51:56,549
there's only two sides I mean there are

1405
00:51:55,769 --> 00:51:59,699
many sides

1406
00:51:56,549 --> 00:52:02,789
yeah but technically speaking but I it's

1407
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:05,670
like why is it just blue and red can't

1408
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:07,049
there be like purple and brown and I

1409
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:09,959
mean there are they're just too strong

1410
00:52:07,049 --> 00:52:11,219
yeah yeah it's like well we got if you

1411
00:52:09,959 --> 00:52:14,489
can't no but you can't support that

1412
00:52:11,219 --> 00:52:16,199
because then they'll say you're actually

1413
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:17,910
helping the other side because it's

1414
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,459
never gonna win yeah bro it's never

1415
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:22,890
gonna win him I don't know I think I

1416
00:52:20,459 --> 00:52:26,729
think these little parties should get

1417
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:28,469
some love too I agree like yeah they

1418
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:31,140
don't have a shot but they should they

1419
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:37,820
don't have a shot at all but let's give

1420
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:41,840
him a shot I'm starting my own party

1421
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:44,120
I'll support you okay well I mean that's

1422
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:47,780
pretty much it yeah is there anything

1423
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:49,820
you want to I have a question okay yeah

1424
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,860
it's more about the standard thing

1425
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:55,150
because you're not in the beginning and

1426
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:58,330
I was so when you're is there like

1427
00:52:55,150 --> 00:53:03,140
because you know you're strong feminist

1428
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:05,780
and when it comes to comedy though are

1429
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:09,050
there things that you feel shouldn't be

1430
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:11,270
joked about I think every topic is up

1431
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:13,490
for grabs if you can a make it funny and

1432
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:16,160
your be not perpetuating some kind of

1433
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:18,590
hate speech or violence or any kind like

1434
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,620
I think as problematic as he is louis

1435
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:23,720
c.k made a really good paedophile joke

1436
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:26,570
where he talked about like you know it

1437
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,560
must be so good for a pedophile to do

1438
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,540
this because of the repercussions

1439
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,010
involved in or like he was the first

1440
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,270
person who was like oh I had a baby and

1441
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:34,040
now I understand why there are dumpster

1442
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:36,530
babies so he was really good at taking

1443
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:38,150
previously taboo topics and putting them

1444
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,800
in such a specific lens that they were

1445
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,660
okay to laugh at and they weren't

1446
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,240
necessarily condoning the behavior of

1447
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,830
people it was just putting it in a very

1448
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,240
unique light that you were looked at and

1449
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:50,480
you thought yeah okay I understand

1450
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,920
that's funny so I think like any topic

1451
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,510
is up for grabs as long as you can find

1452
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,650
one of that unique light is but I think

1453
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:56,570
the hard thing with comedy is were

1454
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:58,820
incredibly politically correct now and I

1455
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:01,160
think that has a lot of pros to it but

1456
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:04,010
it takes a long time to craft a

1457
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,380
masterpiece [ __ ] joke and you have to

1458
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:07,820
try it out over and over on audiences

1459
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,550
and now when people record you in that

1460
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,550
process trying to find that lens you can

1461
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:15,010
be viewed as incredibly problematic

1462
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:19,760
cancelled yeah cancelled immediately

1463
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:23,110
because when Louis came back you heard

1464
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:27,290
about how they set was yeah so I guess

1465
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:29,300
who is exempt from you know having to

1466
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:31,670
always be politically correct because a

1467
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,050
comedians job is to find like oh this is

1468
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:34,760
a line that we shouldn't be crossing

1469
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,990
were supposed to push boundaries well I

1470
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,230
think the Louie things different because

1471
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:41,060
he he had a problematic you know me to

1472
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:42,890
movement and everyone was mad that he

1473
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,720
came back and he didn't talk about it if

1474
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:46,190
he had made his entire set about that

1475
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,550
behavior and made himself the butt of

1476
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,350
the joke

1477
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,700
and really showcase some learning along

1478
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,150
the way from that experience I think he

1479
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,740
would have been embraced

1480
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:54,510
that's what we really wanted right we

1481
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,700
wanted him to learn from it to grow and

1482
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,840
to apologize and instead he's just made

1483
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,760
a bunch of jokes that were completely

1484
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,070
irrelevant so it was like a an elephant

1485
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:05,160
in the room I don't think anyone is

1486
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:06,900
exempt necessarily but I think if you're

1487
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,150
in comedy you have to be hyper aware

1488
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,890
that anything years you say on stage can

1489
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,210
be taken at face value because people

1490
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,410
are not comedians they don't know that

1491
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:15,270
you you know you're going onstage a

1492
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:18,080
hundred times to figure out this one bit

1493
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:20,460
and get it perfectly right that's true

1494
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,170
yeah but I mean like even just being on

1495
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,720
stage you I feel like that gives you a

1496
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:26,100
certain like freedom like even just like

1497
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,230
if you were to say something on Twitter

1498
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,120
the same thing if you were tweeted that

1499
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,440
same thing can come to haunt you but if

1500
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,060
you sit on a stage with a mic and it

1501
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,620
looks like a stand-up set you can get

1502
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,720
away with a lot more yeah definitely

1503
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:39,990
that's a whole Kevin Hart thing you know

1504
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:42,150
he had some tweet what he'd say that he

1505
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:44,370
got the most recent no it's like the

1506
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:46,620
whole like calling his friends like gay

1507
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:48,600
or the f-word yeah something like that

1508
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:50,430
and then like I feel like if someone

1509
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,110
said on stage it's like a different lens

1510
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,670
like it's like that's okay

1511
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:55,290
well there's also no tone on line so you

1512
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:58,080
can't really understand that something

1513
00:55:55,290 --> 00:56:03,510
as a joke she was like it was like ten

1514
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:04,650
years ago and like yeah dad I think is

1515
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:06,000
an important thing to look at because

1516
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,530
people dig up all these old tweets I'm

1517
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,420
like it was okay to say that back then

1518
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,700
it was okay to say [ __ ] back then

1519
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,470
like you have to look at it the cultural

1520
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,330
lens like I watched bring it on at the

1521
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,880
Hollywood cemetery recently now movies

1522
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:19,590
so homophobic it's good but it's like

1523
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,240
every time they called someone like a

1524
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:22,830
dyke or a [ __ ] like the whole audience

1525
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,480
was like boom and it was like

1526
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:26,640
understandably so that's not okay

1527
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,260
anymore but at the time it was totally

1528
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,210
accepted different language almost yeah

1529
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,010
I mean I have a video that's still up

1530
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:33,840
that has the word [ __ ] in it mm-hmm

1531
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:35,850
and like I don't want to take it down

1532
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,380
because at the time like I said it

1533
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,150
wasn't nobody complained about it yeah

1534
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,830
if they and I called it out so I know

1535
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:42,960
obviously said like this is a different

1536
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,730
time and yeah but I'm not gonna take it

1537
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,500
down because of what it was mean and

1538
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,820
it's clear that it was a different time

1539
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:51,000
and I've I said I'm not gonna use that

1540
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:52,350
now yeah right but yeah it was it's

1541
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,880
crazy that that's out there and like

1542
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,740
give people if I tried to hide it people

1543
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,360
would find it 100 make it a thing oh

1544
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,490
yeah people have pointed out like I used

1545
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,290
to do a podcast with an X where the

1546
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,790
whole point was shocking answers and so

1547
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,260
one of the questions like if he could

1548
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,060
get away with a crime what would it be

1549
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,310
and I was like I would

1550
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:09,260
rape a man so like that's so funny it's

1551
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:10,610
impossible or whatever and we all

1552
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,980
discussed to the questions and answers

1553
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:14,810
ahead of time but it is cut like blew up

1554
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:17,300
on reddit as me later down the road

1555
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:19,190
layered way later like five years later

1556
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,230
or something and I was like no this is a

1557
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:23,540
horrible cringy joke I was trying to be

1558
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:25,070
funny also like that's the way you cope

1559
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,630
with assault when you've been assaulted

1560
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:29,960
you try to make light of it or you use

1561
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:31,910
that kind of language and culture cancel

1562
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,090
