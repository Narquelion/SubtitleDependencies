00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
hey guys today's video is going to be

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,589
about all those inspirational sayings

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,970
and inspirational quotes that we've all

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,049
come to know and love and I'm not

5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,790
talking about all of them I'm just

6
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,740
talking about the really overdone ones

7
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,269
or the ones that are just kinda stupid

8
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,500
and just to be clear I have no problem

9
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,820
with people who will try to inspire

10
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,289
others I think that's great that's one

11
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,330
of the many reasons why I still do

12
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,859
YouTube I'm all for deeper meanings like

13
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,090
I love when things actually make you

14
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,470
have to think then there's the ones that

15
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,939
are just trying way too hard to be

16
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,460
inspirational it's those quotes that are

17
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,990
just so cheesy and just not real and

18
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,849
they're constantly posting about them

19
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,529
whether it's to remind themselves or to

20
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,730
try and inspire the rest of us we've all

21
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,200
seen the polls you know you're scrolling

22
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,790
down your Instagram feed it's not only

23
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,719
some girl pulls this picture with a

24
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,820
caption of nice-looking pet I did I just

25
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,920
caught myself sorry young girls and guys

26
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,450
I got to be a little PC here I know guys

27
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,680
that post those things as well you know

28
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,230
I'm just trying to be real here usually

29
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,610
more girls that I've seen personally

30
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,039
that I don't presume say that either

31
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,180
there's a 50/50 exactly equal amount of

32
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,320
guys and girls that post these things

33
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,370
all right it's not the point I don't

34
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,739
know why I'm making that point the point

35
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,059
is I am a horrible person okay and I

36
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,559
have a horrible mind it doesn't let me

37
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,359
get inspired by these things when I know

38
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,920
how hard someone is trying to make an

39
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,990
inspirational pole or trying to be

40
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,060
serious and inspiring I can't help but

41
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:14,090
be realistic and make them a little less

42
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:17,400
serious sorry in advance if every day

43
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,869
meaning of life is to give life a

44
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,460
meaning if the meaning of life is to

45
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,930
give life a meaning you kind of just did

46
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,490
that for us now didn't you you already

47
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,020
gave life a meaning so I guess life is

48
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,900
meaningless because you already defined

49
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,340
it you miss 100% of the shots and you

50
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,960
don't take how is this one even

51
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,340
inspirational you can't make a shot if

52
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,430
you don't take it as extending the

53
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,409
obvious think about that did you ask her

54
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,549
out nah man I chickened out you know you

55
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,009
missed a hundred percent of the shots

56
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,360
you don't take no I didn't miss the shot

57
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,430
I just didn't take it no what it means

58
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,200
is you can't make the shot if you don't

59
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,369
take the shot well that's like pointing

60
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,259
out the obvious that's like saying if

61
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,509
you don't take the bus you can't take

62
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,340
the bus or how you would put it you miss

63
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,290
a hundred percent of the buses you don't

64
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,689
take wow that is G it's like mind

65
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,689
blowing so whether you think you can or

66
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,810
you think you can

67
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:08,160
you're right I think I can fly and I

68
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,330
think I can't die unless you're right

69
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,549
which is not the number of breaths we

70
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:20,709
take the number of moments that take our

71
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:23,110
breath away okay I get today's a gift

72
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,910
that's why we call it the present so

73
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,620
we're just making puns now well in that

74
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,360
case tomorrow is going to be a chore

75
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,250
that's why they call it the future

76
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,569
yesterday was so awful you wish you

77
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,489
could have just skipped it that's why

78
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,200
they call it the past next seven days

79
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:37,360
are just going to suck all the energy

80
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,000
out of you that's why they call it a

81
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,519
week you cannot save people you can only

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,319
love them well I guess but don't tell

83
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,319
that to a firefighter or a lifeguard

84
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:55,780
love you shoot for the moon even if you

85
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,579
miss you'll land among the stars this

86
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,989

87
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,459

89
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,019

91
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,590

93
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,889

94
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,989

encouraging people to see the rain

109
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,640

110
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,989

111
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,579

growing up all the time is just so

165
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,039
irresponsible the reason why people take

166
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,659
care of themselves and they behave and

167
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,409
they fall in love is is for their future

just ruined your life dinner it's fine

183
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:09,619
because yes here was my last day and so

184
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:11,029
as today you know I'm just going to a

185
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,669
drop of soap I don't even care of scared

186
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:15,409
I love what you do do what you love how

187
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,389
profound Oh a brilliant

188
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,309
it's literally saying the same thing

189
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:22,009
twice the only way that this quote is

190
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:23,809
remotely useful isn't that the transit

191
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,479
property you can also say eat what makes

192
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:28,969
you full be full from what you eat enjoy

193
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,269
where you live live where you enjoy

194
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:34,279
living one plus two equals three three

195
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:36,739
equals two plus one

196
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,659
hashtag transitive property always look

197
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:40,279
on the bright side this one's not that

198
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,479
stupid it's just they shouldn't have put

199
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,919
the word always in they can't always

200
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,199
look on the bright side I mean you can

201
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,999
but that's delusion something it's fun

202
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,889
on my girls pregnant why are we gonna do

203
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:50,479
like it's gonna ruin us hey come on

204
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,429
don't think like that I mean I love her

205
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,929
and I think she's the one but I still

206
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:56,269
think we're ready to be parents yet hey

207
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:57,529
look on the bright side you're right do

208
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:59,990
the get you don't even know if it's

209
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:01,849
yours yet I think she did kiss a lot of

210
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,490
frogs before you you know looks money

211
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:06,019
doesn't buy happiness last but not least

212
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,639
this one is actually one of my favorite

213
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:08,749
and the perfect example to use because

214
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,249
it's the one that everybody usually

215
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:12,050
agrees with everybody grew up with this

216
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:12,979
this quote being told to them we know

217
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,689
one way or another whether it's

218
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,849
literally a teacher or parents saying

219
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:19,279
that to you or an inspirational video or

220
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:21,169
you saw the lesson on some Disney show

221
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,999
or the show's horns everybody else money

222
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:25,399
is the root of all evil and although

223
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:27,289
again I agree with this one to a certain

224
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,729
degree I know it sounds bad but does it

225
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,429
make you that bad of a person to be

226
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:33,139
realistic for a change what's wrong just

227
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:34,999
found out my prom is dead what what you

228
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,709
saw yesterday she passed away last night

229
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:38,329
no she's still alive but she's in the

230
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:40,309
hospital right now she requires a very

231
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:41,869
very expensive surgery and I can't

232
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:43,189
afford it can barely afford rent let

233
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:44,329
alone the food on the table you know

234
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:45,409
what have you took out a loan or

235
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:47,089
something we're already paying off a

236
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:49,219
bunch of loans i guy I don't know what

237
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:49,930
to do all my life is over her life is

238
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,970
over

239
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,220
maybe not what you're not gonna believe

240
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,990
this but I magically found this at the

241
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,000
end of a rainbow and it's filled with

242
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,620
one and I really feel like you needed a

243
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,510
lot more than me there

244
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,100
are you serious take it I'm sure it's

245
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,229
enough to like pay for the surgery food

246
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,639
for a year rent your loans whatever

247
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,590
you're serious you're going to give this

248
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,340
yeah like whatever will make you happy

249
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,440
man Wow

250
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,460
I don't know what to say other than what

251
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,050
the hell is your problem

252
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,370
what how is this supposed to make me

253
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,410
happier okay money does not buy

254
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,300
happiness no that's supposed to be for

255
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,680
your grandma's build it just told you

256
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,120
how horrible my life is right now and

257
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,510
you're going to go bring me this the

258
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,070
root of all evil No yeah like I said I'm

259
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,650
a horrible person couldn't get that by

260
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,970
now anyway obviously I exaggerated these

261
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,320
examples a little bit you know for the

262
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,270
video my point remains the same

263
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,560
hopefully you picked up on it's great to

264
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,630
be inspired every once in a while we all

265
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,789
need that you can't live by these cheesy

266
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,560
quotes that sound perfect or expect to

267
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,909
follow them all the time and maybe I

268
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,620
could be wrong maybe there are people

269
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,660
that actually do live by them all the

270
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,650
time but I personally think that if you

271
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,910
really think you're living your life

272
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,860
perfectly you're lying to yourself

273
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,660
because as nice as these things might

274
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,100
sound nobody can live perfectly and

275
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,630
everybody goes through highs and low you

276
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,950
just have to be realistic it's fine if

277
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,630
you don't live every single day like

278
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,430
it's your last or to the fullest because

279
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,110
you're not wasting your time sometimes

280
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,400
people like to chill my last day would

281
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,779
still be probably staying at home

282
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,850
watching Netflix and it might be a waste

283
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,290
of time but I enjoy it and no money does

284
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,640
not buy true happiness but must be

285
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,900
realistic here and I'll use this one as

286
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,100
the example cuz it's the last one that

287
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,870
you seen and it's you know that you just

288
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,520
understand I actually find the realistic

289
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,350
quotes you know in response the cheesy

290
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,700
ones to be more inspiring there's that

291
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,290
realistic name that says you know money

292
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,390
does not buy happiness but I'd rather be

293
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,950
crying in a Ferrari with a million

294
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,360
dollar home rather than living on the

295
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,160
street yeah it doesn't sound nice or

296
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,839
inspirational but at least it's true and

297
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,400
to be honest that actually inspired me

298
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,990
more because it makes me appreciate what

299
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
I'm fortunate enough to have if you

300
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,050
actually have money and you live by the

301
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,670
others saying money does not buy

302
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,320
happiness you're taking for granted what

303
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,550
you're fortunate enough to have like

304
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,810
something that would actually bring a

305
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,279
lot of happiness to other people who

306
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,930
really need it right now and I know this

307
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,279
all might sound horrible and the

308
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,660
opposite of what you want to say is

309
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,880
trying to inspire someone but you know

310
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm not trying to sound like a douche or

311
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,240
a dick I'm just being realistic I'm

312
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,350
being real this dick sorry I really I'm

313
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,029
starting to sound a dick but you know

314
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,190
what no I think I'm just being honest in

315
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,750
fact I am going to be the inspiring one

316
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,860
right now but in the honest way I've

317
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,510
been thinking for a while on that in

318
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,340
order to be truly happy you do have to

319
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,810
be a Zig

320
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,770
got upset other people's I know from

321
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,030
personal experience that if you're

322
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,440
always trying to please others that

323
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,040
defeats the whole purpose of life this

324
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,630
is your life

325
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,220
so not just okay to be a dick and be a

326
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,790
little selfish in fact some of the

327
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,140
happiest people or dick repotting

328
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,910
there's literally the best cake I've

329
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,260
ever had seriously that was awesome

330
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,700
there's one last slice left slope and

331
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,200
you guys go ahead no no no I already had

332
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,910
a place where should a minute to the

333
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,410
birthday I mean I had the biggest slice

334
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:32,050
I could impossible ticket we all move up

335
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:36,040
this wears off good we've got four

336
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,330
flights you get the point to see

337
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,890
sometimes you got to be a dick that

338
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,530
could be the start of my realistic

339
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,850
inspirational quote line thing right

340
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,230
next to the money can buy you happiness

341
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,570
mean in fact those two can go together

342
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,250
money can't buy you happiness money is

343
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,350
happiness because if you have money

344
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,760
money makes you rich and rich a sharp

345
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,290
for Richard and as we all know the

346
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,610
nickname for Richard is dick proving

347
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,500
that in order to have happiness

348
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,540
sometimes you got to be a dick and piss

349
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,140
people off because like I always quote

350
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:05,530
starting today they can't have happiness

351
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:07,180
without the penis hey okay okay I know I

352
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,740
already have to add this party into all

353
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,990
the people that I might have offended by

354
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,550
saying the word dick or penis too much

355
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,110
at the end there and also now let me

356
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:19,470
just go ahead and make things right and

357
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,470
just say vagina yeah gender equality
