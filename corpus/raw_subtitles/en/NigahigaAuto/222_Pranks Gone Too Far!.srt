2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,680
beard and the hair i'm growing it out

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,040
really hates it see he's mad hey guys so

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,559
i'm gonna be talking about one of the

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
biggest trends that exist today

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,360
prank videos and i'm sure you guys

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,960
already know but right now prank videos

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,480
are like the most watched videos that

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,560
are online and i mean i get why

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,000
i personally always love pranks pranks

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,000
are always gonna be a big thing but

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,039
lately i feel like there's just so many

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,880
prank videos out there

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,720
we've seen all the best pranks it's

15
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,160
really hard to come up with a new

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,199
funnier prank because there's so many

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,000
funny pranks out there and because

18
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,840
there's such an over

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
saturation of these pranks prankers are

20
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,800
being forced to step their game up

21
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,320
they're all trying to top each other and

22
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,920
of course not all of them but i feel

23
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,440
like a lot of these prankers are just

24
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,640
going way too far to the point where

25
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,239
they're not even pranks anymore they're

26
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
just straight-up crimes some prankers

27
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,000
are like going on the streets and

28
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,440
they're like calling

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,120
out random guys to fight or like

30
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,640
grabbing random girls butts

31
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,559
i've even seen a video of some guys

32
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,520
throwing fake bombs at people because i

33
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,280
guess terrorism and

34
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
murder is so hilarious like that's not

35
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
even funny that's just like shocking the

36
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,039
only way that these so-called pranks are

37
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,399
not crimes or if they're staged or fake

38
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,000
but that's like a whole other story

39
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,359
we'll talk about that later anyway it is

40
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,559
getting ridiculous and not in the good

41
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,880
way pranks used to be good

42
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,760
innocent fun nobody got hurt or sexually

43
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
assaulted or

44
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,560
bombed thrown at them and i don't know

45
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,159
maybe i was just brought up differently

46
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,439
but you just don't prank people that you

47
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,400
don't know you prank your friends

48
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,240
whatever happened to the good

49
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,520
old-fashioned clean harmless prank

50
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,799
like when we were young we used to spray

51
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
like pam on the floor so that when

52
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,600
somebody would walk on it it'd be like

53
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,960
slippery or like the pat someone on the

54
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,159
back prank where you're really actually

55
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,520
putting a sign on them that says

56
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,880
something that would probably be

57
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,080
considered offensive today or like when

58
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,439
one of your friends leave their phone to

59
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,119
go to the bathroom so you and your

60
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,479
friends grab it and hide it and then

61
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,680
basically watch them freak out a little

62
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,119
bit and then give it back or like what

63
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,799
even happened to the most innocent

64
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:42,399
harmless prank of all the prank call

65
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,119

saying pranks used to be innocent but

87
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
because there's so many good pranks out

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,480
there that now you just have to do

89
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,840
something completely crazy to stand out

90
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,519
those innocent pranks you just saw

91
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,879
that's what pranks look like five to ten

92
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,080
years ago but those pranks would never

93
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,760
get viewed today because they're not

94
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280

and a lemon so that when they slip and

99
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,680
fall they get cut by the glass shards

100
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,360
and the lemon just goes inside of their

101
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,160
cuts

102
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800

152
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,400
experiment

154
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,520
like before people get all defensive of

155
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,120
their favorite prankers i'm not talking

156
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
about all prankers i got a lot of close

157
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,759
friends that make prank videos and

158
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
they're still successful without having

159
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,160
to commit crimes in their pranks i'm

160
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,680
just talking about the ones that will do

161
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
whatever it takes to top their last

162
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
prank and i'm not gonna name names they

163
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,080
know who they are we all do they're

164
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,840
willing to either break the law or

165
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,440
stage their pranks in order to get views

166
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,280
and yes i said it earlier prankers fake

167
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,960
pranks all the time big surprise this is

168
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,160
not news i actually have no problem with

169
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,600
stage pranks if they're still

170
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,199
entertaining what i do have a problem

171
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,919
with is when they lie and say that it's

172
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,600
real when it's

173
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,800
obviously not real just own up to it

174
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,919
it's entertainment there's nothing wrong

175
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,360
with that and if you're gonna fake a

176
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,800
prank and pretend that it's real at

177
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560
least put in the effort to make it look

178
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,320
real it blows my mind how many of these

179
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,440
videos i've seen that are so obviously

180
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,880
fake and people in the comments don't

181
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
seem to catch on i mean it's pretty

182
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
obvious when pranks are fake you just

183
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,319
have to use common sense here's some

184
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
really quick tips to tell

185
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,440
if a prank is fake or not for example if

186
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,960
somebody's committing a crime in a prank

187
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,400
by grabbing random girls butts on the

188
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,840
street and they put it on social media

189
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,280
for millions of people to see i'm sorry

190
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,720
to spoil it but there's a very great

191
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,000
chance that that prank is staged because

192
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
if not that person would be in jail

193
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,039
that's video evidence of sexual assault

194
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,560
that millions of people witnessed

195
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
another obvious sign of a fake prank

196
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
the camera is far away but you can hear

197
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
the pranker and the victim talking

198
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,120
clearly chances are they're both mic'ed

199
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,479
up or even the camera angles there's

200
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,600
certain shots and some pranks where

201
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,039
there's absolutely no way that the

202
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,560
cameraman could get that shot without

203
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,240
the victim noticing them so it's either

204
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,280
staged or they filmed that part after

205
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,039
the price so basically

206
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,319
it could be real but they shot it twice

207
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,919
and probably the biggest giveaway is

208
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,360
blurring faces well not blurring faces

209
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,720
but getting permission from the victims

210
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,240
to use them in the video especially for

211
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,520
big prankers all the popular prankers

212
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,880
know that you have to get permission

213
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,919
from the people that you prank in order

214
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,280
to use them in a video because if you

215
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,560
don't that video is going to get removed

216
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,000
or you're probably going to get sued

217
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,360
just think about it for a second a lot

218
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,280
of times these victims they get

219
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,759
extremely mad or upset by the pranker

220
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
which is

221
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,800
perfectly normal they should be upset

222
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,400
but the truth is the fact that we can

223
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
see their face on video means that they

224
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,639
gave

225
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,840
consent to be on this video if somebody

226
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,319
just pranked you or

227
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,160
scared you or hurt you in in some way to

228
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,599
make you that mad why would you consent

229
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,960
letting the world look at you like an

230
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,280
idiot unless of course you were paid off

231
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
or

232
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,560
more realistically staged there's a lot

233
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
more little ways to tell a prank is fake

234
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,639
but i

235
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,560
i'm just i'm getting off topic anyway

236
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,080
fake or not pranks are going way too far

237
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,599
and it's becoming a dangerous culture

238
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,800
let's stop escalating these pranks

239
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,080
before it's too late and somebody

240
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,759
actually gets killed let's just go back

241
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,440
to the good old-fashioned harmless

242
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,520
innocent pranks like pam spray

243
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,120
or prank calls about your refrigerator

244
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,160
running you know the classics cause even

245
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,240
though they're pranks

246
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,840
in the end everybody's still happy

247
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
everybody still wins and most

248
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:45,840
importantly

249
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:59,840
nobody ever gets hurt

250
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:59,840
