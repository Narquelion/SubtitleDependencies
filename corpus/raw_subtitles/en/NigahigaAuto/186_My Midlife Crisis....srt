1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:06,299
did you always look like this

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,559
why does it still look so dark oh you

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,240
know what there we go well now there's a

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,950
glare that's annoying see now you guys

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,599
can see why there's rings in my eyes all

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,220
the time yeah I recently got glasses

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,230
again I know it's been like seven years

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,000
since I got LASIK apparently LASIK

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,609
doesn't last forever so these things are

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,070
back I mean not that I used it a lot in

11
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,529
videos and a lot see me with glasses

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,390
that is because I used to be very

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,890
insecure about how I look now I don't

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,000
really care because I'm home and also

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,530
it's a different time you know the

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,989
glasses for whatever reason in the past

17
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,340
decade have become a lot more cool and I

18
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,690
think it's because you know enemies are

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,950
more popular because you know Anatomy is

20
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,780
they always have that really cocky

21
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,610
arrogant dude who's like looking at the

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,079
ground laughing to himself as he pushes

23
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,520
up his glasses so that he can look at

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,300
you and say something really smart or

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:57,629
cool

26
00:00:49,300 --> 00:01:00,280
[Music]

27
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,769
and I still look pretty nerdy I don't

28
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,650
really like how I look low insecure

29
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:07,270
still hey guys hey guys hey guys see

30
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,100
obviously I haven't vlogged in a very

31
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,479
long time but you know I mean it's like

32
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,130
riding a bike you know once I start

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,869
doing it a little warming up it does all

34
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,549
comes flooding right back like I

35
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:18,250
remember Bieber fever

36
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:20,590
that was a thing less than three okay

37
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,090
yeah I kind of forgot how to start a

38
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,200
video naturally but I know this is not

39
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,940
it for real this time

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,830
hey guys so this is definitely the

41
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,360
longest break I've ever taken from not

42
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,220
posting videos on this channel in my

43
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,409
entire youtube career and I know I'm

44
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,240
always apologizing and making excuses to

45
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:36,369
you guys for why I'm not posting and

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,250
that does get annoying so this time for

47
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:41,409
I'm really not going I'm so sorry guys I

48
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,509
really just I've been going through a

49
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:45,429
lot of things over the past years one I

50
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:48,729
don't usually talk about relationship

51
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:52,659
stuff here on YouTube but just because I

52
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:55,600
made it public ironically last year I am

53
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,580
no longer dating anyone I'm not dating

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,020
mrs. Shay anymore I know some of you

55
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,430
have already figured it out because of

56
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,079
you know looking at our other social

57
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,329
medias but I never really said anything

58
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,329
here on YouTube and I felt like since I

59
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:08,590
did announce it publicly I should

60
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,299
probably let you guys know that as well

61
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,130
and don't worry it wasn't like a messy

62
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:14,230
breakup or anything like that it was a

63
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,180
very mutual I didn't I wasn't gonna make

64
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,170
a whole video about it I just thought I

65
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,760
should mention it to you guys because

66
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,350
it's been a while since I updated you on

67
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,510
anything and don't get me wrong that's

68
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,519
not the sole reason why I took this

69
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,260
break I mean it probably contributed to

70
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,000
it a little bit the real reason why I

71
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,829
had to take this break was because I

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,350
needed to reflect on my own life I mean

73
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:34,510
it is 2020 and the thing that I have

74
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,820
found was that I don't know how to break

75
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,650
this to you guys but I'm freakin old man

76
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,750
I mean I just realized that I am going

77
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,950
to be 30 freakin 30 and I know if this

78
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,260
doesn't make any sense but I never

79
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,070
thought I'd actually be 30 years old I

80
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:50,590
mean not at least until I was 50 that's

81
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,200
three decades oh two dogs could have

82
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,549
lived a full life and died in the same

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,500
amount of time that I've been around I'm

84
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,290
a two dog death hero and yet at the same

85
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,170
time how many times have I been caught a

86
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,500
good

87
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:06,920
I think about it kind of a lot I'm like

88
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,650
I mean well 29 Christmases in a row and

89
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:17,390
Counting nothing that's a big deal or

90
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:20,330
anything you stop stop taking my glasses

91
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,640
your glass is who the hell are you I'm

92
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,200
you but mature as a 30 year old that's

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,760
why I'm not insecure about wearing my

94
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,610
glasses and comparing myself to some

95
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,590
silly little anime cartoons oh okay I

96
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,970
guess I have a lot meaner in the future

97
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,410
I'm not trying to be mean

98
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,480
I just don't have a lot of time to get

99
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,010
you to where I'm at right now and why

100
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,510
exactly do you think I need your help

101
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,890
because I am a manifestation of

102
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,450
everything you thought you would be by

103
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,480
the time you're 30 oh really

104
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,070
yes married yep kids two of them YouTube

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,720
here and there but most of my time goes

106
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,490
into making actual movies and television

107
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,460
shows that is when I'm not enjoying my

108
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:54,410
beautiful toilet room toilet er what a

109
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,060
toilet aquarium it's a toilet surrounded

110
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,740
by a gigantic fish tank on all four

111
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,270
sides including the floor and the

112
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,610
ceiling so that it feels like you're in

113
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,770
a warm transparent box in the middle of

114
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,510
the ocean an ocean so big to the point

115
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,060
that it almost feels like you're in the

116
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:11,000
aquarium but for the fish I don't

117
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,410
remember wanting that by 30 but yes I

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,550
mean like how do you how do you even get

119
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,050
in there I think it doesn't matter

120
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,609
you're not gonna have any of those

121
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,049
things by the time you're 30 maybe not

122
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:20,299
ever at the rate that you're maturing

123
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,680
well I'm not gonna lie I think I was a

124
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,050
lot younger when I thought I would have

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,490
all of this by this age I literally

126
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,260
forgot about all those goals that's

127
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,090
exactly why I'm here to remind you of

128
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,890
everything that you ever wanted in life

129
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,590
so that maybe you can start making

130
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,060
changes and finally just grow up because

131
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,160
you know it's never too late to start

132
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,169
really you think I can make that big of

133
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,970
a change to my life this fast yes I do

134
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,500
you really think I can rent a movie or a

135
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,390
TV show in the next like three months

136
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,010
people have done it in less so I could

137
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,780
really have the toilet aquarium room

138
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,370
thing well that's kind of pushing it

139
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,900
timewise but I suppose if your movie

140
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,210
makes enough money I guess in terms of

141
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,040
marriage I mean we live in Vegas I could

142
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,350
get married today if I wanted to right

143
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,580
technically true but I think we still

144
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,500
want to make sure we find the right one

145
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,450
if I get married today I could start a

146
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,040
family like immediately I mean why wait

147
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,990
right yes I suppose you could you could

148
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,580
start thinking about having no not think

149
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,470
about it I just need to do it I mean I

150
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,790
don't want to be an old dad

151
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,530
has no energy to play with their kids so

152
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,690
I need to have both kids by the age of

153
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,820
30 I mean it is possible if you choose

154
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,800
to adopt kids oh I want my own blood

155
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,150
kids I want blood kids two of them I was

156
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,710
kind of hoping there would be two years

157
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,060
apart but I guess we could settle for

158
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,380
two months if I have the first one this

159
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,460
month had the next one in the next

160
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,800
couple months you know that's not

161
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,720
possible right I know it'll be difficult

162
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,850
but if I work really hard and I vote

163
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,680
Ryan think about what you're saying okay

164
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,750
you only have about what four months

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,950
left this kid has been going on so long

166
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:42,770
you might have even less than that

167
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:45,340
I mean like less than three I don't even

168
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,340
know why I bother

169
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,480
so anyway point I'm trying to make if it

170
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,030
isn't already clear I was not and I

171
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,800
guess I'm still not prepared to turn 30

172
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,290
and I guess I'm kind of having a midlife

173
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,919
crisis which means not only am i getting

174
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:03,520
old but I am already at my midlife at 29

175
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:07,820
years that means I'm only a little 58

176
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,440
and and that that is so much more time I

177
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,570
don't even know why I'm freaking out 29

178
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,130
years that's almost 30 years that's two

179
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,990
more dogs I can have back-to-back they

180
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,750
can live and die I'll still be around

181
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,160
for almost sorry all this time off as

182
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:27,470
you can see thinking about life and

183
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:29,240
death has made me a little well dork all

184
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,979
jokes aside I know age is just a number

185
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,720
it's not the most important thing in the

186
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,430
world the thing is I'm really starting

187
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,930
to notice differences in myself now that

188
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,640
I'm getting older and I didn't realize

189
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,530
it was happening until I took these few

190
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,000
months off to reflect now I know it's

191
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,360
already too late for me I've already

192
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,490
caught the old

193
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,870
but for you young whippersnappers out

194
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,430
there I'm gonna tell you guys about the

195
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,710
changes I've been noticing in myself so

196
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,870
that maybe maybe you guys can catch it

197
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,080
before it happens to you before you guys

198
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,759
catch the old I was gonna make a

199
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,099
coronavirus joke but I just found that

200
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:05,050
in bad taste is it our people so

201
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:07,539
sensitive these days I don't know man

202
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,490
I'm old now I don't I feel like I'm a I

203
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:11,199
just I feel like I have the right to

204
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,939
offend people because I'm just that age

205
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,210
now where like I just don't know better

206
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:19,150
because I'm old coronavirus too soon

207
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:25,270

turn off the light again oh man dark

210
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:35,379
comedy early detection is everything and

211
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:36,940
one of the first things I started

212
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,469
noticing about myself is I've started

213
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,449
noticing and catching myself saying

214
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:42,069
things that I've heard all people say my

215
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:43,569
whole life the next level past

216
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:45,400
discovering that you're starting to say

217
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,900
things that old people say or the old

218
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,550
people sounds you start to make and

219
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,960
these are the real minuscule things you

220
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,400
might not have noticed throughout your

221
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,740
life I don't know when I started doing

222
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:58,949
this but I started doing them as well

223
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,949
[Music]

224
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:23,650
you know back in my day well okay you

225
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:27,699

226
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:30,490
tic-tac-toe large market what the flog

228
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,610
don't know what flarg is I don't think

229
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,870
that's a thing the point I was trying to

230
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,399
make is that old people don't like to

231
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,719
curse so they replaced curse words with

232
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,430
other words I'm just I'm just gonna be

233
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,169
honest I just made that word up because

234
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,820
I didn't want to put anything close to a

235
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,930
swear word in here even put the beep

236
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,370
sound in because I don't want to get to

237
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,019
monetize seriously like YouTube doesn't

238
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,910
even want you to put those sensor beeps

239
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,779
anymore or it could flag it as like

240
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,730
age-restricted

241
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,339
I mean what's next you know I mean I

242
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,000
remember back in my day youtube did not

243
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:57,680
care about things like

244
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,230
know why I went so there now this next

245
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,390
one I've always been old in I guess it's

246
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,070
the kids lingo these days I was always

247
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,380
behind when he came to trends even like

248
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,270
five years ago I kinda knew memes I kind

249
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,400
of knew like what kids were saying these

250
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,110
days today I have no idea what the hell

251
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,760
kids are talking about when I say kids I

252
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,460
mean people that are still in their

253
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:21,920
early 20s because to me I can understand

254
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:26,000

lights on the ceilings and on the sides

258
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,280
there was like almost no shadows no caps

259
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,710

260
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,080

smashley no her name is not actually

264
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,790
smashley

265
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:54,440
right and you mean I usually doesn't

266
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,970
gonna nickname no it's it's good that

267
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,580
would be ridiculous if her real name was

268
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,339
smashley like it is in smash then what

269
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:08,510
does she like a Playstation came Smash

270
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:11,450
Bros ooh but she so bad and obese her

271
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:13,940
body mass index probably twice the

272
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:17,530
normal rate of like an average person at

273
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,300
that height right yeah oh no cat right

274
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,950
another old person thing I have been

275
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,080
getting new interests that are not

276
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,940
gaming or YouTube I've been more

277
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,830
interested in politics I have been

278
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,680
trying to read more books but probably

279
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,180
worst of all I have been kind of into

280
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,400
learning about the stock market I'm not

281
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:39,640
gonna lie I'm getting pretty good at it

282
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:42,110
[Music]

283
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,720
what are you trying to learn about

284
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,640
stocks yeah I just can't decide which

285
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,310
stock to buy what are you interested in

286
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,900
just the broth really the broth you know

287
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:56,360
I just can't decide between like chicken

288
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:58,850
or beef wish stock would you buy aren't

289
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,169
you a little bit old to be making these

290
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:04,639
kinds of corny Joe horn stock

291
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:06,949
and last but not least and probably the

292
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,679
most cliche way to spot someone who's

293
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:11,389
getting old we all know this one it's

294
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,129
about music everyone grows up with a

295
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,989
certain generation of music and for some

296
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:16,970
reason the the generation of music you

297
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:18,410
grow up with will always be the best no

298
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,259
matter what and the moment you feel that

299
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,519
music quote unquote these days aren't as

300
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:23,929
good as it used to be when you were

301
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,419
growing up chances are you've already

302
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:28,549
contracted deal and the thing is once

303
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,959
you're at this point you don't recover

304
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:31,879
from it it only gets worse and worse

305
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,759
newer music becomes more and more

306
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:36,259
unlistenable to you and not only do you

307
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,879
resort back to the music you grew up

308
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:39,470
with but you start having an

309
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:41,329
appreciation for the music from the

310
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,249
generation before you and the generation

311
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:47,230
before that and so on even before you

312
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:50,929
know it it happens you're just old and

313
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:53,779
the truly truly terrifying part about

314
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:56,689
all of this is that you stop caring that

315
00:11:53,779 --> 00:12:03,290
you're old because really truly old

316
00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:23,740

I I still care how bad I look in these

323
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:43,640
here you know these back you really just

324
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,380
don't want to grow up huh what are you

325
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,880

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,110

327
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,100
just gonna be straight up with you

328
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,800
because I care

329
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,990
this whole video is about you worrying

330
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,040
about getting old but when I look at you

331
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,779
all I see is a child thank you no it's

332
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,520
not a compliment okay look there's

333
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,070
nothing wrong with getting old everybody

334
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,050
ages alright the only thing that's sad

335
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,240
about you turning 30 isn't the fact that

336
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,010
you're acting older that you're changing

337
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,990
in any way it's the fact that you're not

338
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,149
you're exactly the same

339
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,560
there's been no growth from you in years

340
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,589
and I don't think you've even noticed

341
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,410
that no I have I mean I know I've been

342
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:23,570
five nine since high school I have grown

343
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,279
about 15 pounds since then though so

344
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,870
there's that see this is exactly what

345
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,100
I'm talking about you can't even go 30

346
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,110
seconds without making some kind of

347
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,940
stupid joke how do you expect to become

348
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:36,640
me if you're not willing to change look

349
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:39,649
no offense but I don't want to become me

350
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,450
I'm not trying to be you okay I might

351
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:43,430
not be the most mature person in the

352
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,899
world and I wear the same clothes that

353
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,029
I've been wearing for the past decade

354
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:49,550
and yeah I still think puns are one of

355
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:53,329
the funniest things ever created by God

356
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:55,190
is not a God creation got a disagree but

357
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:57,500
like you are everything I thought I

358
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,630
wanted to be by age 30 but now that

359
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,620

360
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:06,260

362
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,890
what I thought 30 year old me was gonna

363
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,200
look like as a kid you're just an idea

364
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,600
from a kid version of me and I'm Way

365
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,430
smarter than kid me kidding me this is

366
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,290
ridiculous I don't even know what to say

367
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,850
roughly because you're dumb no it's

368
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,490
because I'm too intelligent to be

369
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,980
engaging with someone like you engage me

370
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,390
I'm just trying to marry you weirdo no

371
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,040
that's not what I meant just face it man

372
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:30,170
you're stupid you're the one who wants

373
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,790
app not just one but two biological kids

374
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,950
by the time you're 30 that's it for

375
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,930
months that's just not realistic well

376
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,010
with that attitude I guess look I know

377
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,840
exactly what

378
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,310
do all right I know that you're not that

379
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,660
dumb and I know you're not even in

380
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,460
denial you're just trolling because

381
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,380
that's the only way that you know how to

382
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,120
cope with something as important to your

383
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,320
life as this and it's not going your way

384
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,980
am i right

385
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,450
that's stupid another dumb thing to come

386
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,270
out of your mouth like cut the act

387
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,250
already man you're gonna be 30 seriously

388
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,170
you know damn well that it takes nine

389
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,910
months to have a baby and and that's

390
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,530
assuming you already have somebody who's

391
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,300
willing to have a baby with you which

392
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,860
you don't so just so you can finally

393
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,540
admit to yourself and hear it out loud

394
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,770
I'm telling you you're not gonna have

395
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,690
the life you thought you were gonna have

396
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,220
by age 30 you're not gonna be married

397
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,540
you're not gonna be done with YouTube

398
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,460
you're not gonna do anything really

399
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,990
significant for this world and most

400
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,110
importantly you're not gonna be done

401
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:23,360
making those silly awful puns basically

402
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,010
dad jokes despite the fact that you're

403
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,240
not gonna be a dad by the time you're 30

404
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:30,620
maybe not ever

405
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,430
it's time to face reality right it's

406
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,069
time to grow up

407
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,139
[Music]

408
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:40,769
right

409
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:43,139
I've wasted so much time I I know I

410
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:44,819
won't be married I know I probably won't

411
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,889
be done with you two but I won't do

412
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:49,499
anything significant for the world

413
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:51,720
really doing this it doesn't mean you

414
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:54,749
can't start trying now no I've already

415
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,509
accepted that the only thing I can't

416
00:16:54,749 --> 00:17:01,970
accept because I know that if I change

417
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:01,970
right now I could have it

418
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:11,240
I will have my two kids and by the age

419
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,730
of thirty this is literally the only

420
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,980
thing you can't do nine months to have a

421
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,589
baby you say huh yes you already know

422
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:25,060
that well then I guess I'll just have to

423
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:25,060
have twins

424
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,920
that makes Margit dance
