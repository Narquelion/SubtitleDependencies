only use 10% of the frames capacity

18
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,470
imagine if we could access 100%

19
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:46,300
interesting things begin to help a guy

l.jackson I just Rika PD at all your

22
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,370
research about the human brain it's a

23
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,240
little boring but at least there were

24
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,550
some pictures in it

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,320
I thank you seems this drug is actually

26
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,910
enabling you to use your brain nearly

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,920
three times the amount of the average

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,380
person which in theory should make you a

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,060
super genius I in UN but it also seems

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,690
your brain is helping how do I put this

31
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,790
politely

32
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,920
much much much dumber than the average

33
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,600
person so not only you're not a super

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,709
genius like you're still way below

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:17,050
average I knew it you currently have

36
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,880
access to 28% of your brain and it'll

37
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,140
only go from there wait what how would

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,880
that even finish out of my hands not

39
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,100
changing in size you're just using more

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,640
of but you just said I have 28 persons

41
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,500
brains

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,620

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,350
Center said percent are 78 percent

44
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,900
caution I can feel every living thing

45
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,780

46
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,860
could never do before this is a book

47
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,510

48
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:52,990

49
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:57,180

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,480
the blue stuff makes me smarter but then

[Music]

55
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,210
well there are tubes in the equation and

56
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,620
the number two sounds like the letter U

57
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,780
and the letter U is between the letters

58
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,770
T MB in the alphabet but chi-chi's are

59
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,480
really relevant anymore because

60
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,070
everybody has computers now so it's

61
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:33,540
kinda like if you have two TVs just like

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:33,540
was it even four that's right I knew it

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,450
I feel like I've exceeded my limits like

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,130
if there are limits for me before now

65
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,440
there's less of those limits if not no

66
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,700
limits at all I just feel limitless you

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,190

68
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,970
