00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
hey guys so Thanksgiving was yesterday I

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,770
mean coasted a video called things that

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,879
ruin Thanksgiving part 2 where basically

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,160
we had to make a whole Thanksgiving

5
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,480
dinner as props for the video shoot my

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,769
parents actually came into town and

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,290
cooked a whole another Thanksgiving

8
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,849
dinner so now we have like way too much

9
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,440
food and rather than eating leftovers

10
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,850
until all the food goes bad and we have

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,650
to throw it away and waste it I thought

12
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,449
why not just pack it up right now while

13
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,710
it's still good and give it to somebody

14
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,880
who needs it more than we do and today

15
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,289
that's what we're gonna do we just

16
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,490
finished packing up all these meals and

17
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,140
we're gonna go deliver them to the

18
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,429
homeless people of Las Vegas which if

19
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,689
you don't know there's a lot of them and

20
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,920
yes we already called the Las Vegas

21
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,570
police department to make sure that it

22
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,130
was legal to do miss sadly it's illegal

23
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,329
to feed the homeless in certain states

24
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,469
believe it or not because the last time

25
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,820
I did this in a video called Christmas

26
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,469
ninja where I gave away food and

27
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
presents to kids and random homeless

28
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,110
people sadly I got a lot of people

29
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,520
saying that it was illegal to do and I

30
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,320
shouldn't be doing that I personally

31
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,789
think is ridiculous and discouraged is

32
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,320
helping other people but whatever we got

33
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,280
the okay so we're good to go but you

34
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,870
know what's even more fun than that

35
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,219
feeding the homeless and not getting

36
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:59,609
caught as a ninja this is the wrong way

37
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,579
this is still a wrong way it's almost

38
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,640
there there we go just like a vulnerable

39
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,780
spot for an enjoyment gotta fix this

40
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,780
here's a walk around this I guess

41
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:18,289
what's the play
