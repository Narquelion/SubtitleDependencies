1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,319
you've seen the videos primitive

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,940
technology primitive survival and all

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,560
the other primitive building type of

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,150
videos that have gone viral over the

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,590
past year usually just one or two guys

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,929
in the middle of the wilderness building

7
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,670
a house or a pool or a house with a pool

8
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,470
all kinds of structures from scratch

9
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,960
without saying a single word throughout

10
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,210
the entire experience well on this the

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,470
very first episode of Ryan tries where I

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,510
try to do things that I probably

13
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,490
shouldn't try I'm going to attempt to

14
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,990
create a primitive building video of my

15
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,580
very own but instead of going to the

16
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,349
jungle we're going to the mountains

17
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,270
joining me on this challenge would be

18
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:42,329
one of my longtime very very good

19
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:45,360
friends Gregory and what we're gonna be

20
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,559
doing is building an epic gigantic snow

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,940
fort entirely from scratch what are you

22
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,399
so we're going on snowboarding trip I

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,559
sure did Gregory but I can assure you we

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,020
surely are not because what we're gonna

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,359
be doing instead is from morning tonight

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,609
every single inch of daylight that we

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,460
have we're gonna be building and working

28
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,320
and carrying it sweating until there's

29
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,900
no time for snowboarding what do you

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,070
mean like that video we did before why

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,020
would you want to do anything like that

32
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,760
took us all day yes and I know how

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,250
exhausting it was but let me tell you

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,110
this one is gonna be so much funner

35
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,570
because not only are we building this

36
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,280
for bigger and better than last time but

37
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,560
we're going primitive which means we

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,390
have access to no tools we won't have

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,430
seven other people helping us it'll just

40
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,200
be me and you and instead of one long

41
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,780
exhausting day of manual labor

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,620
let's multiply that by three welcome to

43
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,959
