1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
first there was the Nintendo followed by

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,450
the game-changing Super Nintendo

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,210
involving two for player technology with

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,309
the n64 and GameCube advancing into 3d

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,259
and held human detection of the Wii and

6
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,509
the groundbreaking hybrid console

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,070
Nintendo sweat cheated us all the way to

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,470
our most recent cutting-edge

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,449
state-of-the-art glorified origami

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,000
cardboard technology known as the

11
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,160
Nintendo now wait are you serious

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,650
cardboard yeah that's the stupidest

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,150
thing I've ever heard Lee $70 a cake and

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,340
the people who brought you none of the

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,010
things mentioned earlier me now present

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,010
the Nintendo paper my name is Ryan Higa

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,410
and I am the CEO of Nintendo with a name

18
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,120
when I first heard of a Nintendo lab I

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,040
thought wow this is brilliant this is

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,140
genius but it's just kind of missing

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,210
something it wasn't quite there I mean

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,670
it was cool it was it was dope it just

23
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,410
wasn't Nintendo it was literally like an

24
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,879
in-out of Tendo and not a 10 out of 10

25
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,199
dough like a 10-10 dough you know

26
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,120
cardboard is something to be really

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,620
focused on years ago and now that

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,780
Nintendo is doing it it just goes to

29
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,239
show you that we're leading the pack and

30
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,070
we're headed in the right direction

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,810
backwards people don't want to invent

32
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,790
technology anymore they're sick of all

33
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,140
these newer smarter more advanced

34
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,119
products to give fidgets spinners

35
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,530
kendamas slime humble wrappers people

36
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,180
don't want better they want to go

37
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,159
backwards that's why the Nintendo paper

38
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,130
is perfect for this generation with an

39
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,340
8.5 x 11 inch paper screen and with of

40
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,380
less than 0.1 mm it weighs only five

41
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,000
making it not only one of the largest

42
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,920
screens out of any handheld console

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,600
today but also one of the lightest and

44
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,220
most portable thanks to its multi

45
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,110
bendable size and complete wireless

46
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,630
technology and even with a screen that

47
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,100
gigantic it's one

48
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,689
durable products on the market we've

49
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,700
performed countless stress tests from

50
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:42,079
drops to scratches to running it over

51
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,659
with a truck the screen just does not

52
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,430
crack however it isn't quite 100%

53
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,780
waterproof yet but our incredible team

54
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,399
of scientists are currently working on a

55
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,170
waterproof case and that's not going to

56
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,520
be an issue for long now I know a lot of

57
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,200
people think that this is just some kind

58
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,899
of money grab because on the outside it

59
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,039
might look like a normal average useless

60
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,569
piece of paper but that's just because

61
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,979
technology has just sucked the

62
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,689
creativity out of people and just like

63
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,069
the lab with a Nintendo paper - to bring

64
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:08,049
back that creativity and imagination

65
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:08,049
because when you use your imagination

66
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,500
wait no what why am I talking like this

67
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,250
because like I went back like 10 years

68
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,620
or something

69
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,209

70
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,829

71
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,660
when you were a kid and you didn't have

72
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:43,100
the technology to create a world better

73
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,750

74
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,700
true mission here at Nintendo with the

75
