1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,510
do you write can you make a boy bad

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,009
music video about games we got asked to

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,520
do something very similar before but I

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:11,660
think it was about um posted sandwiches

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,070
[Music]

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,780
yep that's what it was there's a small

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,070
part of a bigger deer Ryan I remember

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,690
because so many of you were commenting

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,830
about how you wanted the full version of

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,060
this song you guys are commenting more

11
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,050
about that small part that dear Ryan

12
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,760
than you were about the rest of the

13
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,619
videos so that was shocking guys I

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,570
recorded the entire song in my closet

15
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,160
using a very cheap microphone and using

16
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,279
stock GarageBand that it comes with

17
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,380
every single Mac and it sounded awesome

18
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,820
so yeah I just try probably sort of put

19
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,620
it on I it was just kidding in the so

20
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,750
bad we were trying to parody basically

21
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,550
90's boy band it's back in the 90s way

22
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,440
if you are alive then didn't seem cringy

23
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,910
then but you go and watch them now it's

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,649
a straight-up big old-fashioned

25
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,100
cringefest why do that you'd have to say

26
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,110
it like that

27
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,239
I am so off topic back to the video hey

28
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,129
guys I probably should have comment on

29
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,260
this first but as you can see the vlog

30
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,039
room has finally completed crazy of

31
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,449
Shawn and Dana

32
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,859
they actually surprised me and created

33
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,899
this whole thing without me knowing what

34
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,890
it was gonna be and I love it they have

35
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,600
a second channel video coming soon

36
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,860
showing the whole thing anyway so now

37
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,810
that everything is set and I'm all moved

38
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,189
in we can finally get back into the

39
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,810
swing of things I know I know we've been

40
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,580
a little slow on posting videos lately

41
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,720
that's you know carrying over from last

42
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,040
year as well it's completely my fault

43
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,869
not only because of the whole moving

44
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,740
situation getting messed up but also

45
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:24,330
because well I I don't know how else to

46
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:27,030
say this but I I relapsed again um it's

47
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,860
hard for me to talk about as some of you

48
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:35,070
guys already know I have had a very

49
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,619
dangerous addiction to well

50
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,440
[Music]

51
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:43,580
I've had a dangerous addiction to it

52
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,580
[Music]

53
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:51,689
when I get stressed out I okay find this

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,640
bit is not funny addiction is a real

55
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,350
thing I know see this is just paper I

56
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,500
don't actually smoke this was root beer

57
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,789
and well this one's real as you guys

58
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,829
know I kind of do have an addiction to

59
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:03,390
energy drinks but you know what's the

60
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,130
big deal nobody ever gets hurt from

61
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,780
energy my chest

62
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,679
the real dangerous addiction I relapse

63
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,209
into was well gaming too much energy

64
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,200
drinks and I know I know a lot of you

65
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,940
think that this is some kind of joke

66
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,560
it's not when I get really into games it

67
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,700
harms every aspect of my life because

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,069
I'm one of those people that you know

69
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,510
when I get into a game I get really into

70
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,920
it you know because it's fun my eating

71
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,480
patterns changed because I forget to eat

72
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,620
a lot of times I skip meals when I'm

73
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,269
playing games free time that I would

74
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,769
normally use to work out or go hang out

75
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:30,329
with people in real life go straight to

76
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:31,860
gaming I'm constantly sleep-deprived

77
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,840
because I keep pushing myself making

78
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,180
four hours is enough sleep three hours

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,280
so you still feel okay - it's not that

80
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,900
bad well the sun's already up so I might

81
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,120
as well stay up I mean I got these I

82
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,739
don't really need it I'm sure a lot of

83
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,000
you gamers have very similar experiences

84
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,560
maybe not all of you but one of the

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,420
biggest things that gaming can take a

86
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,010
toll on relationships because more than

87
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,090
anything gaming takes away your time and

88
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,260
your attention and that's one of the

89
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,549
most important things you need for a

90
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,780
relationship so if you're a hardcore

91
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,519
gamer and you want to have a

92
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,840
relationship really think about it

93
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,639
before you get into one you're probably

94
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,269
gonna have to sacrifice something things

95
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,530
are gonna change

96
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,329
I'm not saying it's not possible to have

97
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,250
both there's always a balance but trust

98
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:09,510
me something has got to give and it's

99
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:20,910
just not gonna be the same so unless

100
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:26,639
he's behind for a little bit just

101
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:28,590
protect me okay I'll admit it I did

102
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,739
forget that I agreed to go shopping with

103
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,799
you today but um in my defense I do

104
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,989
recall saying I didn't want to really is

105
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,090
it that much to ask you spend a few

106
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,069
hours with me together well I mean we

107
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,800
spend tons of hours together why does it

108
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,270
have to be out shopping like

109
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,980
need anything new we own that we have

110
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,270
groceries it's not about shopping it's

111
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,310
about spending quality time together

112
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,480
just you and me except all you want to

113
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,310

what playing your games well yeah I mean

117
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,990
you just said that it's not about what

118
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,990
we do it's just supposed to be

119
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:18,830

pretty average lately yeah I might have

161
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,530
dropped a little it's only because I've

162
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,569
been working so hard like one of us has

163
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,979
