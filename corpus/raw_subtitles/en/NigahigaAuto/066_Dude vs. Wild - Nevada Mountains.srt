00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,869

38
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:44,630
oh all right I'm here at the spot and I

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,140

40
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:52,329
we go

41
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:53,719
like they say in French adios amigos ah

42
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:56,689
here we go

43
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,130
how you doing Sean that's it yeah what's

44
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:00,110
that you're not even gonna wear like a

45
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:04,759
fake parachute I'm not even gonna wear a

46
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:06,369
fake pair of shoes really crocks crikey

47
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,349
mate

48
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:11,390
it's not even the same accent Sean and I

49
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:13,640
have a long boring uneventful walk ahead

50
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,900
of us before we reach our first stop so

51
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,060
it's a good thing we have multiple

52
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,280
angles beautiful shots of nature and

53
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,720
very important life-changing questions

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,730
to feel that time hey you know the

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,709
survival shows where they cuts a bunch

56
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,260
of shots of and angles of people walking

57
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:29,569
and whatnot yeah why well don't you

58
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,459
think like in that one wide shot that

59
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,620
they have don't you have a one like wait

60
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,459
where's all the cameramen you know do

61
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,049
you think with all the different angles

62
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,180
and whatnot you'd see like a few people

63
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:40,400
here and there and hey look we're at the

64
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,400
end of the wide if we can just walk in

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,510
silence now yes you're right you could

66
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,510
catch Johnny boy yes

67
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,739
so we've been out here for about three

68
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,540
or four minutes now and I think I'm

69
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,930
about ready to go home now all right

70
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,430
Sean here's our first challenge what we

71
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,989
got to keep heading in this direction so

72
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,879
what we're gonna need to do is climb

73
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:05,769
this cliff right here make it to the top

74
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,330
and push forward he's there hiss that's

75
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,069
so dangerous I'm not gonna climb that

76
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,269
Sean we have to climb this you just told

77
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:11,560
me that we're gonna go on looks like a

78
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,060
little hike I didn't think we're gonna

79
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,560
do anything crazy like this can't we

80
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,150
just like walk around it I mean if you

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,829
want to hike another 20 miles that way

82
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,540
and spend another day out here I suppose

83
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:21,209
we could do that but if you don't want

84
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,700
to do that we have to climb this cliff

85
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,579
this is crazy Sean I've been a survival

86
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,290
expert for about four five maybe even

87
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:30,430
six minutes now I'm not gonna let

88
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,629
anything bad happen to you you have

89
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,970
nothing to worry about

90
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:38,799
would you trust me no oh well then we

91
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,379
are in quite the cucumber dipped in

92
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,599
vinegar aren't we that's a pickle by the

93
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:45,400
way you know what a pickle is the

94
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,079
ancient natives had pickles god I really

95
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,030
don't want to spend another day with you

96
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:51,180
fine yeah let's do it

97
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,040
oh all right Johnny boy that's a spirit

98
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,750
climbing a cliff is no easy task it's

99
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,849
incredibly dangerous and should not be

100
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,980
attempted without a professional however

101
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,630
if it's your first time rock climbing

102
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,940
you'll have beginner's luck and bad

103
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,590
should be enough all right I guess all

104
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,540
that's left to do is to just go in and

105
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,250
climb this mountain then shouldn't we

106
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,500
like for a rope or something up there to

107
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,910
like give us support in case we fall you

108
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,190
know what gonna be a survival expert

109
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,019
yourself good cat Sean I almost forgot

110
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,060
about this all right so whenever you're

111
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,530
climbing a cliff or a mountain or any

112
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,570
kind of really dangerous Heights where

113
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,740
you could possibly fall what you want to

114
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,320
do especially if you have a bunch of

115
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,060
rope like so pull it up like this bunch

116
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,139
it up just like that and then you're

117
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,240
just gonna what but yeah just like that

118
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,620
and and then you should be good to go

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,150
because the last thing you want when

120
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,289
you're climbing a cliff is using any

121
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,490
kind of rope you don't want to mess with

122
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:41,020
it and then all of a sudden you get all

123
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,430
tangled and then you know you might

124
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,500
mistake it for some kind of snake and

125
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,389
you're like oh no snake let me let go of

126
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,520
this club yeah I'm about a hundred

127
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,099
percent sure that he's never climbed

128
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,669
anything ever in his life but what are

129
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:54,849
my options

130
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:57,729
I either I'm this cliff and possibly die

131
00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:00,090
or not climb the cliff and have to spend

132
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:02,740
another day with him so

133
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,229
yeah I think I'd rather risk dying so

134
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,020
John has no idea but uh I've actually

135
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:10,150
never climbed a cliff before I mean I

136
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,710
didn't lie I have Rock climbed but it

137
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,240
was one of those cliffs with the

138
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,310
colorful rocks and the people voiced you

139
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,430
up and stuff so it's a little bit safer

140
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,770
but I've never actually climbed a cliff

141
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,139
even with that rock wall I only made it

142
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,500
about a quarter of the way up then I got

143
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:26,220
scared

144
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,540
I do have an uncle named cliff though

145
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,430
there's that all right so I'm gonna go

146
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,860
up there first just remember whatever

147
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,240
you do do not look down and do not panic

148
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,490
that's one of the biggest mistakes

149
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,880
people make in the wild so just follow

150
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,680
after me let me go up here we go never

151
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,539
you're rock climbing you must always be

152
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,389
patient and take it one step at a time

153
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:53,260
make one wrong move and it could all be

154
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:56,320
over I was a really close one Oh almost

155
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,850
fell on all the way back Oh Oh God

156
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,070
you okay I look down I don't like

157
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,010
Heights I should have looked down what

158
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,750
do i do John I know I should have done

159
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,010
this Sean Hill but you're not even that

160
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,639
high right now he can just walk right

161
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:14,139
back down you're not even at the steep

162
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:16,720
part okay I just hurry up just calm down

163
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:22,960
just calm down okay come here help okay

164
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:25,570
that's a hug me it's okay okay we'll

165
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,539
just slide slide down the hill okay

166
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:34,389
we're here right here okay okay just

167
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:35,500
give me a minute okay all right a new

168
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,720
plan I just thought of it

169
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,550
since the Rope is still up there you

170
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,840
know actually only one of us needs to go

171
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,250
up there Andy and once you get up there

172
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,810
you can help pull the other person up

173
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,580
with the rope okay sounds good

174
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,400
right so when you get up there what I

175
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,349
want you to do with me yeah why do I

176
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,849
have to go up because I'm heavier what

177
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:53,530
you're not even that much heavier than

178
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:54,760
me and even if you were how is it better

179
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:59,080
for the lighter person to pull up the

180
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,520
heavier person science look I'll tell

181
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,260
you what okay as you're going up

182
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,330
whichever way you go I'll be right below

183
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,570
you so just in case you fall I'll be

184
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,560
right there to take off my bag and throw

185
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,120
it on the ground so you have something

186
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,800
to fall on and you'll be fine sound good

187
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,090
I guess let's just get this over with

188
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,830
all right let's do this good luck my new

189
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,580
plan seems to be working almost

190
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,680
perfectly

191
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,479
it seems Shawn historian to fatigue as

192
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,979
he approaches the talk well I have to

193
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,840
think fast and come up with a back-up

194
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,840
plan just in case you get stuck

195
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:43,330
[Music]

196
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:46,900
oh oh oh my god I made it thank God

197
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,729
yes well that was awesome Sean I was

198
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,639
absolutely phenomenal how'd you get up

199
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:53,050
here yeah you're just down there oh yeah

200
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,610
see things so funny you're gonna laugh

201
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,050
at this so at the end that I thought

202
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,360
you're gonna fall I went to go gather

203
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,580
some leaves and you know brush and some

204
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,620
rocks for you to fall on and in the

205
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,180
process on the side of the mountain I

206
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,860
found this trail that comes all the way

207
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,969
to the top this is not funny we didn't

208
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,330
need to climb at all

209
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:11,979
yeah funny hey you have to check this

210
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,110
out this view is amazing

211
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,240
get over here Sean and I enjoy a moment

212
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,190
of nature I realized that it's the

213
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,419
perfect time for a deep and emotional

214
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,389
part of the show

215
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:25,330
I got father would have loved to see

216
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:27,009
this right now all right yeah before he

217
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,050
passed he's to always take us camping

218
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:30,969
and fishing and he just loved everything

219
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,680
about nature so I really wish he could

220
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,050
have been here yeah I know I can

221
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,669
definitely relate to that you know I've

222
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,200
always wanted to bring my own father as

223
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,110
well he's the he's the same way as a

224
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,110
grandfather and you know recently he

225
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:46,240
passed so sorry no it's it's fine it's

226
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,100
it is what it is but I just I really

227
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,980
wish that one day he could really just

228
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:57,410
be out here with me

229
00:08:49,980 --> 00:09:00,149
see this Hey I think he already is what

230
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,760
what you're not my father

231
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:04,980
no not me I meant like his spirit its

232
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,360
spirit what are you that's not funny you

233
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,190
trying to say that my father's dead what

234
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,930
you just said he passed yeah I asked him

235
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,389
to come out here and he said thanks son

236
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,430
but I'll have to pass I would spend an

237
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:15,839
entire day with you in the wild for your

238
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,670
stupid little show but I'd much rather

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,750
be dead than do that something like that

240
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,730
I don't know I'm not a good impression -

241
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,410
so he has a weird accident but my point

242
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,940
is is that he's not dead it's a really

243
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,529
messed up thing to say actually your

244
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,300
comedy is a little bit too dark for me

245
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:29,100
anyway we better get moving before it

246
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,040
actually gets dark out we don't want to

247
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,290
end up like your grandfather right right

248
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,639
you get it cuz you're because if when he

249
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,480
gets dark the predator might attack us

250
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,529
anyway my dad um yes I get it

251
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,540
no I don't think you get it because you

252
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,930
didn't want laughing isn't funny - okay

253
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,420
then

254
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,250
so we're mad sometimes in the wild

255
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,019
things can get a little frustrating and

256
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,209
I'm starting to suspect that Sean's

257
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:54,380
getting a little irritable mean yeah I'm

258
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:56,910
pretty annoyed I mean aren't you guys

259
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,100
Sean's irritable nurses probably due to

260
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,230
the hunger settling in if we don't find

261
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,510
nutrients for him soon he may catch a

262
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,440
bad case of the hangers and literally

263
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,449
starve to death

264
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,829
all right so we're actually really close

265
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:09,420
to the extraction point we just got to

266
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:11,250
climb one more Hill but if we're gonna

267
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,810
make it all that way we have to find

268
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,790
some food in nutrients for Sean before

269
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,860
he starts to death what I'm not even

270
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,350
starving I'm not even hungry but luckily

271
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,910
for him I know exactly where to look and

272
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,160
I'm not gonna let that happen so come on

273
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,019
ate like two hours ago before we started

274
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,820
this and you're in the wild you have to

275
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,800
be resourceful and know where to look it

276
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,320
may take some time but you have to be

277
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,269
persistent and keep your cool can expect

278
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,699
food to just magically fall out of a

279
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:38,850
tree check this out

280
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:40,410
right here and that is how you do it see

281
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,360
a lot of people don't think to look up

282
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,819
in the tree for food but it's actually

283
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,560
very common for people to just get a

284
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:53,790
bucket of chicken bring it out to the

285
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:58,199
forest and then just sit no oh what's

286
00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:02,250
wrong no why who the F one of them has

287
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,620
no skin who the greedy but just comes in

288
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,270
here

289
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,890
he's all the skin illegal you know the

290
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:14,440
driest late pointless pointless what

291
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:16,180
kind of rock really upset I guess that's

292
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,680
just like his pet peeve or something I

293
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,600
don't know maybe the dude just really

294
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,430
loves fried chicken skin I mean it's

295
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,170
common sense it's common courtesy basic

296
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,100
manners you know like if you're gonna if

297
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,170
you're gonna leave a bucket of chicken

298
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,700
on a branch and a tree in the middle

299
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,820
than the matter Mountains tell me all

300
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:35,710
the skin or just the skin or at least

301
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:38,440
leave some gravy or something why ask me

302
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,960
hey you're right yeah no I'm I'm good

303
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,000
now so I'm I listen I am so sorry about

304
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,880
that showing off no no it's fine that's

305
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,710
a totally reasonable way to react to not

306
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,870
having chicken skin on your chicken no

307
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,850
no no I know it's a natural reaction

308
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,250
that everybody anybody would have but I

309
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,780
should know better than to overreact you

310
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,490
never want to over act in the wild

311
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,120
that's one of the basic rules never lose

312
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,550
your cool and I did so for that I'm

313
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,510
sorry

314
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:09,130
what come on now what we really don't

315
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,420
have to we got to do this Shawn

316
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,560
if you want to go home let's just get

317
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,560

319
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:30,960
hey hey what what are you doing I had to

320
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,770
be sure sure of what you didn't take the

321
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:39,590
skins and you didn't and now I can trust

322
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:42,180
you for life come on let's go

323
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,010
the Nevada mountains are incredibly

324
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,840
dangerous but with the right technique

325
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:49,170
and knowledge and maintaining your cool

326
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:52,880
your pressive ear choppers right over

327
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,880
this hill this is the end

328
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,430
Shawn really really impressed me today

329
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,440
and he's definitely under my respect not

330
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,420
because of the bravery he showed or the

331
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,080
endurance that he had the entire trip

332
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,520
but because he didn't take the skins and

333
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,330
in the end that's all that really

334
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,330
matters isn't it

335
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,430
I'm ready I can't believe we made it

336
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:39,640
well you guys got an extra battery or a

337
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:42,070
charger what's all of this where's the

338
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,750
helicopter oh yeah you know about that I

339
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,680
don't think you know this but you know

340
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,540
the very beginning with the whole

341
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,970
helicopter dropping me off yeah we faked

342
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,270
that yeah I know yeah there was no

343
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,410
actual helicopter there's no helicopter

344
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:56,820
wait so you're telling me that we're

345
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,820
gonna have yeah we gotta walk back
