1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
hey guys as you know I made a bunch of

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,759
rants a while back you want to see them

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,259
well you can't because of copyrighted

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,570
music those videos are no longer

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,429
available for you to view so I'm gonna

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:23,550
be recreating those rents and more

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:25,380
starting off with music what happened to

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,269
music nowadays people are making songs

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,890
that I don't even consider music anymore

10
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,840
it's pretty much like fast repetitive

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,360
words with a beat yet artists are making

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,739
millions of dollars and I don't get it

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,120
it's like they come up with a line and

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,739
they're like this sounds pretty good I

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,020
think I'll repeat it 20 times in one

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,420
song what is the world coming to

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,530
imagine if books were like that there

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,270
were three things I was absolutely

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,700
positive first Edward was a vampire

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,870
second there was a part of him that

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,570
thirsty for my blood and third Edward

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,879
was a vampire see how stupid that sounds

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,190
now imagine if music were like that pop

24
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,710
up out pokerface pop pop pokerface ma ma

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,720
ma ma wait a second it already is like

26
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,070
that but seriously I thought music was

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,810
supposed to have meaning and even if

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,310
those repetitive songs do have meaning

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,680
it's kind of like okay we get what you

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,210
mean now move on anyway another thing I

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,490
don't like is when artists make songs

32
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,619
telling you what to do for example you

33
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,119
crank that Soulja Boy I don't want to

34
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,150
crank you I don't even know what that is

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,640
and next lean like a cholo come on a

36
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,799
cholo don't even speak Greek and last

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,500

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,079

39
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,960

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,460
feel like saying Destiny's Child second

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,340
of all I don't even know your name I

42
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,220

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,530
talented artist my favorite of all

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,360
that's right Sean Paul and for those of

46
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,070
you who don't know who Sean Paul is he's

the only guy in the entire world that

48
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,700
can create a whole song using his own

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,079
language that nobody can understand I

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,810
