1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,449
hey guys so as most of you all know we

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:10,559
are currently living in the era of big

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:12,599
booties and I'm assuming this is gonna

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,429
be another very unpopular opinion of

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,599
mine but honestly I don't get it and

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,279
don't get me wrong it's not like I don't

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,720
like people with big booties I just

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,830
personally never got into the trend and

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,480
I don't see why people get so excited

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,250
over there I guess I've always just been

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,480
a fan of proportion I already know the

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,369
responses I'm gonna get from you guys

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
for making this video because I have

14
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,060
mostly guy friends and if I were to ever

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,189
tell them personally I don't really care

16
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,480
for extremely big boobs and booties you

17
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,770
know they would probably answer back

18
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,460
with an incredibly well thought-out

19
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:42,570
intelligent response such as oh okay

20
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,219
and again I'm not saying that I don't

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,780
like butts in general I just don't see

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,309
the fascination and why having such a

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,809
big butt makes you more attractive I

24
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,340
mean the trend is so crazy now that

25
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,840
people have made careers off of having a

26
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,670
big bar look at Kim Kardashian or even

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,260
Nicki Minaj her song anaconda is

28
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,940
literally all about having a big butt

29
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,410
but why are big bucks considered to be

30
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,120
so attractive but you really think about

31
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,500
it butts are just another part of your

32
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,329
body that's mostly made up of muscle

33
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,280
with a huge layer of fat on it and yet

34
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,290
we love it we worship it homer society

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,670
loves and worships a layer of fat that

36
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,229
has no other use than to cushion your

37
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,580
spine when you sit down and not to

38
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,229
mention that layer of fat is where your

39
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,020
poo comes out as well so when people say

40
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,210
things like damn girl you got the

41
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,820
baddest booty I've ever seen what you're

42
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,799
really saying is damn girl you got the

43
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,240
baddest poop article covered fat layer

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,740
cushion for your spine that I've ever

45
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,780
seen what oh sorry I mean damn guy you

46
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,280
got the baddest yeah that's the era we

47
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,290
live in because having a big butt is a

48
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,640
must these days especially for girls I

49
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,740
grew up in the boob era where everybody

50
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,060
worship boobs instead of booties and the

51
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,350
bigger your boobs were it didn't matter

52
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,759
be in a small booty was yeah big boobs

53
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,560
and just like this whole booty trying to

54
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,350
think I was never really into super big

55
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,350
boobs either okay

56
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,490
but anyway he doesn't boobs made more

57
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,689
sense in the booty trend because leaps

58
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,189
are a sign of fertility so

59
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,509
scientifically it makes sense why guys

60
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,679
would be attracted to them I don't know

61
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,390
why I'm shaking them like they're

62
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:04,979
talking but I'm pretty sure most guys if

63
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,450
not all guys don't like girls with big

64
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,950
boobs just because they're more likely

65
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,330
to reproduce they just like how they

66
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,190
look which i think is stupid because

67
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,200
again boobs are mostly just fat plus

68
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:19,250
guys have them as well hey check out

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:21,540
this rack doh yeah two minutes a guy gay

70
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,010
what is wrong with you you can't say

71
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,569
that what do you mean say what gay

72
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,400
you've been calling me that this whole

73
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,870
video yeah but as a joke this one

74
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,849
actually has a guy name which could

75
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,819
really be gay so it's not just a joke

76
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,660
it's homophobic so disappointed in you I

77
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,010
don't know how I feel about this

78
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,099
friendship anymore I love gay people

79
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,420
don't like the side of you anyway I

80
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,769
think you get the point when you really

81
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,150
think about this big booty trend it

82
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:43,709
doesn't make sense and in fact I think

83
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,150
it's wrong and unfair in the same way

84
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,069
that ten years ago people used to say

85
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,420
that Kirby people were unattractive

86
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,220
because you had to be skinny to be

87
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,660
beautiful and I'm all for Team be

88
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,250
comfortable with how you look but this

89
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,840
big booty trend is doing the same thing

90
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,489
to skinny people what skinny people did

91
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,780
to bigger people before make them feel

92
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,880
like crap for not being big enough for

93
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,109
small enough we trained ourselves really

94
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,910
messed up but it's happening right now

95
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:05,010
just the other way around like literally

96
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,620
a Nicki Minaj's anaconda song she says

97
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,030
the skinny [ __ ] the skinny [ __ ] in

98
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,370
the club I want to see all the big fat

99
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,620
ass [ __ ] and the mother Club you if

100
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,850
you skinny [ __ ] one that's literally

101
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,319
in her song if she got away with it

102
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,819
because she said the word skin could you

103
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,260
imagine how bad it would sound if you

104
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,819
switched out the word fat and skinny

105
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,109
exactly it's totally messed up and

106
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,030
that's another reason why I think this

107
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:25,530
big booty trend is ridiculous well at

108
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,970
least into our media decides to change

109
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,680
things up and picks another random body

110
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,269
part to worship in fact we should start

111
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,799
the next body trend why not I mean I

112
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,920

make these bodies friends really catch

130
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,079
on we'd have to make it cool like

131
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:18,280
rappers do and put it in a rap song and

132
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,959

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,470
trend ideas trust me

134
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,050
I saved the best for last damn cow so

135
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,630
fat that jiggle when she stepped in take

136
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,940
your shoes off Asian hall oh I can see

137
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,360
that sending got them CDs to cuddle or

138
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,949
something she don't even need a Luger

139
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,949
let me pinch your wiener

140
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,020
feeling pretty good about that last one

141
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,460
pinching your weenus man that could be

142
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,260
the next work if you do it fast enough

143
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,360
but all jokes aside what I'm trying to

144
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,520
say is that it's not about having a big

145
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,170
booty or big boobs or being curvy or

146
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,880
being skinny my friends are gonna come

147
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,100
and go and if you really think about it

148
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,080
it's stupid how much we obsess over and

149
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,670
as corny and cliche as it sounds when it

150
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,380
comes to attractiveness the one thing

151
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,790
that will always be beautiful is a

152
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,080
beautiful personality and if you can

153
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,630
find that that's like hitting the

154
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,130
jackpot that's like finding of an emo

155
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,230
what no a leprechaun

156
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,670
no Neiman works because Nemo may not be

157
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,290
considered to be the most beautiful fish

158
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,910
I mean he's small and he has a deformed

159
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,230
fin but it's all about personality and

160
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,970
that's the part that we should be

161
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,200
obsessing over not just big boobs or

162
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,880
booties there's a lot of fishing to see

163
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,690
with big boobs and booty find the fish

164
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,640
that's different

165
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,620
find the fish that's unique to you find

166
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,660
the fish that is so lovable and so

167
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,950
charismatic that Pixar has to make a

168
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,990
movie about him even though his mother

169
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,580
and siblings were murdered and he was

170
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,140
captured and abducted and imprisoned in

171
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,490
a tank leaving his father to have to go

172
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,170
cheese after I'm merely getting him

173
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,290
murdered as well just because he has

174
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,150
such a good personality find Nemo is in

175
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,880
the end isn't that what we're all really

176
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,740
looking for our very own deformed mother

177
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,950
and siblings murdered superstar movie

178
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,750
fish what oh sorry was that getting

179
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,830
weird very and also you're saying that

180
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,810
you want to find your Nemo

181
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:06,010
yeah and you do realize that Nemo is a

182
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:07,120
boy right yeah but the thing you guys

183
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,320
