00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,970
with some random person but in order to

111
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,040
escalate that drama from mean tweets to

112
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,989
a diss track to an actual fight that

113
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,269
people want to see you need the real

114
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,120
stuff you need that passionate loathing

115
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,130
that authentic disdain that only comes

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,050
from two people who just know how to get

117
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,460
under each other's skin and just piss

118
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,950
each other off to the point of hatred

119
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,530

120
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:36,169

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,030
Facebook messages Henry I don't want to

143
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,460
talk to you okay so what's your point

144
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,320
well my point is when you called me

145
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,229
earlier I was literally in the middle of

146
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,150
packing for Europe and I got offered a

147
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:37,830
fight and England I was going over there

148
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,020
and I thought I can't leave without

149
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,789
figuring out what this is what what is

150
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,289
this between us first of all I didn't I

151
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:44,789
trying to call you I don't know when or

152
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:46,050
how you did it but you changed your name

153
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:48,120
in my phone oh that was when you left in

154
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,710
front of the Steamies secondly I don't

155
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,419
know how you of all people got a fight

156
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,610
but I don't care so if you came here to

157
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,139
just rub it in my face oh no no no no

158
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,490
that's not it at all and what are you

159
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:01,639
here for I came here because cuz you're

160
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,110
my dream fight something about you

161
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:09,699
rejecting me over over over

162
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:12,639
over and over and over and over and over

163
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:15,490
it yes over and over a lot of times yes

164
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,110
what again and again it just built up my

165
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,060
hate for you and I won't be able to

166
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,159
focus on this fight in Europe or any

167
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,050
other fight until I get a definite

168
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:28,569
answer from you

169
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:29,949
so once and for all Ryan Anthony he goes

170
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:36,009
not even my middle name will you fight

171
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:37,539
me Alex I don't know how it could have

172
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:39,520
been any more clear than I've been up

173
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,900
into this point wait wait wait I feel

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,190
like I know you're going with this and

175
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,479
before you do Alex

176
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,860
okay I don't know if it's just because

177
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,300
you're stupid and you really can't

178
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,800
understand what I'm saying maybe just

179
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,539
went deaf through your own high-pitched

180
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,810
girly voice but get this through your

181
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:56,110
thick dumb disproportionate dad to a

182
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,639
breeding head I will never ever fight

183
