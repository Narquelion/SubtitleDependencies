where I said the live experience the

98
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,580

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,360
80s right no they're pretty big they're

105
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,360
bigger than BTS they're not bigger than

106
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,729
BTS but as a female group they're huge

107
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,710
yeah hey did you guys know get them I

108
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,960

get us some hate but um did you guys

110
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,490
know that bTW

111
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,900
in Korean means something what does it

112
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,580
mean the Korean Americans I think I

113
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,850
don't know about Korean Koreans what is

114
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,020
this it stands they call BTS actually

115
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,180
stands for some not that not that group

116
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,240
okay when they can't they say after you

117
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,070
know it's just saying in in I don't know

118
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,430
about in Korea but for Korean Americans

119
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,970
BTS means burning Dunkleman syndrome or

120
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,980
something like that

121
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,350
Tong Tong Kamal is it Tong come on I'm

122
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,180
not Korean but I know it's like burning

123
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,590
toe come on sensation or something like

124
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,350
that and that basically means like after

125
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:24,510
you eat spicy food when you get fired No

126
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,510
so BTS actually means like fire poop

127
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,710
probably because they got fire

128
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,300
that's probably the name of one of their

129
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,550
songs fire shoes or something like that

130
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,370
that sounds like a BTS sorry BTS is high

131
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,110
they have so many hardcore fans that

132
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:43,270
like even just now I had to be like man

133
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,950
I should wear this very thing about them

134
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,140
is they have a lot of inspirational

135
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,210
songs that have like good meaning to

136
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,670
their lyrics but their fans how can you

137
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,260
understand it it's it's the lyrics and

138
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,570
like the meanings of stuff and you see

139
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,010
them you haven't translated but a lot

140
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,470
it's weird cuz a lot of times certain

141
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:02,320
parts of their fandom will be way too

142
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,660
aggressive and like not live what

143
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,610
they're praising you know so if they're

144
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,380
saying like yeah peace and unity and

145
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,060
then like their fans are like kind of

146
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:18,040
not doing this yeah that's like most

147
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:21,130
people though cult it's a gold well

148
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,730
alright don't put this on this is does

149
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,500
not reflect the views called I mean

150
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,510
that's theirs isn't that a sane cult

151
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,840
fandom yeah kind of thing so make sense

152
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,310
yeah but they are I mean like I mean

153
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,680
from the moment we had we had BTS

154
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,330
meaning behind the scenes on our second

155
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,070
Channel videos since I don't know how

156
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,140
long and I don't know where or when it

157
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,280
started happening but all these people

158
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,840
and I've just seen it grow over the

159
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,070
years these BTS army fans have been

160
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,150
there since I don't know do you remember

161
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,919
when it started happening I don't

162
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,960
remember exactly but I just kept

163
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,250
thinking yeah you just use all of a

164
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,979
sudden there was all these people say

165
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,860
like BTS army and then at first I

166
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:00,870
thought they met like this yeah I was

167
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,790
like yeah

168
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:06,050
yeah they're representing our behind the

169
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,050
scenes they really care about us

170
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,340
oh no they'd it's it's amazing how far

171
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,850
they've come

172
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:17,310
it's crazy and aren't are they like

173
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,440
considered them like most successful

174
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,000
kpop I would I would say so yeah ever I

175
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,920
would you know what I would at least in

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,050
the US for sure they hit didn't they hit

177
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,060
like one of their first number one like

178
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,140
the first Korean has kpop band to hit

179
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,790
like number one in the billboards or

180
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,430
something but they were also on I think

181
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:37,800
like Time magazine like the front the

182
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:39,660
front page mmm really I can't even I

working on another song yeah yeah you

205
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,980
guys could get a show and have a concert

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,620
and then people could get their tickets

207
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,840
at Sikhi there you go see it your show

208
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,700

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,690

212
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,040
how about you where would I go I would

213
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,450
probably pick a concert honestly I'm

214
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,800
usually not too picky when it comes to

215
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,710
concerts I mean as long as it's like a

216
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,900
music group that I like I'm down you

217
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,820
know or sports like go into a like a fun

218
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,150
sports event go most like support Jeremy

219
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,160
or who sees spurs like I'm down

220
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,950
siegy Jeremy just went over to the

221
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,720
Raptors yeah yep he's uh because you

222
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,000
don't know Jeremy Lynn yeah Jeremy Lynn

223
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,089
just

224
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,620
it wasn't trade he's bought out

225
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:21,019
basically he's on he went from the

226
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,300
Atlanta Hawks who are in the bottom

227
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:26,509
probably five teams in the whole league

228
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,970
to literally like the top maybe like the

229
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,610
top three team so he legit has a chance

230
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,899
to win a ring not likely because the

231
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,449
Golden State's always going to be the

232
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:38,829
favorite but God we got I don't know

233
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,829
don't get me going on basketball

234
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,800
basketball

235
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:45,259
nobody cares about basketball whose

236
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,810
leaves you grabbing in basketball we're

237
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:49,399
gonna do a side podcast of Ryan in

238
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,839
support I know I want to do like a

239
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,180
sports podcast so there's this um

240
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,560
there's this player on the raptors

241
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,240
actually Danny Green who has a podcast

242
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,569
called the green room I think he has a

243
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,819
podcast yeah gangrena so oh but I mean

244
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:05,180
I'm a fan because you know he's uh he

245
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:08,569
was a spur yeah one of my favorite Spurs

246
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,639
but he got traded within the whole Kawhi

247
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:11,870
Leonard trade again I think I don't know

248
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,370
if we should stand the topic of

249
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,439
basketball but basically has a he has a

250
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,800
podcast and I would definitely be dumb

251
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:19,819
and if he's down Danny Green actually

252
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,500

hobbies are my hobby

318
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:02,660
pretty much like there was one time

319
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,910
where I kind of got into this tabletop

320
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,820
game called Warhammer and was basically

321
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,850
like models and painting and it just

322
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,250
like it put together a lot of things

323
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,870
that I like to do so like models and

324
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,990
then I also like playing word games and

325
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,420
I also like painting so it was like very

326
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,340
easy for me to be like man I want to

327
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,930
like get into it and I had fun doing it

328
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,820
I kind of stopped for a little bit cuz

329
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,820
it's a lot of money in time and and

330
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,770
stuff but and then I got into board

331
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:35,180
games and if I collected tabletop board

332
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:36,890
games computer games any other games you

333
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,270
can add that list so pretty much we're

334
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,400
just a bunch of because popular yours

335
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,340
you play video games that's like -

336
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,750
alright

337
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,640
yeah much it's like almost like a

338
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,190
borderline addiction I think especially

339
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,530
for you yeah cuz you will sacrifice your

340
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,000
sleep like even come into work and be

341
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,020
like oh you didn't sleep for like you

342
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,700
only set up a couple hours cuz you're

343
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,010
playing video games that night til

344
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,270
however a.m. in the morning sleep a

345
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,670
little bit and you wake up and play

346
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:04,160
games before you come in and like you

347
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:06,690
just look exhausted yeah that's nice

348
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,030
because you know that you you know that

349
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,590
yeah there's now I got Deven like I mean

350
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:14,190
it it's true you have like an addiction

351
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,630
to gaming yeah I mean like okay so Ryan

352
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,640
has always said like oh you have an

353
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,960
addictive personality which is like I

354
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:23,940
get addicted to things very quickly yes

355
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:28,110
like things that easily interest me I

356
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,450
will just dive into very hard and I just

357
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,740
go through like little seasons of habit

358
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,250
so kind of like you like having hobbies

359
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,870
yeah but I go to the extent of not

360
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:39,330
eating or sleeping sometimes just

361
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,240
learning about these do you guys I mean

362
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,860
have you that's a good that's also not

363
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,210
necessarily a horrible quality some

364
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,520
people with addictive personalities

365
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,140
actually become you know some of the

366
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,580
best athletes some of the best like

367
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,770
because if you're spending that much

368
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,850
time on something you're bound to be

369
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,830
good at it you know if you're gonna

370
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,630
spend that much of your time

371
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,610
investing in like studying and figuring

372
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,040
out how you're gonna be better at

373
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,260
whatever it is like I mean that's how

374
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,000
you become good right like yeah you kind

375
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,040
of have to be an addict to a certain

376
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,010
degree yeah but I think I could spend my

377
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,510
time on a lot better things yeah you

378
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,920
could but I'm just saying like people

379
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,960
with addictive personalities if you

380
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,000
think about it like Michael Phelps he's

381
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,040
probably addicted to swimming you know

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,700
like he's probably can't focuses on oh

383
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,080
how can I become a faster swimmer or how

384
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,370
should I train and same thing with any

385
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,410
every basketball player I'm sure they

386
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,760
watch tape on themselves like people

387
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,950
with addictive personalities are

388
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,450
actually the people who succeed usually

389
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,790
yeah I can't think of many people who

390
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,690
are completely successful who aren't

391
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,820
that kind of personality

392
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,470
so because you're successful in making

393
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,410
videos would you say that you were

394
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:46,410
addicted to making videos or making

395
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:49,200
people laugh or what made you grab onto

396
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,870
YouTube very very late with with your

397
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,540
whole life I guess I mean I think I was

398
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,170
um it also changes a lot I think you

399
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,670
have to be a dick

400
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:01,860
did for me I was addicted to the fact of

401
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,959
trying to create things that I couldn't

402
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,130
do in the past they create new things

403
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:09,050
and try and create things that are

404
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:11,130
different and then it's very it's very

405
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:14,579
unsatisfying when I have to settle for

406
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,959
something that's not something new even

407
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,940
if it does well even if I create a video

408
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,250
that does really well it's sometimes

409
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,110
super unsatisfying for me because it's

410
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,449
just like man I already did a video like

411
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,089
this or I already did this joke but in a

412
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:29,040
different way it's not unique you know

413
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:31,050
so like what videos would those be a

414
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,839
video that did well that I didn't that

415
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:37,500
you weren't unsatisfied I mean there's a

416
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,180
lot and there's videos that I kind of

417
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,310
even go through all of them but just the

418
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,920
one that's sticking out right now one

419
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:46,649
that sticks out that did well yeah that

420
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,100
I am not necessarily proud of like was

421
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:51,449
it fortnight or in a fortnight we did

422
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,550
some new things and then which I was

423
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:55,320
like kind of happy about I would say

424
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:59,490
probably something along the lines of

425
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:02,550
like a evenly like when we did the how

426
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:05,339
to be ninja - mmm it's like it's kind of

427
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,199
a parody of a parody and it was just

428
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,339
like oh well you know what it was fun

429
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,970
because we did the fighting thing and

430
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,100
that was different

431
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:14,760
yeah but the rest of it was just like an

432
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,439
ecstatic my excuse to kind of uh do

433
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,480
something different by using something

434
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,160
that's not if that makes sense yeah yeah

435
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,510
yeah so it was my it was my wig I

436
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,730
literally all I want to do is do that

437
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,640
fight scene so I wrote the entire script

438
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,530
that'd be just good enough not great

439
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,870
the whole rest of is not it's not good

440
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,640
it's just like basic like jokes they're

441
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,679
not to me at least it's not the most

442
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,390
creative thing in the world but I was

443
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,429
very satisfied and I was happy with it

444
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,750
because of the end scene because it was

445
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:41,340
we didn't do anything like that we never

446
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,820
did an action sequence like that

447
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,970
so I mean that's my version I guess yeah

448
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,190
I would say probably it's it's probably

449
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,890
safe to assume that if there's any kind

450
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,620
of like cinematic qualities you're

451
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,390
usually pushing for like that's usually

452
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,490
you trying to push it into like a new

453
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,530
realm of like making it higher quality

454
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,940
and then if it's like a list or like

455
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,520
something where it's like more flog

456
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:09,510
heavy that's probably something you're

457
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,960
less likely to be satisfied with right

458
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,760
yeah no I mean it's just like I use I I

459
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,000
mean especially before I used to use

460
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,920
these videos to like sneak in things so

461
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,380
if I wanted to act more I would put in a

462
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,800
scene where it has to be more dependent

463
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,850
on acting versus just straight-up jokes

464
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,380
but then I but then obviously those

465
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,910
don't usually do as well cuz it's it's

466
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,490
not what people are used to it and what

467
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,840
they want right you just want the same

468
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,060
specific format for the most part I mean

469
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,820
whether they they I don't know people

470
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,440
were listening agree or not it reflects

471
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:44,010
in the numbers yeah it's always show and

472
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,360
the likes and dislike ratio so and then

473
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,730
despite what people say that's that's

474
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:54,900
just how it is alright proof is in the

475
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:57,720
pudding because I feel like we said that

476
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:02,790
last time no no see I remember reference

477
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,800
is hobbies so your hobby is gaming right

478
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,750
yeah and that's it pretty much like

479
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,590
that's your main hobby huh oh and video

480
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,870
making that's I just like my main

481
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,940
hobbies making people laugh so stand up

482
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,800
yeah just any form of comedy I just like

483
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,200
that not so much making videos making

484
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,510
videos is just a way to make people

485
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,700
laugh right right so let's talk about

486
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,200
this new hobby you both have been into

487
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,190
the fishing you've been trying to know

488
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,670
who's fishing is great no it's not you

489
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,260
missed out that's when Sean was here I

490
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,720
was talking about that game you keep

491
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:41,210
trying to get me to play a pape X yeah

492
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,210
I'm not even a fan of it you're never

493
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,780
supporter

494
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,090
like anything that becomes popular if he

495
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,560
was if if we weren't into apex or if

496
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,240
nobody was really into it you'd be like

497
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,100
this game so dope you guys gotta try it

498
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,800
but the moment it becomes popular he's

499
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,180
like not even about that dude I remember

500
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,560
when we were in for tonight was getting

501
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,080
big and I was telling me I was like hey

502
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,940
this game he was into pub G cuz I was

503
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,270
like the you know less popular one in

504
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,470
the original and I stopped playing for G

505
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:11,340
because I was playing for tonight this

506
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:13,020
is years ago more than oh you did

507
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,210
because I said they're coming out with a

508
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,800
game oh yeah but you didn't play it but

509
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,360
you were you refused you're like oh

510
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,390
you're one of those you play for tonight

511
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,100
and then

512
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,540
wasn't few months later he's just the

513
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,940
guy playing more for tonight than I ever

514
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,890
played and he's just like and he was the

515
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,480
one telling me oh wow you're playing for

516
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,060
tonight I'm a pub chief I play real

517
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,000
games yeah it was a better game

518
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,950
Mogi yeah well not in terms of numbers I

519
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,350
don't think it is you are like that

520
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,240
though yeah I would say so it's a quote

521
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,250
it's not a bad call it's just funny that

522
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,440
it's like it is if someone if someone

523
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,410
tells you dude you gonna watch this show

524
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,320
this show is is amazing like I love the

525
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,430
show you your first reaction is like all

526
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,200
right whatever and then you watching

527
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,840
you're like what's cool even if in the

528
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,640
back of your head you're like no no no

529
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,080
no no not true at all I don't think I

530
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,210
think it actually makes him believe that

531
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,650
it isn't good when it when it could be

532
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,400
because he sets himself up for

533
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,430
expectations

534
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,230
yeah there's but you know what there's a

535
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,210
lot of people like that and that is like

536
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,400
the hipster mentality and it makes me

537
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,650
curious like what looks like let's break

538
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,820
this down a little bit let's go inside

539
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,700
the mind of Paco

540
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,650
Wyatt what makes you you know you you're

541
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,710
aware and you acknowledge acknowledge

542
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:28,600
that that's how you think so why do you

543
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:32,300
know why or well for me a lot of it is

544
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,310
like there's a it's like you know how

545
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,070
you said like a general audience will

546
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:39,890
like a certain thing and it's not

547
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,620
necessarily the smartest or the funniest

548
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,210
or the most well thought out and so

549
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,460
that's where I'm coming from

550
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,570
well I'm like okay this may be good to a

551
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,750
larger audience

552
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:52,280
sure but does it do I like it or am I

553
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,090
gonna like it because other people are

554
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:58,340
like you like apex no I don't don't lie

555
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,490
no I after I played it a couple of times

556
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:04,670
I was like oh it's just in another B are

557
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:06,470
you like it no reason why I don't like

558
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,840
it is because it's it's very fast-paced

559
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,370
similar black ops and that's why I liked

560
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,290
pub G cuz it was slower is more

561
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,940
thought-out yeah you know there's no

562
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,860
there's other ways that you can see that

563
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,780
yeah okay I guess so I don't know that's

564
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,820
like for tonight for tonight's a kind of

565
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,590
a faster pace in pub but it's it's it's

566
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,080
it's it's faster than pub G but it's

567
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,720
slower than black ops in Apex yeah I

568
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,670
guess so so I have the ability to still

569
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,380
try and think my way out of situation

570
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:33,020
here yeah okay

571
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,110
yeah well well for that specific

572
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:38,900
I get that but I mean you like you said

573
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:41,120
you acknowledge that that's a quality of

574
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,040
you yeah yeah yeah and I'm still trying

575
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,570
to figure out the root of that I think

576
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,070
it's something a lot cuz we know I know

577
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,540
a lot of people like that it's not just

578
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,550
you know yeah I mean that's what a

579
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,740
hipster is right it's that that's like

580
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,270
the stereo just want ya the stereotype

581
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,360
stereotypical hipster right right

582
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:58,130
somebody who wants to be different from

583
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,570
the mainstream sure I don't know if

584
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,670
that's a good definition they don't want

585
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,170
to be caught liking what's hot or like

586
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,700
yeah I mean that's like I don't know

587
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,620
what the technical term I don't wanna

588
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,240
offend people I know I told Greg once

589
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:12,170
that he was a hipster not knowing it was

590
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,760
a bad thing and it's cuz he has a

591
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,200
mustache and you know he had like you

592
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,060
would wear like overalls and stuff like

593
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,990
I don't think he mean was just drinking

594
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,490
so I don't know it sure I didn't mean it

595
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,200
like you know make it was at the time it

596
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,700
wasn't a negative thing yeah I think I

597
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,980
was just oh it's like a hipster thing I

598
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,480
was living in LA and you know we were

599
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,070
drinking all these jar things I was like

600
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,720
oh yeah Greg's pretty hipster and I

601
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,360
think he got legit offended wasn't a

602
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,790
mason jar I don't know we were like I'm

603
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,620
one of those typical LA places with like

604
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,600
a jar where they put water I just want a

605
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,580
cup I don't want a jar loom you know I

606
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,740
mean yeah and that's pretty hipster it

607
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:51,800
is it is yeah Jason jar Oh anyway um I

608
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:54,860
was it makes me think like I kind of I

609
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,570
get that but like what makes somebody

610
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,730
like that is the fact that they're

611
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,380
insecure about the fact that they need

612
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,880
to be different or is it because they

613
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,500
feel like they need to be it's cooler to

614
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,560
not be hmm

615
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,810
similar cuz everybody wants alright this

616
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,910
is my thought process as to why I'm like

617
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:13,250
that and it's just because I was always

618
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,170
kind of different and I was seen as

619
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,480
different and that's almost my identity

620
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,830
and so because for my whole life I've

621
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,020
been different and I like different

622
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:24,190
things right there's no reason for me to

623
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,780
like normal stuff seep no but see I'm I

624
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,030
grew up very different too you know i'm

625
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,680
i think is my insecurities and my the

626
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,260
way i coped with it is the opposite that

627
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:36,020
i would try to fit in so it was much

628
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,460
less cool with that but this is because

629
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,290
I'm a stronger person than you thought

630
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:43,060
yeah different that is probably exactly

631
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,060
why all right arm wrestle

632
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,100
I don't want to beat him so here's a

633
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:50,770
question for you then if it was uncool

634
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,380
to be different back in the day and now

635
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:56,050
it's cool to be different are you gonna

636
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,690
be not different you got me Andy

637
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:01,900
catch-22 is it mean that much to you

638
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:05,050
would you like flip-flop no I think for

639
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,240
me is just that make sense you know

640
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,510
because it's like I get what you're

641
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,360
saying

642
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:12,930
yeah but I think for me I'm gonna do

643
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,060
what I find interesting in what I like

644
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:18,640
no but but we're saying is sometimes

645
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,050
what you find interesting is affected by

646
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,930
what everyone else finds interesting

647
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,430
yeah hmm and that's the web part I wanna

648
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:28,510
figure out it's not even like if there

649
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:30,340
was a vortex more like a a a world

650
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,840
universe where you're literally just by

651
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,610
yourself you have all these different

652
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,990
routes and choices you can make like oh

653
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,210
I want to be into this gate I wanna do

654
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,830
this hobby you would probably pick

655
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,840
something completely your route your

656
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,950
tree your route tree would be completely

657
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:48,430
different from what it is in this

658
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:50,500
reality I think you've heavily in

659
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:53,260
affected by what other people think yes

660
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,290
and no because if I like something like

661
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:59,320
yes pub she was very popular it was it

662
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:01,540
was it was I was still like it's true oh

663
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,460
I really like this game and I stuck with

664
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:05,800
it I played it a lot so if I do like it

665
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,360
what is popular I will stick with it but

666
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,670
when fortnight got popular and I told

667
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,610
you to hop on it yeah what did you tell

668
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:15,130
me I was like Oh gross yeah though is a

669
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:17,260
little kid who plays portney that's your

670
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,940
reaction like you're in like natural

671
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,320
yeah yeah because it was at the time

672
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,300
when I told it to him I was like dude

673
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,020
it's bigger it's bigger than pub G like

674
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,460
way bigger

675
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,690
why don't you just play this it's so

676
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,320
like there's a reason why people are

677
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:33,160
playing it hmm see I I think I'm very I

678
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,840
get that mentality but I am uh I guess I

679
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,720
was just a little some nerd trying to

680
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,190
fit in you know yeah cuz you liked it

681
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,500
and you were like all this game six oh

682
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,390
yeah and especially the for the fact

683
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,650
that people are playing it like you know

684
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,240
even more some but like okay I want to

685
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,660
be in you know and be way in with the

686
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,660
cool kids

687
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:55,549
it's yeah I don't I I can't do that

688
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,409
stuff so well regardless I think Ryan

689
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:59,509
would probably like apex because he

690
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:02,269
likes black ops anyway yeah for the

691
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:04,759
people who don't have context to why I

692
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:06,440
brought this up yeah will has every for

693
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:08,239
every shoot has been trying to pitch me

694
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,599
to play this game yeah and it's not

695
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:13,190
about me not trying to fit in because I

696
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,979
know what the games getting big yeah

697
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:18,409
huge this season thing is this I'm so

698
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:20,450
different I'm such a bad way like if it

699
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:23,059
gets big in about probably jump on the

700
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,229
opposite of Paco because you see like oh

701
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:25,369
there's a lot of people playing so you

702
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:26,599
see the value yeah and I should probably

703
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:28,519
learn about it yeah

704
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:30,649
like even just for YouTube but I think

705
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,940
I'm pretty good at seeing a game and

706
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,499
being like oh I think Ryan would like

707
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,169
this cuz I know what kind of plate likes

708
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:38,090
play style you like and I remember

709
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:40,190
seeing fortnight a long long long time

710
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,419
ago and the reason why I said to you

711
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,729
even before it came out they were

712
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:45,349
working on like their tower defense

713
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:47,299
version to the single-player and I was

714
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:49,249
like Ryan this game is for you like we

715
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:50,570
got like we gotta play this and you like

716
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:52,669
you actually probably like that mode

717
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,820
better huh yeah I mean I I personally do

718
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,440
I like games that you um not just games

719
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,820
I just like things where you if you're

720
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,979
working on something if you don't put

721
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,019
time and effort into it that you keep

722
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:06,049
keep that status or like you keep

723
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:08,210
growing within I am not as big of a fan

724
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:11,239
of something that you just play and then

725
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,979
you start over yeah yeah that make sense

726
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:14,989
um just because I feel like it's a it's

727
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:16,820
not worth the time yeah you know what

728
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:17,799
they're not a sponsor of this point no

729
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,320

738
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:39,769

00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:50,050

that's the money real what you just got

747
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,590
paid that's like a fishing reel I don't

748
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,700
know if I'm supposed to read the same

749
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,370
thing twice

750
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,660
but we have been bringing up Sikhi Kola

751
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,490
I don't think we normally have to do

752
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,760
this but I'm just gonna bring it up

753
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,710
again

754
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,810
just a reminder in case for whatever

755
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,040
reason you jump ahead to the if you're

756
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,410
one of the people who just jump ahead of

757
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,240
the shishu break I will say that when

758
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,490
after our she she breaks I think our

759
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,630
podcast get better I think so too I

760
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,700
think it's because we're warmed up and

761
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:38,180
we're talking like normal anyway back to

762
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,550

Sunday yes I just I guess yesterday

934
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:17,180
technically it would be hope specific

935
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:19,460

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,349
that I just released that I am dating

937
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:31,369
Arden which most people had already

938
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:33,170
known do claps thanks yeah

939
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,989
we have we've been dating for a long

940
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:39,049
time yeah Oh while yeah I mean it's

941
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:42,980
things we never said we're gonna hide it

942
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:45,200
per se but um we just didn't we didn't

943
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,420
feel the necessary to announce it we

944
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,739
don't want to make it like one of those

945
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,749
channels where they just make their

946
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,369
things about the relationships yeah I

947
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:54,829
mean it becomes like messy I think it

948
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:57,200
becomes like it puts a strain a

949
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:58,369
different unnecessary pressure yeah on

950
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,009
the relationship makes sense and you

951
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:03,950
guys it means your own private life I

952
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:05,779
mean yeah to a certain extent but anyway

953
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,369
did yeah we didn't try to hide it but we

954
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:08,660
just didn't announce it yeah a lot of

955
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:10,579
people already knew yeah

956
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,859

it that I actually feel pretty exhausted

1044
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:15,920
yeah we went a little bit long I feel

1045
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,359
bad about this podcast like we I don't

1046
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,869
even remember what we talked about to be

1047
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,780
honest I had its moments it had four

1048
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:26,810
energy drinks today and that's God above

1049
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:28,010
my limit oh I almost forgot

1050
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,820
I was gonna bring up the other story

1051
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,070
about when we were talking about

1052
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,349
Indonesia and a funny story about that

1053
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:36,650
and um I don't think I've ever said this

1054
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:40,190
publicly but uh apparently at that show

1055
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:43,310
I met rich chigga oh really he was at

1056
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:45,200

1058
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,400
with him

1059
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:50,810
he sent it to me and he's like crazy huh

1060
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,810

1061
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:56,690
oh yeah rich Bryan is it racist to see

1062
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:59,180

1063
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:02,030
make that up like okay well people know

1064
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,190

1066
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:12,950
that's awfully similar no but yeah he

1067
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,510
sent me a DM I don't think he cares that

1068
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,010
I'm saying this anyway but he sent me a

1069
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,530
DM I'll just like because I guess I was

1070
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,910
following him this is after that big his

1071
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,520
first big song when he was wearing the

1072
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,630
polo with the pink polo hmm that that

1073
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,369

must have been somebody a part of that

1092
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:07,130
you know behind the scenes it's a crew

1093
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:09,109
people so yeah anyway that's what it's

1094
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,339
only because we were talking about yeah

1095
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:15,880
you know why because everybody likes it

1096
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:18,079
that's what you it's off mate um okay

00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,260
speaking of Valentine's Day and you

1098
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:24,140
probably like the person you're with

1099
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:26,690
segue we got a topic here that I

1100
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:29,290
actually do like well you did like read

1101
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:35,060
it Paco hit me with it

1102
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:38,030
it literally says can you like Oh guys

1103
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:39,859
we're so tired anyway this is a good

1104
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:42,560
topic I wanted to talk about this

1105
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:45,050
alright well the topic is uh is it

1106
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,390
possible can you like someone's art even

1107
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:49,460
if you don't like the artist like for

1108
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,560
instance the whole r.kelly situation

1109
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,859
which is going on right now there have

1110
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:59,990
been many documentaries articles you

1111
00:43:54,859 --> 00:44:03,050
know exposing how he had harassed and

1112
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:06,410
abused people sexually many of which

1113
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:08,300
were underage mm-hmm and a lot of people

1114
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,520
are calling for artists who have

1115
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:15,020
collaborated with him to call him out on

1116
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:17,870
that so is it possible that you can

1117
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:20,000
define the person as he admitted to this

1118
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,740
I'm not too sure yet or like been proven

1119
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,330
it's hard to say because I also like

1120
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:25,220
what if we find out I mean obviously I'm

1121
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,290
not trying to defend him yeah and it

1122
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,120
seems a consensus that it's true yeah

1123
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:31,640
what if we find out later down the road

1124
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,410
like holy crap we were wrong and then we

1125
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,360
start adding I think they have physical

1126
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,190
evidence of some okay so that hasn't

1127
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,540
been proven then yeah but there's so

1128
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:40,610
many different cases you can think of

1129
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,980
like how do you know do you still like

1130
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:45,740
watching The Cosby Show do you still

1131
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,390
like maybe an actor even if they have

1132
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,570
like different political views like yeah

1133
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:53,360
or movies that were created by Weinstein

1134
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:55,310
yes like a ton of great movie exactly I

1135
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,560
when I read this it was something I had

1136
00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:00,260
thought about before I kind of see some

1137
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,850
most people from what I read at least

1138
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,500
and not that I've seen the document I

1139
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:05,060
haven't seen a document me neither and I

1140
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,770
don't know if they're completely true

1141
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,180
I'm assuming that they are but I don't

1142
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:11,120
want to I'm not gonna say that they are

1143
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,560
or not because I don't know but from

1144
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,780
what I've read from what people wrote

1145
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,070
like you know I have friends on Facebook

1146
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,970
Twitter and stuff like that they're all

1147
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:21,740
like it's your I don't care if you like

1148
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:24,020
the song I used to like it's tough you

1149
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,850
can't support it the consensus is like

1150
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,770
you can't like the you can't like the

1151
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,870
art if the artist is like that but I

1152
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:31,550
don't completely agree with it I think

1153
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:33,260
I'm in the same boat as he actually yeah

1154
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:35,750
but moat you beat I think people are

1155
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:39,290
gonna be very upset about hearing Obama

1156
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:41,180
saying that but I feel like I mean the

1157
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:43,160
reason why I liked I get not supporting

1158
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,410
them like not buying certain exactly I

1159
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:49,190
get that but like it's something that is

1160
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:51,800
pleasurable to you like in your ears or

1161
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:53,600
in visually like you can't help but feel

1162
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,850
a certain way about something yeah you

1163
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:58,700
know you're not trying to you don't like

1164
00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:01,010
him because of our Kelly the person it's

1165
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,740
it's just good good content its whatever

1166
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:05,690
he's crazy but like even in the wine see

1167
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,310
thing what are some movies that Harvey

1168
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,960
said his name Harvey Weinstein you're

1169
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:12,200
lying so what movies that he's created

1170
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,970
so many big movies um and like really or

1171
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,100
not just him but he's a part of so many

1172
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,090
big movies in like I can't just all of a

1173
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,890
sudden that I found out he's this

1174
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:20,660
horrible person that you know I can't

1175
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:22,490
say oh I hated I hate them when I'm not

1176
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:25,010
gonna I understand not supporting it but

1177
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:27,260
like you already have supported right

1178
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:29,450
right um I guess it's different with

1179
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:31,430
movies but like well I think I mean I

1180
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:34,510
think it's pretty similar

1181
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:37,130
like you said it comes down to obviously

1182
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,410
there's a difference between continually

1183
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,690
or continuing to support the artists in

1184
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:45,109
terms of like buying the songs or going

1185
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:48,289
to the concerts or whatever but in terms

1186
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:50,630
of a song existing and you listening to

1187
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:52,490
it and being like oh I still like the

1188
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,970
song like it's I think that's probably I

1189
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:58,609
think that's okay I think you know so I

1190
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:01,430
have the solution to it you do yeah

1191
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:04,309
so if you don't like the artists but you

1192
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:07,579
do like the art what you can do pirate

1193
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:10,849
exactly download it illegally you don't

1194
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:13,430
support them strew and you still get to

1195
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:15,410
experience the pleasure and this sea but

1196
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:18,829
people already say you shouldn't be

1197
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:20,210
enjoying their art Kelly's music well I

1198
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:21,890
don't know about other like I don't know

1199
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,619
if with me like movies and stuff like

1200
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:25,910
that but I've read like I had to stop

1201
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:28,880
list I completely stopped listening to

1202
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:30,859
our Kelly I deleted all my songs with

1203
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,470
our Kelly it's even artists I'm say I

1204
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:36,230
took off you know people who

1205
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:38,200
collaborated with him said I took off I

1206
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:41,720
don't know what they took it off eBay

1207
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,549
Spotify or iTunes like I took my songs

1208
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,230
off who was it there's a few celebrities

1209
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:48,680
that did that I singers I think there's

1210
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,549
one main one I was a tailor so not too

1211
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,619
sure mm-hmm

1212
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:52,869
it might no not tailors I know what it

1213
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:55,789
makes sense why would he be working with

1214
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:59,720
Johnny she was a little kid when he was

1215
00:47:55,789 --> 00:48:02,859
popular that's why off the pill another

1216
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:05,180
one that's kind of like this is help

1217
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:08,839
what's his name Chris Pratt is getting

1218
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:11,630
kind of like flak Wow because he was

1219
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:14,690
I forgot what talk-show he was on he was

1220
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:17,059
talking about how he's with a church or

1221
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:22,220
like an organization and that church is

1222
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:24,710
kind of in line with like anti-gay I see

1223
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,510
and so though he was getting like flack

1224
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:28,130
for that and like a lot of people and

1225
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:32,059
that I kind of thought of that when I

1226
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:35,299
heard that because then it's like do you

1227
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:37,220
not like his movies anymore or like any

1228
00:48:35,299 --> 00:48:39,020
of the movies who's associated with or

1229
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,180
you know I mean like that's kind of in

1230
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:43,940
line I think a little bit where trust is

1231
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,810
like they'd they you can still maybe

1232
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,120
like it

1233
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:49,760
this is why I think you can like it but

1234
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:52,000
what the trance is like you can't watch

1235
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,740
it anymore

1236
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,390
cuz you can't control what you like but

1237
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,380
you can control what you watch you think

1238
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,790
that's what they're saying or that's

1239
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,050
what you're saying no I mean I think

1240
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,730
that's that's what they're saying I

1241
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,710
think it's okay to still watch it to be

1242
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,810
honest and I think I still I'm never

1243
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:08,349
gonna buy another r.kelly song yeah that

1244
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:09,849
I really buy songs anymore but if like a

1245
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:11,500
certain song comes on and I don't even

1246
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:14,619
the thing is I don't even know sometimes

1247
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,180
oh our Kelly sings this like okay that

1248
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:19,270
doesn't change how I feel about the song

1249
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:22,000
yeah it may be like in in playing it out

1250
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:23,859
loud then I'd be like be careful why I

1251
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,680
played around but like I if I didn't

1252
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:28,810
know like it doesn't change based on

1253
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,220
what that person is for me at least I

1254
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,410
don't support artists in the same way I

1255
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:34,900
go by the song it's like are you kind of

1256
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:36,369
coming at it from or agree with us in

1257
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,340
the sense of like you can support an

1258
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:41,349
artist without a green with them on

1259
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,520
certain things you can like the art you

1260
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:44,349
don't necessarily up there like the

1261
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,690
artist right yeah I agree with that you

1262
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:48,760
do 100 we need someone to be politically

1263
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:52,150
correct here so I'm gonna say you guys

1264
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:54,700

1270
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:07,900
can't like it your habit you can't Space

1271
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,820
Jam is one of the greatest movies of all

1272
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,440
time you can't think about it and they

1273
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,320
have I believe I can fly in there

1274
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,460
that is true oh speaking of which I

1275
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,170
don't know if you guys know this or not

1276
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,930
I think I told you already but did you

1277
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:22,270
know he says suck mod he does he says

1278
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:24,820
yeah it's subliminal I'm pretty sure

1279
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:28,300
it's a true thing it's like in the

1280
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:32,280
enemy's like yelling like flying that

1281
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:34,950
thing is run he goes woo segment no

1282
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:43,420
listen to it again

1283
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:47,650
you're trying to get me anyway yeah that

1284
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:51,700
it's it's an even connect that too he he

1285
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:53,710
did it don't assume you know you know

1286
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,680
what no it's all adding up he's doing

1287
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:58,540
putting subliminal messages thing about

1288
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,650
that is a lot of artists put subliminal

1289
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:03,710
messages and you are one

1290
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:06,590
I have some subliminal things in my some

1291
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:08,000
of my songs a lot of your songs yeah but

1292
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,100
it's just for fun just for like me and

1293
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,090
David mmm I just tell you guys about it

1294
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,590
after the fact

1295
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,600
people can go listen to it if they find

1296
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:16,640
it great but I don't care basically what

1297
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,290
happens is listen to song everybody goes

1298
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,440
hey I said this right here and then it

1299
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:23,750
says it and I go it's either like really

1300
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,430
quietly or it's like played like like

1301
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:28,340
behind something kind of like the

1302
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:30,470
r.kelly thing it's not saying suck my

1303
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,660
yeah that's saying that so this is the

1304
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:34,430
other extreme of it right so can you

1305
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:39,770
like someone's art even if you don't

1306
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:44,240
like the artist is there a threshold to

1307
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:46,850
where if there's so so bad of a person

1308
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,060
will it stop you from listening and

1309
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,230
supporting like huh like Hitler Hitler

1310
00:51:50,060 --> 00:52:05,150
made mo Baba

1311
00:51:51,230 --> 00:52:07,940
if Hitler made the most fire hits Hitler

1312
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:11,120
made the best hit and then you found out

1313
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:12,890
like who Hitler was right like say he

1314
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,390
didn't know would you listen to his

1315
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:19,190
music or would you be like okay that's

1316
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:20,900
too far right if he made the most and it

1317
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:23,360
was like iconic right and it was another

1318
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,760
yeah okay well I mean honestly I'm not

1319
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,040
comparing our hey she's not your fault

1320
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,230
if you didn't know and you'd like the

1321
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,210
song it's not your fault but I don't

1322
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,890
think you should be buying it or

1323
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:35,510
supporting the artists in the same it's

1324
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,370
the same things like it still sticks to

1325
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:39,500
it I don't think you should be I mean I

1326
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:42,620
personally am NOT gonna go out of my way

1327
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:44,420
to listen to an hour kill a song right

1328
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,100
it doesn't help his case it doesn't mean

1329
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,390
I don't like his previous songs cuz I

1330
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,920
didn't know that about him when I heard

1331
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:51,200
it and like liked the song it's like

1332
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,760
nostalgia for us yeah I think for me you

1333
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,230
know a lot of those songs like even like

1334
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,660
in the Space Jam when I believe I can

1335
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:59,800
fly is that the title yeah or something

1336
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:01,400
like that hey that's what sing it no

1337
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:05,990
seriously so sorry

1338
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:07,550
yeah anyway I forgot to say PC news of

1339
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:12,410
the week this is kind of peace eNOS

1340
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:14,480
right yeah the week that was the outro

1341
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:17,500
it's pretty good yeah anyway

1342
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:20,540
moving on we're about to move on to

1343
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,220
Twitter questions actually yes we got to

1344
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,530
finish let's finish it up with some yeah

1345
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:27,500
so we have a Twitter account you can

1346
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:29,720
follow it off the pill at off the pill

1347
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:32,000
head off the pill yeah and one of the

1348
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,410
questions Graham to Instagram is off the

1349
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,690
pill podcast so I believe yes on

1350
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:38,510
Instagram yeah and one of the questions

1351
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:40,609
for the Twitter was how do you become

1352
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:42,410
motivated when you're in a rut and you

1353
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:43,790
don't want to do anything and I think

1354
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:45,530
that's a great question especially for

1355
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:47,750
Ryan because pretty much all of last

1356
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:50,180
year he was in a rut I think yeah I'm

1357
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:52,040
dude what'd you get roasted dude I think

1358
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:55,910
that's a very rude thing to say but that

1359
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:58,550
is a good question yeah well I mean I

1360
00:53:55,910 --> 00:54:01,730
think I mean I did talk about it and

1361
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:03,140
that was it this year or the last you

1362
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:07,040
know this year the first one the first

1363
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:09,530
video yeah what's different but goes

1364
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,530
back to what we were talking about

1365
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:15,440
earlier as well of like me deciding to

1366
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:16,670
do things that I want to do like this

1367
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,680
podcast like it's like something I would

1368
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,119
have never posted and I already knew

1369
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,859
like the views we're gonna drop and

1370
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:23,599
obviously they did but you know it's

1371
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:26,000
because it's long-form content and it's

1372
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,640
not necessarily what people come here to

1373
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,740
see sure but it's something that I've

1374
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:35,300
always been wanting to do and I'm I I

1375
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:38,180
have fun doing and I think for me it's

1376
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,310
rediscovering why I did YouTube in the

1377
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,240
first place and that was to have fun

1378
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:43,130
creating new things and doing things

1379
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,560
that are different that I'm not getting

1380
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:47,210
tired of yeah and for me it's I think

1381
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,700
when you're in a rut in anyway you got

1382
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:51,970
to figure out why and I think if you

1383
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,650
really look at yourself and be like okay

1384
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:56,540
this is you're in a rut for what reason

1385
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:58,849
I don't know if it's gonna if this is

1386
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:00,290
the same scenario for this person but at

1387
00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:02,990
least for me come from my perspective

1388
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:07,190
you have to I think you have to get to a

1389
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:11,599
certain point where you feel like you

1390
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:13,670
feel so stuck that you have to you have

1391
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,500
no choice but to kind kind of look at

1392
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:16,310
yourself and come up with why you're

1393
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,560
there yeah

1394
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:20,930
in general a general rule that I always

1395
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,140
is always ask why for everything asking

1396
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:26,270
why has helped me in every aspect of

1397
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,430
life yeah whether like if someone's

1398
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:30,950
being mean to you don't don't

1399
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:33,529
be sad about it don't cry don't while

1400
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:35,000
you guess you could cry but you give me

1401
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:37,760
sad you can be sad it as well but I'm

1402
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,400
just so if you ask yourself why when I

1403
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,260
was getting bullied and I hated it I

1404
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,299
hated life I had to ask why and that

1405
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,220
helped me it was like okay what he's

1406
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:49,130
doing it because you know he wants to

1407
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:50,569
make people laugh why because you know

1408
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:53,869
maybe he doesn't at the time wasn't

1409
00:55:50,569 --> 00:55:55,880
think this but later because that person

1410
00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:59,690
probably gets enjoyment

1411
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,940
it makes him popular so by thinking that

1412
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,680
way you find solutions like well okay if

1413
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,480
that's what he wants and that's what I

1414
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,720
want how can I do that how can I make

1415
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,579
people laugh or how can i you know if

1416
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,950
that's what if that's what he wants then

1417
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:14,240
I should know it's not about me you know

1418
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:15,799
I mean that well that's one that's one

1419
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,039
example but asking why and everything

1420
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:21,049
even in in in making YouTube videos

1421
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:23,089
looking at like other people's videos

1422
00:56:21,049 --> 00:56:24,980
that are doing really well I had to

1423
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:26,809
learn from it I don't wasn't always you

1424
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,670
know successful in YouTube it's you just

1425
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:31,819
watch videos and see like oh I just

1426
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:34,940
posted a video that's a skit ought to be

1427
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:36,799
ninja and it did so much better than

1428
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,720
like the lip syncs and I'm like why does

1429
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:40,579
why did this get so much more views you

1430
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,529
know like I didn't know at the time but

1431
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:44,930
if you always ask yourself why in every

1432
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:49,279
scenario I think it helps everything in

1433
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:54,410
life final Twitter question is how was

1434
00:56:49,279 --> 00:56:56,750
your guys's first kiss first chaos to be

1435
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:58,880
honest I don't really remember mine damn

1436
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:01,279
play a play in the house it's not

1437
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,720
because I've kissed a lot of girls oh do

1438
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:05,289
you remember yours like very big I

1439
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:09,740
remember my first kiss ooh it was

1440
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:17,299
outside of a movie theater and it was

1441
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:18,799
very how old are you 15 or 16 15 but

1442
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:20,750
what is that sophomore year for us

1443
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:23,900
sophomore junior sophomore junior was a

1444
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:28,309
freshman Oh another 14 or 15 okay

1445
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:31,220
outside a movie theater and it was I'm

1446
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:32,680
pretty sure her first kiss or not

1447
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:36,609
experienced because I do remember

1448
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:40,130
kissing and then trying to use tongue

1449
00:57:36,609 --> 00:57:41,960
and and the weird part was that it was

1450
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:43,160
so I thought she was

1451
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,040
more experienced because she was the one

1452
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,869
dislike sticker talking here yes and it

1453
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,640
was like a little like I didn't know

1454
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:51,140
what didn't really know what to do to be

1455
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:53,380
honest and like I just had there was

1456
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:57,109
like this little whirling effect went on

1457
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:59,330
like a little tumbling like her tongue

1458
00:57:57,109 --> 00:58:00,859
as I do a little circle thing and then

1459
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:08,570
by just because I didn't know better I

1460
00:58:00,859 --> 00:58:11,780
started circling back that TMI or what

1461
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:14,839
no no but I do remember that vividly

1462
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:19,339
because we as hugging kinda like just

1463
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:24,680
like I embrace I guess was it like it

1464
00:58:19,339 --> 00:58:26,720
was like a hug yeah yeah and I just

1465
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,820
remember your eyes closed are open I

1466
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,220
don't remember that but I'm gonna assume

1467
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:33,020
closed cuz I don't I don't specifically

1468
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:35,300
remember blend yeah I do remember the

1469
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:37,130
tongue thing I was like that's not is

1470
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:39,470
that how it is that sounds like a

1471
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:42,320
stereotypical first case like outside of

1472
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:44,359
a well I mean that wasn't like it wasn't

1473
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,339
even up I thought was thought it was

1474
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:48,230
just a peck right and then we like

1475
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:50,900
kissed and then we just stayed there and

1476
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:53,900
then the tongue came him swirling around

1477
00:58:50,900 --> 00:59:04,130
and then I didn't know but I mean like

1478
00:58:53,900 --> 00:59:06,589
and then I started swirling back that's

1479
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:09,080
a good first story earth it's not wasn't

1480
00:59:06,589 --> 00:59:10,940
good but it was it's a good story

1481
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,950
it hasn't happened since so fine

1482
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,060
honestly if I had to think back I was

1483
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:17,150
probably really young

1484
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:18,650
I'd be like 9 or 10 day but it wasn't

1485
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:20,660
like a tongue thing I think it was like

1486
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:23,180
I spin the bottle with like curling up

1487
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:24,740
neighborhood girls and we yeah we kissed

1488
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,800
on like probably kiss like on the lips I

1489
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:29,869
was like oh cool yeah right you thought

1490
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,760
was so cool I mean I thought I was cool

1491
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:34,940
but I didn't get no swirly swirls with

1492
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,560
tongue so yeah but I was pretty young so

1493
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,780
that's why it was not like that it's not

1494
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:42,859
like a typical in a cool story like that

1495
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:44,330
