105
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,530
gonna bring up something about the words

106
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,240
losing the 3 2 1 lead again I'm not

107
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,770
stupid Ryan I know your patterns and to

108
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,940
be honest so does your audience and I

109
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,290
hate to be the one to break it to you

110
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,650
but someone's gotta say it's getting

111
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,070
really old now I'll do that um that kind

112
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,540
of hurts

113
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:33,639
I mean like for the record I actually

114
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,240
was gonna do this whole pad thing and

115
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,190
use your idea but oh maybe you're right

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,260
it's all getting too old too predictable

117
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,060
well maybe I was being a little harsh

118
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,010
no you're right it's the same thing over

119
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,240
and over enough is enough it's all one

120
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,240
big pattern pattern

121
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,660
you're right all along it was the

122
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,580
biggest trend of the year what I'm not

123
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,490
falling if you spell up a path it's P P

124
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,990
a P P P a P is the pattern if this

125
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,930
pattern continued what would be the next

126
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,120
letters T a a P I don't know what are

127
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,470
you trying to get at it's a a a this is

128
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,770
the biggest trend of the year Derek was

129
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,290
right so was i see P P a P is actually a

130
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,240
song mocking the Warriors losing a 3-1

131
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,830
lead you see what both right really

132
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,420
could you guys see the pattern yet this

133
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,970
is the exact way that the Warriors start

134
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,110
off the finals three P's to 1a and in

135
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,890
the exact same order

136
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:31,680
win-win lost win followed by loss loss

137
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:33,300
loss Derek what are you doing I'm over

00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,480
how you did it but you somehow connected

143
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,800
PPAP dissing on the Warriors didn't make

144
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,390
