1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,529
there's an epidemic happening right now

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,680
spreading across the entire world and

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,269
soon the whole nation Twinkies are dying

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,849
they're disappearing from pantries

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,120
shelves offices and all of them put

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:18,270
together pelvises before we know it

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,500
Twinkies will be gone forever unless we

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,880
do something about it and if you never

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,890
had a Twinkie before I know what you're

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,930
thinking all this over a fatty snack

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,930
well it's not just a snack it's much

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,910
much more like a dessert or a type of

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,890
pastry or like a school bus filled with

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,290
a bunch of kids they need a tan Twinkies

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,059
are a way of life it's my childhood you

16
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,540
know they've always been around since I

17
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,250
was a toddler I mean all the way till

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,750
now I'm an adult I don't know what it is

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,969
about Twinkies they just keep you

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,190
extremely youthful you know when times

21
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,890
are tough some people eat ice cream some

22
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,870
people eat drugs but in my most

23
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,670
depressing moments Twinkies have always

24
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,760
been there for me you're such a good

25
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,539
listener 20 you are so sweet

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,010
especially on the inside when you take

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,290
that first bite into a Twinkie it's like

28
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,840
watching a unicorn jump over a luscious

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,560
rainbows at farts goal does it seem

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,299
tender kittens bark velvet cotton candy

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,020
it's just not the same some people claim

32
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,490
it's better this way

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,930
they said that Twinkies are unhealthy

34
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,549
and they cause obesity well I've never

35
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,350
seen a Twinkie sit on a man and kill him

36
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,150
not the way that a cow can yeah we still

37
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,830
eat burgers don't we these are facts and

38
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,000
it's not just terrible for us think of

39
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,220
all the Twinkies and what they're going

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,260
through don't have to do this Twinkie

41
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,120
listen to me you're the last week in the

42
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,190
world if you jump there will be no more

43
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,010
have some faith I thought you believed

44
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,570
in hostess do you know what it's like

45
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,540
waking up every morning hoping your box

46
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,620
doesn't get chosen and when it does

47
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,440
watching each of your family members

48
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:51,250
being slaughtered so do I believe in

49
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,350
hostess but if he does exist tell me why

50
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,720
why would he create us to live such a

51
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:02,380
cruel life drinking you can the plastic

52
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:03,940
is already off right no goodbyes no just

53
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,640
don't let this happen not just for us

54
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,350
before the Twinkies so please don't let

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,970
them die just spread the message and

56
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,020
save the to save the Twinkies and

57
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,400

58
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,400
situation again ever

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,870
[Music]
