made they they made up this film called

69
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:06,540
the land you know they do a lot of like

70
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:08,040
super you know ethnic driven films so

71
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,500
they're like a good partner for this but

72
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,909
yeah it's about like you know with like

73
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,560
deportation and stuff these days you

74
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,160
know we have the dreamers and daca but

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,750
like part of it that people aren't

76
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,239
talking about is people who were adopted

77
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,849
here internationally from like the 70s

78
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,560
and 80s are getting deported people who

79
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,180
are adopted here by why you what do you

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,919
mean by US citizens so you adopted

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,329
meaning like they flew them like ship

82
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,280
them over yeah like you know when you

83
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,409
adopt baby from Africa or China or Korea

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,209
oh I don't know about that I mean I know

85
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:41,609
people do it but ya know see do you know

86
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,049
any like real house aren't illegal at

87
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:44,699
that point as I'm saying that's why it's

88
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,870
really messed up you say that is hat so

89
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,879
there you go but they're getting

90
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,799
deported well yeah what's happening is

91
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,379
that that that they get brought to this

92
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,109
country you know and this is there's a

93
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,090
child Citizenship Act of 2000 so anyone

94
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,739
adopted after that gets automatically

95
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,040
granted citizenship huh but anyone

96
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,449
before that is detected so if they got

97
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,989
adopted here and the parents didn't file

98
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:09,239
like the proper paperwork yeah now like

99
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,069
with the current administration himself

100
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,459
ice is so aggressive that they are using

101
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:17,669
loopholes to deport people like that

102
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,609
have no connection to their homeland and

103
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:22,889
like you know they were like brought

104
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:24,719
here as kids and you know International

105
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,190
Adoption a lot of money is exchanged and

106
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:29,320
right it's uh it's

107
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,990
it's really bad it's really sad dude

108
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,900
that's hella sad yeah what year was this

109
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,870
after their okay after 2000 I think is

110
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,340
when when they you bring so a baby from

111
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,380
a different country they're protected

112
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,880
but anyone before which is just a stupid

113
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,140
loophole yeah yeah so like you know

114
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,590
people from as your movie is about

115
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:54,480
though yeah well it's about a guy who is

116
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:57,370
dealing with that and he's uh you know

117
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:03,400
korean-american in and grew up in in the

118
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:04,810
south and yeah so like you know he's

119
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,340
just trying to get us left he's starting

120
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,920
to like really get his life together and

121
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,020
then bad stuff happens it and then he

122
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,770
has to deal with the possibility of

123
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,170
getting deported

124
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,880
okay well I mean just going back because

125
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,680
I didn't really for people who don't

126
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,270

127
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,550

129
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:27,430

long for like 18 years 19 18 years and I

131
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,150
mean he's you're not really acting as

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,920
much you're doing more like directing

133
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,960

for Disney and stuff you know and I I

183
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,850
always wanted to be like an Asian Sean

184
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:31,330
Penn you know I wanted to be a serious

185
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,740
actor so I was planning to really stay

186
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,200
away from anything that's kind of like

187
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,000
you know I wanted to try to find serious

188
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,090
roles you do some indie films that are

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,250
and then my agent called me and said

190
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,810

192
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:50,410

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:52,240
like hell no can you cuss on this yeah

194
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,380

196
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,640

00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,900
a lot of options for you cuz you know at

199
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,140
that time you know it wasn't as open as

200
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,180
it is now yeah so a ginger yeah so like

201
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:14,110
the roles are limited so I was just like

202
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:16,480
okay well who's uh who's directing it

203
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,610
and she he was like Catherine Hardwicke

204
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,590
I was like oh and she did a movie called

205
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,530
thirteen and Lords of Dogtown that I was

206
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,480
loved resume yeah she she did like indie

207
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,510
films I really loved and then I was like

208
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,550
well who's a main star like it's in he

209
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,190
was like well this girl named Kristen

210
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,620
Stewart I was like oh because I had seen

211
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,300
a film called into the wild yeah and she

212
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,590
has a pardon that she's just so amazing

213
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,260
in it and I was like I would love to

214
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,000
work with her and then and uh and that's

215
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,390
why I auditioned and and I auditioned

216
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,810
like I don't know six seven times and

217
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,610
what I mean

218
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,710
because it was yeah because it was

219
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,690
during the writers strike yeah so they

220
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,370
couldn't rewrite stuff like so we had to

221
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,380
do a lot of improv

222
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,970
so you go in and and because they

223
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,310
couldn't write new stuff we had to go

224
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,560
and and improvise a lot of scenes with

225
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,650
the other sort of potential cast members

226
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,570
and then uh yeah I showed up I was like

227
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,990
okay well I'm really excited to work

228
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,850
with these people but the film itself I

229
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,330
don't give a [ __ ] you know like it's

230
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,840
like you know um and you know like the

231
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,670
books it's based off books and stuff but

232
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,260
you know I was really excited to work

233
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,850
with the people involved but like the

234
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,130
actual story I was like well you know

235
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,100
it's it's just an opportunity and right

236
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:33,190
and and but the other thing is it's I

237
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,450
don't think they wanted me oh really cuz

238
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,970
I was Asian

239
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,860
I think Catherine Erik your key right

240
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,940
yeah is that isn't that well I don't

241
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,390
know is that a asian character in the

242
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,550
book

243
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:45,820
no but they don't specify his ethnicity

244
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:48,220
just that he has black hair and like I

245
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,580
think like nasty pimply scan or

246
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,140
something I don't know but uh but um

247
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,330
Catherine I think came out recently

248
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,880
saying like she had a prob she had

249
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,650
problems casting minorities yeah but

250
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,510
yeah I don't think they really wanted me

251
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:04,360
because you know was Washington forks

252
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,640
Washington they didn't feel like but uh

253
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,950
there yeah so catherine fought for me

254
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,460
and that i am proud of you know anytime

255
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,800
I can get rolled it isn't meant for me I

256
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,990
was really proud of that so um but you

257
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,720
know and and the fact that I'm the only

258
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,490
Asian in that entire series is is pretty

259
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,950
cool yeah like it's like another fun

260
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,750
fact is like that for those people who

261
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:30,160
don't know you actually did YouTube I

262
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,640
did yeah I did because um because of you

263
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,490
guys

264
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,990
hmm he's you and Kevin you did it a lot

265
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,400
I mean they consistently you were

266
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,320
consistent for a little bit I did it for

267
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,260
like a like a maybe like half a year

268
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,630
yeah your intro is I love doing thanks

269
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:48,370
but um it's I think he would understand

270
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,230
how hard work it is how much right how

271
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,520
much hard work and I was like dude this

272
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:59,860
is like from not for me hard work hard

273
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:01,630
work your other it's a real career it's

274
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,280
real it's its own career and like I

275
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,870
can't do it part-time yeah I thought I

276
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,400
can maybe like just kind of do it like

277
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,230
when I have free time but it's not the

278
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,940
case like it has to be a full-time game

279
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,740
you know and I was just too busy like

280
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,590
acting and and doing other stuff and

281
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,920
just way bigger things no no it's not

282
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:20,530
that like I know like YouTube is even

283
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,240
bigger than like I think if you're on a

284
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,340
network television show uh-huh

285
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,160
no one knows who you are Yeah right like

286
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,290
I was just on a show for ABC

287
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,580
nobody has ever recognized me from that

288
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,980
like no one's ever said oh yeah you're

289
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,050
that guy for that ABC show but like

290
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,210
people recognize me from your YouTube

291
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,430
videos

292
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,140
yeah yeah well I think it depends on

293
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,420
like the size of what your project right

294
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,740
cuz you were in I mean like people

295
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,030
obviously don't you from Twilight

296
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,790
because the fan base was so big yeah

297
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:53,980
right once you talk about how you turn

298
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:57,580
down pitch perfect yeah go and this is

299
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,320
all interesting yeah this is all things

300
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,210
that I have never talked about I know

301
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,580
that's all yeah and I think it's so

302
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,700
interesting yeah because it's an inside

303
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,590
world too like a star's life yeah yeah

304
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,540
well it's not a start yeah I mean so

305
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:16,600
it's to a certain degree yeah but uh

306
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:19,780
yeah I had just finished shooting 21 and

307
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,620
over and skylar astin was in 21 and over

308
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:28,240
with me and we both got cast in pitch

309
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:32,290
perfect so I went straight over from

310
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,770
from Seattle to I think it was Baton

311
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,810
Rouge or Shreveport Louisiana so I went

312
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:41,860
from one hotel to another and I was like

313
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,480
man I just I wasn't um you know I

314
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,400
thought I wanted to do it and I showed

315
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,060
up and and you know and I was there

316
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,400
who's who's you know I love and and Nona

317
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:55,570
for a long time so like I I was really

318
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:59,740
stoked and then but then um you know we

319
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:01,810
uh got there and I was I saw the reality

320
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,090
of what it was what it was it's like a

321
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,410
musical mm-hmm

322
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,360
and you didn't want to do it and I was

323
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,400
just like what you sing to like what so

324
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,500
like so like yeah the audition was like

325
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,840
you had to sing a song and and whatever

326
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,120
and and you know I sent a tape in and

327
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,290
and I also do think that Skylar put in a

328
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,940
good word because he got cast as lead

329
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,580
he's like hey you need to cast this guy

330
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,800
so I showed up and then so weird then I

331
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,530
myself in like dance rehearsal for like

332
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,180
80 hours a day and then we and then we

333
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,460
were also doing like singing rehearsal

334
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,050
and like and I was just sitting there

335
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,880
like in and we're sitting in like a

336
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,650
circle we're all picking out parts and I

337
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,820
was just trying to do like a falsetto

338
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:41,440
and I was like dude this is not I feel

339
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,620
like a phony I just don't feel like I

340
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,600
belong here cuz Han because what you

341
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,210

point with them or like why like yeah I

343
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:55,110
just I just didn't like it yeah and I

344
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,110
just felt like really kind of stupid

345
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,150
personal experience is like you know and

346
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,890
every day at the end of the day we would

347
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,770
kind of show the director the

348
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,300

yeah and I was like which is probably

384
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,619
the dumbest thing I ever did is I gave

385
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,389

441
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:41,059
pieced it out and

442
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,320
maybe you hate him so much like why did

443
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,970
you guys hate each other so I don't know

444
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,010
man I just like I mean we're both

445
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,870
different people ya know and I can't

446
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,000
like speak on his behalf because it's

447
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,490
you know I I know what's going on in his

448
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,889
life but like I was just I was also a

449
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,450
different person yeah and I you know I

450
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:58,250
just we just didn't get along

451
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,049
you know sometimes you know when you

452
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,159
meet somebody for the first time they

453
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:06,919
rub you the wrong way and you you just

454
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:10,309
yeah you just don't vibe with somebody I

455
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,200
feel like and here's the thing is

456
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,760
sometimes you don't vibe because

457
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,710
actually you're a lot more similar than

458
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,870
you'd like to admit mm-hmm you know and

459
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,179
you see I think you see parts of

460
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,460
yourself in somebody that you don't like

461
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:25,399
but you're actually like you're actually

462
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,500
like hating on yourself but then you

463
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:32,269
eats your insecurities that make you

464
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:34,880
kind of hone in on that and start to

465
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:36,320
like you know let it bother you but but

466
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,610
I don't know a car she's a sweetheart

467
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,529
he's a really amazing guy and and yeah

468
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,970
we're totally cool now and we've we've

469
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:46,669
hung out a bunch of time since then so

470
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:49,070
like you know I think sometimes that

471
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:52,519
kind of conflict helps you actually

472
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,929
become closer I don't know that's I mean

473
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:55,789
you want to talk about pitch perfect

474
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:57,559
this stuff is like Opie we're gonna clip

475
00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:01,159

different actors okay well I mean I did

477
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,789
want to because I think that's

478
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:05,899
interesting and yeah super it's an

479
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:08,029
inside look that a lot of people don't

480
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:09,380

484
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:16,490
really your claim to fame currently is

485
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,549

518
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,239

with guides for money so it kind of

538
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:36,409
explores that world in a way but but

539
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,239
it's really about a brother and sisters

540
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:40,700
relationship I have a younger sister and

541
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:43,249
our our relationship has been pretty

542
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,840
complicated over the years and you know

543
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:47,119
I'm dealing with our parents and and

544
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,580
kind of divvying up responsibilities and

545
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,359
I think the the brother-sister

546
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:55,519
relationship specifically is pretty

547
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:57,679
particular because it's like one's a guy

548
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:00,590
and what's a girl and and I haven't seen

549
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,980
that really sort of explored in film you

550
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:06,440
know there's only a few films that that

551
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,890
talk about I mean like you know you can

552
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,920
count on

553
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,610
the savages skeleton twins but that's

554
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,670
about it

555
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,920
you know I mean I feel like age of 17

556
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:19,520
kind of touched on it because like you

557
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,660
know the you know the girl is dealing

558
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,240
with all this stuff and then you find

559
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,860
out the brother you know there was all

560
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,990
these stuff that he was holding him but

561
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,700
like it wasn't like a main sort of thing

562
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,090
this is like the main meal is like their

563
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:36,970
relationship but it's also empower

564
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:40,730
empowering story like she she needs to I

565
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:44,900
think she lives in a very lonely

566
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:46,250
solitude existence of a world and part

567
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,230
of her journey is to understand that

568
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,240
there's a world outside of hers and

569
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,680
that's why there was a Chicano whole

570
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,810
Chicano storyline that weaves through

571
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,780
the story and and things that kind of

572
00:22:53,810 --> 00:23:00,500
bring her out of her comfort zone and by

573
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:04,340
the end you know I think she starts to

574
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:07,340
realize and learn how maybe she can live

575
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,650
a healthier life but when this is come

576
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,690
out this comes out September 16 Ola in

577
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:14,900
November 6 in LA and then New York you

578
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,270
said New York the next weekend and then

579
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,880
other it'll be in San Francisco Seattle

580
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:23,180
like it'll be in most major cities ok

581
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,120
yeah it's called miss purple yeah and I

582
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,910
was curious as to a your writing process

583
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,370
and how you get into that because the

584
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:33,530
whole brother-sister relationship like

585
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:36,350
you're obviously drawing from that

586
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:38,090
experience and uh maybe like with Kuk

587
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,850
and stuff if you want to talk about that

588
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:43,880
because uh it shows like different

589
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,590
ingress intricacies I think it was

590
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,930
during the the riots right yeah it's

591
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:51,530
takes place during that 90 to LA riots

592
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:53,780
yeah and then your next one is with kind

593
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,660
of like deportation and I'm not sure if

594
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,460
you have any actual experience with it

595
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,650
but maybe like you can kind of take us

596
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,110
through this story of all three yeah

597
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,790
well you know I think I have a there's a

598
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,840
reason or purpose for the art that I

599
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:10,790
make I mean I feel like most people on

600
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,060
the internet know me to be an idiot but

601
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:18,970
I think it is it you know as a filmmaker

602
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:20,400
i i i my purpose really solely is to

603
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,460
there's a few thing

604
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,050
actually the first and foremost is I am

605
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,540
trying to bring empathy to our community

606
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,490
as Asian Americans so like if somebody

607
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:33,330
that's outside of our community watches

608
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:36,630
a film they maybe understand how we

609
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,370
operator or can can empathize for us a

610
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:40,800
little bit more so that's a first

611
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:43,020
criteria second criteria is you know we

612
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,270
have crazy rich Asians black panther and

613
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,110
and all these sort of uh you know miss

614
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:52,320
Bala these films that are strictly you

615
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,840
know cast and include people of that

616
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,880
ethnicity which is great but I'm also

617
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,760
interested in my art exploring how we

618
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,240
coexist and interconnect and all that

619
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:07,650
stuff so those are two things that that

620
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:12,770
that drive me in terms of what I want to

621
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:15,090
say is for the writing process you know

622
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,820
everything I do has to be it needs to be

623
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,500
coming from a very personal place the

624
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,030
one I'm about to do I read a few news

625
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,000
articles about people who were getting

626
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:25,620
deported and just really I just every

627
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,870
time I read a story like that I would

628
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,820
start crying like crazy because it's

629
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,870
really sad and it's like some of these

630
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,940
people have to leave their families

631
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,280
behind and you know me being like a new

632
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,850
dad and having a one and a half year old

633
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:42,330
like I couldn't even imagine that and

634
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:44,340
also like just for somebody like that to

635
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,480
be abandoned by the parents and given up

636
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,620
for adoption and then a lot of these

637
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,900
people go through the foster care system

638
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,630
because even their adopted parents

639
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,190
sometimes don't want them and then you

640
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,730
know fast forward like two decades

641
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:59,130
finding out that the us the place you

642
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,040
could call home doesn't want you and is

643
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:04,800
kicking you out I think that's a very

644
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:07,140
it's like it's like getting pretty much

645
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,610
kicked in the ass yeah your whole life

646
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,060
yeah it's pretty my heart goes out to

647
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:14,160
them so like you know giving a platform

648
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:18,960
to a community that doesn't have a voice

649
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:22,290
I think is a worthwhile endeavor so you

650
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,830
know that those are some reasons why I

651
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:27,150
make the art that I do and and and you

652
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,100
know I want to be like sort of the

653
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,720
counter-programming we have like the

654
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:36,140
Justin Lin's and the James wands and and

655
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,220
you know John choose and and they're

656
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,720
doing amazing working they're really

657
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,420
great in that studio of like big-time

658
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,640
studio system I think I'm really great

659
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,950
at drama and you know and I in comedy

660
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,040
and stuff but like much more intimate in

661
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,330
real kind of stories so I'm like the

662
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,690
counter-programming to that and I think

663
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,520
I I just make a nice balance I think

664
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,230
it's really interesting that you um I

665
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,850
mean a lot of people say that right a

666
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,700
lot of artists will say I'm all about

667
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,800
like the art and not anything else not

668
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,560
like the fame not I just want to make

669
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,720
art yeah but you were presented with

670
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:12,050
some huge opportunities to work with

671
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,170
like hundred like really really finance

672
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,520
films like big studios you you were I

673
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,810
mean you were offered basically you

674
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,370
could have went that route yeah you

675
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,680
could have went the route of B being the

676
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:23,750
next director of a Marvel film or

677
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,060
something but instead you chose I mean

678
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:28,310
that doesn't appeal to you well money

679
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:36,800
doesn't drive me that's the biggest

680
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:38,180
thing is is uh I've seen what money like

681
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,510
in Fame and all that I've seen people

682
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,190
have it right and we all know that that

683
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,350
doesn't make you happy I mean it's not

684
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:49,100
it can't you can be happy with money and

685
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:52,010
fame if you're sort of internal

686
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,930
compasses right but if it's just that's

687
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,120
the only thing you're looking for you're

688
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,280
gonna find yourself very very empty

689
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,980
so money doesn't drive me it's I think

690
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,650
money is a great sort of indicator if

691
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:06,560
you're doing great work there's a money

692
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,370
I think follows Talent right so I don't

693
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,500
focus on that

694
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:12,620
I don't focus on the biggest opportunity

695
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:15,460
or the biggest career move I fee I focus

696
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:20,000
on what feels right to me and and

697
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:23,210
artistically and and spiritually and you

698
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,910
know um what makes sense for my family I

699
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,770
think if you do one of those huge movies

700
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:30,380
you won't see your family for like three

701
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:32,300
years you're like constantly working and

702
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,710
and you're having to answer someone

703
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,040
that's the other thing that I really

704
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,340
really value is autonomy like I really

705
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,680
value being the master of my own life

706
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,750
mm-hmm and not having to answer to like

707
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,460
people telling me what I have to do or

708
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:51,050
how I need to do it so

709
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:53,840
with art so I value that so like you

710
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:56,450
know those kind of opportunities I'm

711
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,760
very flattered but as of right now I

712
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,700
think there's a there's a lot of work to

713
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,650
be done that I feel is important that I

714
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,330
need to do first I'm not saying I'll

715
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:08,000
never do it you know like yeah be really

716
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:10,040
fun to do like a big million yeah a

717
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,050
hundred million dollar movie but you

718
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,630
know my my babies like really young and

719
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:16,580
I don't miss out babies like really my

720
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,490
babies like little a baby hahaha

721
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,170
my baby's a baby and I never get that

722
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,780
time back with her yeah so you know I

723
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:25,820
work from home like I do like my editor

724
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,430
Reynolds who's also from Hawaii Reynolds

725
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:33,380
Barney and uh his name is actual

726
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:35,690
Reynolds Barney roasting here I know I

727
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:39,020
love him though but like he's over at my

728
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:43,060
house we're editing in uh in my office

729
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:45,500
and like I do that purpose and I and I

730
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,120
stay home as much as I can to be with my

731
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,100
baby but if I was doing studio film

732
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,290
I really doubt they're gonna let me edit

733
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,640
from my home and of course yeah so

734
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,140
they're gonna make me edit from the Edit

735
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,730
Bay they're gonna come in and out to

736
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,060
look at the progress and everything and

737
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:00,350
but uh you know I do that so I can

738
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,960
astronaut like for now at least you know

739
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,460
when when my kid doesn't want me around

740
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,440
then maybe yeah that's maybe when I'll

741
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,260
go do like a bigger film and just bounce

742
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,440
and and do that whole thing but right

743
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:15,800
now I think like there are some stories

744
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:19,190
that I think can change people's opinion

745
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,710
you know in a different way and I tell

746
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:25,070
stories about people who aren't the

747
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:27,650
point zero one percent you know like my

748
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:31,790
stories aren't really like fantastical

749
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:33,710
they're like a realistic look at our

750
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:37,430
lives you know like it's a lot of my

751
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:39,380
films are about the working-class you

752
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,940
know they're not about like super rich

753
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,970
people they're they're just about like

754
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,660
normal people like us you know and and I

755
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,980
also think that's valuable yeah well

756
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:52,010
with that being said we'll come back and

757
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,320
we'll talk about another film that we

758
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:55,520
had in mind yeah yeah but before we get

759
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,980
there we have to take a quick shishi

760
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:08,549
break and we are out

761
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:13,480
[Music]

762
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:17,830
and we're back and we're back back gtfo

764
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,840
about our new upcoming yes oh you were

765
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,690
talking about how you like do more real

766
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,110
things mm-hmm and never me and Justin

767
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:32,140
caught with ideas because it's usually

768
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,649
stemming from me it's really dumb like

769
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,299
really

770
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:36,669
we have really dumb eyes but I like that

771
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,020
too yeah it's a it's it's a nice break

772
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:39,640
right yeah you've got to have your meal

773
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,320
but you also have to have your dessert

774
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,909
yeah I think that's something that I

775
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,419
really like about you is that you don't

776
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:49,029
try to like you know get stuck in like

777
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:50,950
one cubicle like you have a lot of

778
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:52,779
different facets to in one cube yeah

779
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,490
yeah you have many different phases to

780
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:56,950
your keep allotted little cubes yeah

781
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:00,039

cube he yep

783
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:02,649
but know that I think that's what's

784
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,600
really cool about you is that you know

785
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:06,309
there's so many different sides to you

786
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,870
that there are some people who are gonna

787
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:09,909

I just I just want to live a full life

795
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,460
mm-hmm you know and I think it's life is

796
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:44,590
there's too many things experience them

797
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,850
to just be one thing you know and I feel

798
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,100
like that's what you guys are doing like

799
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,960
with this podcast and right you guys try

800
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,480
not new stuff and like you could just be

801
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,580
doing the same old but like yeah there's

802
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,620
too much cool stuff to do that to just

803
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:00,070
be like the serious guy or the funny guy

804
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:02,710
or that's why I love when I see you know

805
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:05,260
comedians do like dramas and stuff yeah

806
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:09,149
I love like when Jim Carrey did The

807
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:12,040
Truman Show or Eternal Sunshine you know

808
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:14,410
and I also like when when

809
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,240
really serious guys that do like stupid

810
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,980
comedies like when Matt Damon did that

811
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,550
one film with Greg Kinnear I think it's

812
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:23,290
stuck on you where they play Siamese

813
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:26,080
like stuff like that you know I love

814
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:30,670
when they do stuff like that but I think

815
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,800
that um I think there's so many ways we

816
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,140
can like express ourselves why limited

817
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,750
to just yeah the same old boring

818
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,640
[ __ ] so let's talk about how you you

819
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:42,670
guys are gonna explore yourself in this

820
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,760
new dumb idea that you have this dumb

821
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:48,550
idea um I mean it's been a long time

822
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,160
like still saying we're gonna do it but

823
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:54,190
we just never do it but we are trying to

824
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,360
write a BG a movie for people who I

825
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,820
don't know if you don't know what that

826
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,510
is it's just our fake kpop band that we

827
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:05,380
had started off as one video a joke

828
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:07,870
and it just ended like really well it

829
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,450
did a huge international reach yeah it

830
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,950
it I remember the first one because it's

831
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:14,290
literally singing dongs idea which means

832
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:17,169
I have to take a [ __ ] right yeah yeah

833
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:19,000
I died initially is just me and David

834
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:22,060
right we just I recorded it's just my

835
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,890
voice really and then we're like okay

836
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,140
well we need a band and I was like okay

837
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:28,210
what Asians do I know that can be a part

838
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,770
is obviously Justin's one right because

839
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,060
I know he can sing too if we I mean we

840
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,770
didn't you didn't really need to sing

841
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:37,810
but and then I got feel because I know

842
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:39,700
he likes to dance and then Jun I kind of

843
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:41,200
just met but I knew he was into kpop

844
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:44,440
yeah it was just super helpful to have

845
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,270
him he's like the identity of kpop yes

846
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,610
he's literate like beep that's his life

847
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,470
he literally is doing still like on his

848
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:54,000
by himself he's doing like carried on

849
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:57,010
with BJ by himself he's literally like

850
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,480
the last video was about him leaving the

851
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,490
group and start doing it because he's

852
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,830
the star yeah and and he's it's

853
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:05,350
happening yeah it's real life you know

854
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,940
actually I've gone to some general

855
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,160
meetings with like some studio people

856
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,840
yeah and they bring it up they break up

857
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,200
beat you here yeah they go like so hey

858
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:16,390
what is this dude yeah some like a few

859
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,280
particular we're like hey so Thomas it's

860
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,860
like what is this BGA thing and I starts

861
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,720
are laughing why did you watch that

862
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:25,840
because these are like old white men you

863
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,640
know and I'm like wow

864
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,950
why though it cuz they do they have kids

865
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,170
is that I don't know oh I didn't ask I

866
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,550
was just typing justin chon yeah but

867
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,690
then they love it they're just like no

868
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:40,750
it's like so fun and they love it but um

869
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:42,660
but I think we also like that's that's

870
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:46,390
something that you did was sort of like

871
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:48,490
with the whole YouTube you bridge use

872
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,650
help bridge the gap because it started

873
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:52,450
off such a little thing and you you and

874
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,700
some other people like really blew it up

875
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:57,840
into something that's like more now it's

876
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:02,200
mainstream like YouTube is not like it's

877
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:04,390
not a niche thing it's more actually

878
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,640
more big than we were talking about that

879
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:08,920
like TV shows or whatever it is so the

880
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,860
point of where networks are adapting to

881
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,560
like kind of the YouTube formula

882
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:16,660
ya know it's all about streaming and

883
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,630
videos on demand yeah so I feel like

884
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,160
it's just as legitimate you know I

885
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,080
remember I will actually be on Twilight

886
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,850
explaining to them I was like yeah I'm

887
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,560
doing this YouTube thing and they're

888
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,910
like why would you do that why would you

889
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,010
waste your time yeah and I was like no

890
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:32,170
no no you don't understand like this can

891
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,270
be you know reach a lot of people and

892
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,700
it's it's the new thing that's that I

893
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:40,590
feel it's gonna be huge and and I end

894
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:42,550
you know watching how you guys were

895
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,930

963
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,950
all very exaggerated versions of

964
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:45,680
ourselves David David's question to you

965
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:51,680
is are you secretly in love with June

966
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,760
curry on a man sexuality it should be

967
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,010
fluid

968
00:39:52,760 --> 00:40:05,390
so I I'm not I wouldn't be ashamed of

969
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:06,830
Robin this is going you know that space

970
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,200
between the ball that's why you want to

971
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:11,960
pull his hair but I know I think I come

972
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:27,760
from a place he comes from uh straight

973
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:30,230
yeah I think I sexual frustration yeah

974
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,210
funny the hall that natural like that

975
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:34,130
relation like the first script you

976
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:35,390
weren't really I'm trying to remember

977
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,030
how it started you weren't we weren't

978
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:39,860
mean - you weren't mean to June yeah I

979
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,880
think it's a sieve all just happened

980
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,220
like on Sarah

981
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,750
yeah like it just became an ongoing you

982
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,570
know what I think it was so I think it's

983
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,700
because he was like the the slave driver

984
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:52,520
we had to learn that stupid dance the

985
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,440
first the first video and I we like

986
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,970
actually had to rehearse yeah yeah and

987
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,640
I'm like I'm like learning from this

988
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:00,800
this guy I don't even know like I met

989
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,360
him through VGA and I'm like why are you

990
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,070
telling me what to do man and I think

991
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,720
that it's like that secret frustration

992
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:08,720
evolved from that mmm-hmm and that was

993
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,710
like oh but he's kind of cute but why

994
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:17,000
tell me what to do I felt bad for June a

995
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:18,590
lot because we are all so bad and like

996
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,560
not really taking the dance part

997
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:24,350
seriously and he was so serious about it

998
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,960
yeah yeah yeah I mean I told him from

999
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,610
the start like um cuz he choreographed

1000
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,140
the first one and then he had a friend

1001
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,310
helping us with the second one and I was

1002
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,410
like I saw the second I was like dude

1003
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,760
this is too hard man like but I gotta

1004
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,990
say the dancing and the first one's way

1005
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,970
better mm-hmm

1006
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,680
it was actually easier yeah it was

1007
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:43,520
easier but look did you notice how much

1008
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,920
we cut out of the dancing on yeah yeah

1009
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,910
but the dance our dancing was better in

1010
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,460
the first one mm-hmm

1011
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,380

viewers at home Paco and Ryan were in LA

1074
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,320
further apart there they're doing the

1075
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:36,730
podcast in LA and the plans yeah and we

1076
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,460
went out for some drinks and then we

1077
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:42,130
came back and we forced Paco to do a

1078
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:44,830
stand-up stand-up act for us and we all

1079
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:48,280
like critiqued him let's preface this

1080
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:50,200
like Paco never let me I would say like

1081
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,120
yeah oh he's like I'm gonna do an open

1082
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,010
mic and like he would never tell me

1083
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,050
where it was yeah I was like dude you

1084
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:58,840
need critics that like you need people

1085
00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:00,820
to tell you like when it's not good and

1086
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,860
also for sure yeah also we need to

1087
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:05,440
preface that we know nothing about

1088
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:08,200
stand-up comedy or we are like our

1089
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,210
opinions are valid in any way we just

1090
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,310
wanted to like give honest feedback of

1091
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:15,250
how like it's just normal people yeah

1092
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:17,230
like if we like it or not that's all

1093
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,370
like and another thing that I would put

1094
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,860
in is that you guys come from a

1095
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:22,660
standpoint of like storytelling no like

1096
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,940
you guys do really well at storytelling

1097
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,650
so in that aspect because my jokes

1098
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,200
aren't just like oh these are one-liners

1099
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:31,630
you know where it does come from a place

1100
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,460
of oh there's some reality to this so

1101
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:35,050
that's why I was like you know I do feel

1102
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,150
comfortable but also because I really do

1103
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:38,830
look up to you yeah but we were just we

1104
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,400
just wanted to we just wanted to get a

1105
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:42,640
little taste

1106
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,790
yeah of the Paco Jim and after I did my

1107
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,380
set they destroyed me for like a good 30

1108
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,900
minutes but I that's why I respect you

1109
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,460
more now because you you really took in

1110
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:54,280
stride you didn't let it like you know

1111
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,780
be personal and and you know that's hard

1112
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,820
to do like it's hard to take criticism

1113
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,080
you know we were too but we're just

1114
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,270
speaking from like a non professional

1115
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:04,960
stamp or just how we took it yeah yeah

1116
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:10,900
but uh but uh you know I think that

1117
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:12,760
right now Paco should do it well I mean

1118
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,370
I think I think how this could be

1119
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,650
relative to a lot of people is that yeah

1120
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:19,090
I mean I think people need to loop if

1121
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,700
you're gonna try and do something you

1122
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:23,890
have to like commit to it and then be

1123
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,600
open to the criticism I think yeah I

1124
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,550
think it's really tough to do no but

1125
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,650
there's a reason why and you understand

1126
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,720
why I didn't want you guys like I'm okay

1127
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:34,390
with performing at open mics and like

1128
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,339
bars coffee shop some people I have no

1129
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:39,099
idea who they are you know because that

1130
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:40,480
like in the end when I do stand-up

1131
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,960
comedy it's gonna be for people like

1132
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,369
that

1133
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,740
starting off it's gonna be for people

1134
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:46,750
who have no idea or Who I am with you

1135
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,460
guys it's a lot more personal because of

1136
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,770
the relationship that we have like the

1137
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,690
audience is seen Justin will [ __ ] on me

1138
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:54,490
all day and I'm cool with it and it's

1139
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:56,200
fun and then Ryan will do that too and

1140
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,089
I'm cool with it too but when it comes

1141
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,890
like oh this is something that you know

1142
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:02,799
I'm trying to work on this graph and

1143
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:04,510
stand up enough and then to have like to

1144
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:05,349
think oh are they just gonna [ __ ] on

1145
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,059
that too

1146
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:08,619
you know yeah yeah I see what you mean I

1147
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:10,779
see um so that's why I was very much so

1148
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:12,220
like Auto III would only want to invite

1149
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:13,930
you and only have you there when I get

1150
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:16,180
to a point like I'm comfortable I work

1151
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:17,950
on this hundreds of times you know I

1152
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,500
made this set good enough for I'm

1153
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:23,770
confident that I can get you to laugh

1154
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:25,809
yeah yeah well you feel proud yeah yeah

1155
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:27,609
but in the meantime tonight I think you

1156
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:30,069
have to you know when people come over

1157
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:31,119
to Ryan's house I think you know just

1158
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:36,670
the people know people are coming over

1159
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:38,619
to my house I think you know I would say

1160
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:40,119
I respect that that you took criticism

1161
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:41,619
very well yeah and I think that's that's

1162
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:43,809
important for a lot of people it's it's

1163
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:45,940
tough man in any zone

1164
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:47,829
especially if it's your job yeah you

1165
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,000
know if you just work and something you

1166
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:50,799
take pride in something you love and

1167
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,880
someone comes and criticizes you I mean

1168
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:53,319
it comes from a place of us trying to

1169
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,029
help right yeah yeah but even then

1170
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:56,829
that's tough man but that's a path to

1171
00:47:55,029 --> 00:48:00,640
progress that's a path to mastery ax is

1172
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:03,730
you have to you know be open to not

1173
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,869
being awesome you know and at least I

1174
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:10,630
can speak for myself is like I know like

1175
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:12,010
I'm like a novice and just starting out

1176
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:14,260
as a director and writer all that stuff

1177
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:17,289
and I need to I need to always be open

1178
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,150
and get wrekt all the time the more

1179
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:20,529
times I get wrecked the better I'll get

1180
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,880
because if I learn from it

1181
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:23,859
what's some negative criticism you've

1182
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,480
got in for like [ __ ] like [ __ ]

1183
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,250
specifically you know someone review

1184
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,150
said like you know it was kind of messy

1185
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:32,559
and but if you but they also talked

1186
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:35,319
about like you know you could tell there

1187
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,779
was a raw artists passion behind it

1188
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:40,510
that that it kind of makes up for it but

1189
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:42,039
but I have to admit yeah there's parts

1190
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,840
that are pretty rough and the way I shot

1191
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:46,050
it was super

1192
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:48,480
low budget and and scrappy so like I

1193
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:51,420
don't have time or or you know the

1194
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:54,750
resources to make it super polished but

1195
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:56,910
I look at it now and and taking that

1196
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:58,410
sort of note from the reviews and and

1197
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:02,010
you know I generally don't read the

1198
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:05,430
reviews it's more like you know asked

1199
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:08,400
like peers you know when especially when

1200
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:09,600
I'm when I'm editing and I'm getting to

1201
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,770
stage where it's getting kind of close

1202
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:15,210
to locking the the film so I could send

1203
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,810
it off to like sound and color and all

1204
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:18,120
that stuff

1205
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,590
I'll have we'll work on it and then at

1206
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,980
night I'll always have at least one

1207
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:25,110
screening and I'll I now invite the the

1208
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,910
scariest people that I that I admire or

1209
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:29,490
whatever and I'll have them watching and

1210
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:34,350
give me notes and sometimes it's really

1211
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:36,090
I'm like you know and and a lot of times

1212
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,100
are right and and always it always it's

1213
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,320
always a note behind the note so they

1214
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:43,200
might say like this section just doesn't

1215
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:45,600
it's kind of just like bad it sucks and

1216
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,490
then it's like I have to really go back

1217
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,390
and then be like okay instead of being

1218
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:50,580
like [ __ ] you you don't know what you're

1219
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:52,020
talking about just really think about it

1220
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,690
and get the note behind the note and

1221
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:57,990
maybe it's he's saying it just felt slow

1222
00:49:54,690 --> 00:50:00,060
or or maybe the editing wasn't crisp

1223
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:02,850
enough and it wasn't engaging enough and

1224
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:06,210
or like maybe he's saying it was bad

1225
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:07,950
because he wasn't clear on the the the

1226
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:09,060
protagonist sort of how they were

1227
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:10,650
feeling in the moment and that's

1228
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:13,260
something I have to decipher afterward

1229
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:14,550
but like for me to be like he doesn't

1230
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,700
know what he thought like that part's

1231
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:20,790
not bad like it's sometimes people their

1232
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,050
notes aren't you know because they're

1233
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:24,960
talking in the moment they haven't had

1234
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:27,900
time to process for a long time what

1235
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,160
they're saying so that's like an example

1236
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,860
you know and that has you know when I'm

1237
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,690
in the editing phase I'm constantly and

1238
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,700
then you know and then sometimes like

1239
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:38,010
you also but here's the other thing Paco

1240
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,390
is like sometimes you also have to stick

1241
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:41,580
to your guns sometimes you go no that's

1242
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:45,240
just my style or that's how I express

1243
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:49,740
myself you have to know when something

1244
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,270
is you know very sort of integral to who

1245
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:53,280
you are and in some stuff that's just

1246
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:56,040
more of a practical technical thing that

1247
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,880
you need to improve upon you know so

1248
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,010
like people

1249
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,320
were ragging on sort of some of my music

1250
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:03,450
choices in that saying it was to all

1251
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,700
over the place but I like that because

1252
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:06,990
I'm not one thing and they're like well

1253
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,540
there's too many tonal shifts in my

1254
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:12,030
films and I'm like frankly I don't give

1255
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,050
a [ __ ] about that specific thing that

1256
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:16,760
they're talking about and that's

1257
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:19,140
something that I I want to hold on to

1258
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,180
but yeah I don't know what kind of

1259
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:22,500
wrapping it up cuz time is uh but I just

1260
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,020
wanted to throw in one more Twitter

1261
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:30,120
question because you are actually the

1262
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:31,920
first father guest oh yeah we haven't

1263
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,000
had any guests that has ever thought

1264
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:39,020
about even had kids

1265
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,250
except for your mom yes yeah but so

1266
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:43,350
because you are kind of seen it again as

1267
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:47,670
a crazy person you know you're doing so

1268
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:50,430
many things um how is it has having a

1269
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:53,760
kid like changed your view on a lot of

1270
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:57,030
things or even life yeah it has that's

1271
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,580
the the simple answer but um I think

1272
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:02,670
having a kid can go two ways you can

1273
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:06,060
just live your life and kind of be

1274
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:08,160
irresponsible or if forces you be really

1275
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:11,460
you know we're talking my self-aware and

1276
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:14,280
introspective it forces you to examine

1277
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:17,040
who you are as a human because now you

1278
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:20,700
have this child that's coming to the

1279
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:23,250
world and and you have to you know you

1280
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:26,670
have to determine who you're gonna be

1281
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:29,640
and who the person that they're gonna

1282
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:31,950
call dad and so it's made me have to

1283
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,230
take a second look at the type of art

1284
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:36,540
that I'm making right so if you notice

1285
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:38,970
the art that I'm making is I mean

1286
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:41,310
speaking of which like how are you gonna

1287
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:43,140
explain to her BG hey yeah but you know

1288
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:45,840
that's you know it's it's fun though you

1289
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:49,620
know yeah it's fun but like in terms of

1290
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:51,870
you know feature films they all have a

1291
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:54,540
purpose and and I can stand confidently

1292
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:56,070
and it would on two feet in front of her

1293
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,420
and say yeah I did that for this reason

1294
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:59,970
I was trying to give these people a

1295
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:01,410
voice and then sometimes it's okay to be

1296
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:03,060
like I really truly believe that

1297
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:06,180
sometimes the answer can be like we

1298
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,800
needed money mm-hmm we everybody needs

1299
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,330
money to survive so I needed to take

1300
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,180
that job because we our family needed

1301
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,819
the money

1302
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:16,059
but um it really but at the same time

1303
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:18,700
I've become kinder I've become more

1304
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:21,640
compassionate I become more sympathetic

1305
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:24,940
and empathetic towards people I'm not

1306
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:29,289
quick to judge I try not to be I try not

1307
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:31,869
to be as judgmental because all that

1308
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:34,270
sort of and also I try not to speak

1309
00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:36,160
really negatively about other people

1310
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:37,660
like it's all changed when you had a

1311
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,480
baby yeah yeah yeah well it's not

1312
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:42,220
overnight but CLE is is true then that

1313
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,900
does change you once you have a kid yeah

1314
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,480
but it's your own personal decision if

1315
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:48,630
you want to change or not um but you

1316
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,220
know I don't want to bring em hmm

1317
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,700
you know I think you've seen me change

1318
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:55,470
over the years

1319
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:57,640
yeah we're talking last night and I

1320
00:53:55,470 --> 00:54:01,599
think before I was a much more

1321
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:02,470
aggressive and you know I look at myself

1322
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,849
now

1323
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:09,039
and I think I I'm not as aggressive in

1324
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:11,230
the sense that I somebody's like I'm not

1325
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:13,299
used before I'd be like oh yeah screw

1326
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:15,220
that guy you know if that guy hey Doug I

1327
00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:17,020
don't do that as much because I don't

1328
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:18,400
want to bring that energy home and I

1329
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:22,119
think that's what the baby does and in

1330
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,289
terms of work some people go in the

1331
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:25,510
direction of like I need to make more

1332
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:27,760
money to give my kid what they need and

1333
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:29,680
then there's the other option which is

1334
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,170
like no no all that stuff doesn't matter

1335
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,329
I think what's more important is helping

1336
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:37,349
molding her to be somebody that you

1337
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:41,230
think will be a great member of society

1338
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:42,809
what's more important is well yeah you

1339
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:45,279
can either try and make more money too

1340
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:46,450
to try to give your kids what you think

1341
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:50,260
they need and then but that my

1342
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:53,140
philosophy is to spend more time with

1343
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:55,240
them and try to you know give them a

1344
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,829
strong foundation you can't make your

1345
00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:00,010
kid become anything they're gonna be who

1346
00:54:56,829 --> 00:55:01,599
they're gonna be and I only my job is to

1347
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:05,069
kind of give them the tools or what I

1348
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:08,589
think is is productive and constructive

1349
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:11,049
for them to go out in the world and it's

1350
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:13,329
on them but but I think that's what

1351
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:18,849
having a kid does it really makes you

1352
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:20,140
think about even who you are and you be

1353
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:22,700
just become you have to become more

1354
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,440
selfless because a kid

1355
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:26,420
they can't care for themselves you have

1356
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:30,799
to care for them so in that way I think

1357
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:33,019
I've become it's less I become less

1358
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:35,420
egotistical you know I think being a

1359
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:39,380
creative and an actor is that one of the

1360
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:40,490
most narcissistic endeavors the one can

1361
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,779
take on because you're just thinking

1362
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:44,660
constantly about yourself and how you

1363
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:48,260
come across and and having a kid really

1364
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:53,150
takes you outside of that and it's less

1365
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:56,000
about like your own sort of hang-ups and

1366
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:58,339
ego which i think is a beautiful thing

1367
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,519
so you guys should have kids yeah so I

1368
00:55:58,339 --> 00:56:03,849
guess when I go pick one up or we can do

1369
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:03,849
one together

1370
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:07,720
[Music]

1371
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:10,640
[Laughter]

1372
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,380
okay well I mean that's that's a good

1373
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,289
way to end off of us so Paco and I are

1374
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:18,349
gonna go get kids yeah again just to

1375
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:21,440

cities after that miss purple is purple

1386
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:48,460
Guk is still on Netflix Netflix but uh

1387
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:51,220
you know Netflix is pretty messed up

1388
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:53,480
they do something I'm not gonna go there

1389
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,759
they do something that's called a pan

1390
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:58,789
and scan we shot that film anamorphic

1391
00:56:55,759 --> 00:57:01,190
which is like yeah what they do is a pan

1392
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:03,500
scan they just they pan and scan it and

1393
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:07,400
they scan it and they cut off the ends

1394
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,930
and they really and they decide when to

1395
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,250
pan so like for example there's that

1396
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,990
shot with the two brothers arguing and

1397
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:15,619
she's in the middle it's cut off at the

1398
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:18,769
ends and they decide when to pan to each

1399
00:57:15,619 --> 00:57:20,660
so I didn't know that watch it on watch

1400
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:22,910
it on Netflix but if you want to see the

1401
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:25,460
