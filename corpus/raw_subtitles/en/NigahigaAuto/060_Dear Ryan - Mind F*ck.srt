1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
here right I challenge you to mind with

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,120
us so you want me to mind then all you

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,230
have to do is say this word the right

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,790
way you don't have to say it out loud

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,679
just read it in your head if you said it

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,000
the way that I said earlier mind then

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,080
you're wrong let me point out why first

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,340
of all you should already know that I

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,929
don't curse to my videos I mean I just

10
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,310
don't see the point in it secondly in

11
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,050
order to trick someone's mind you have

12
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,270
to be fast so fast that their mind can't

13
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,439
keep up I call them fast tricks Astrix

14
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,820
point your mind in another direction

15
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,840
whether you think the direction is right

16
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,519
or wrong you're right because the

17
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,630
direction is right or it's wrong so if

18
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,400
you think that the direction I'm

19
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,689
pointing you in this right know that you

20
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,040
are because you know more about this

21
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,719
equation than you think it may sound

22
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,579
confusing now but the point is I need

23
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,050
you to see let me explain in order to

24
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,850
pull a fast trick on a mind you have to

25
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,660
first know what a mind is a mind is made

26
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,219
of five different things

27
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,200
consciousness perception thought

28
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,850
judgment and memory so in order to pull

29
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,260
faster gonna mind you have to target all

30
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,640
of these points and how do you do that

31
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,200
you've been looking at it the whole time

32
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,360
the first thing you may have missed is

33
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,829
as simple as an Astrid because an Astra

34
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,530
is nothing more than a star and a star

35
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,360
has five points point one consciousness

36
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,190
to be aware were you aware that I gave

37
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,620
you every single point starting with

38
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,570
wine as you said it the way that I said

39
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,040
earlier mind then you're wrong let me

40
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,040
point out wine let me point out why

41
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,549
point to perception or the way you see

42
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,740
something did you really see the point

43
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,970
in it when I said it first of all you

44
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,530
should already know that I don't curse

45
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,360
in my videos I mean I just don't see the

46
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,430
point in it see the point in it to the

47
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,290
poor me the point is I point three

48
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,820
thought I literally told you to think

49
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,619
about which direction I'm leading you in

50
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,390
so if you think that the direction I'm

51
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,869
pointing you in is right know that you

52
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,729
are know that you are all these new or

53
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:37,320
point for judgment based on evidence you

54
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,970
decide something now did you decide to

55
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,850
see everything the way I wanted you to

56
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,820
or did you see around it so the point is

57
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,070
I need you to see

58
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,420
[Music]

59
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,829
point-five memory oh wait that was the

60
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,509
end of what I said right well do you

61
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:53,450
remember the very first point in this

62
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:56,679
video so you want me to mind you no

63
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,880
longer born the point was that you

64
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:02,119
because like I said at the end I need

65
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,890
you to see you are why I see the fash

66
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,810
trick and because the letters you are

67
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,459
why I see are the five points that make

68
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,890
up an aster you now know that this

69
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:15,280
entire video is not a mine because it's

70
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,280
just another simple mine fast trick
