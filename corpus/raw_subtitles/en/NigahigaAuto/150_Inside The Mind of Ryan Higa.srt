know lots of things about him that

120
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,440
nobody knows but they're all secrets

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,040
they're secrets are there any

122
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,479
anything that you can tell us that

123
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,080
nobody knows then yeah

124
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,919
all his secrets okay

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,120
like what exactly um let me think a

126
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,360
little bit oh

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
i know i got a good one go ahead so this

128
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,639
one time we were all in a

129
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
shoot and ryan was sitting in this chair

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,280
and i was right behind him because i was

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
counting on the gross white hairs he was

132
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,160
starting to get

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
and nobody knows this but then he put up

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,479
his phone and i could totally see his

135
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,479
phone screen and i saw that when he

136
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,120
actually opened his phone his passcode

137
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,080
is actually 169 no no regina we can't

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,000
that's not the kind of secrets we're

139
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,680
looking for we can't share that in our

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,280
documentary why not nobody knows it it's

141
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
a good one i'm sure it is a great secret

142
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,479
but maybe something a little less

143
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,840
private than that oh

144
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,639
okay well nobody knows this one but

145
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,360
ever since ryan moved to his new house

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,919
everything

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
changed everything what do you mean by

148
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,320
that exactly

149
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,759
well there's just so many different

150
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,320
things like

151
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,880
his furniture and the paintings on the

152
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,479
wall

153
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,840
and i can tell you right now that the

154
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,120
carpets are completely different from

155
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,479
the enterprise i'll tell you that

156
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,560
those are things people already know but

157
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,880
just by watching his videos i know you

158
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,240
said less private yeah okay but maybe

159
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,720
something a little more private than

160
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,400
that then

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,880
fine i didn't want to talk about this

162
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,840
one but when he moved something else

163
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,080
changed as well

164
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,840
okay and i know for a fact that nobody

165
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,280
knows about this except for his closest

166
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,280
friends but

167
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,360
when he moved he also got a new address

168
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,720
and that address oh okay you know what

169
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,199
just forget it all right

170
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,720
what we can use any of that what do you

171
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,479
want me to say those are the biggest

172
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
juiciest secrets i have about him what

173
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,440
do you want me talking about the boring

174
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,639
ones like the fact that he's only five

175
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,360
eight even though he claims he's five

176
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,880
nine or

177
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
that he got a piano in his house even

178
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,360
though he doesn't know how to play it or

179
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,199
how about the fact that he

180
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,319
has a big drinking problem and nobody

181
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,360
really knows about it except for his

182
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,919
closest friend

183
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,360
wait wait hold on back up what do you

184
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,120
want me to do back up hold on

185
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,639
you just said ryan has a big drinking

186
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,800
problem uh yeah why

187
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,400
oh sure are you that that's completely

188
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160

getting back to what you were talking

193
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,600
about you were saying he actually does

194
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,960

197
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,600
i've seen it with my own eyes and ears

198
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,199
that's very bad why else do you think he

199
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
has all those wet spots on his shirt and

200
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,960
why

201
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
i don't like to wear socks to his house

202
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,520
anymore because every time i go there

203
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,039
there's little puddles all over the

204
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,280
place and i like to step in it and it

205
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,479
gets all wet and my socks get whispered

206
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
wait what does that have to do with his

207
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,960
drinking problem because he's always

208
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,479
spilling what are you stupid

209
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,919
like i don't know what his problem is

210
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,960
but it's not that hard to drink things

211
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,000
i've been doing this since i was like

212
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,199
five years old so that's

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
what you meant when you said he has a

214
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,599
big drinking problem that he spills a

215
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,000
little

216
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,199

229
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,479

235
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,120

270
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,519
have goosebumps or anything to indicate

271
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
you have

272
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,399
okay you know what you can't see a

273
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,480
feeling but did you see what i just felt

274
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,040
just now when i saw what i felt

275
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,440
what does that even mean i think we're

276
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,320
dealing with something

277
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,000
a lot worse than what we thought okay we

278
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,600
literally just met him and he seems

279
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,959
completely normal to me okay you don't

280
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
think it's weird that he just

281
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,160
snuck up on us almost as if he was

282
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
planning for us to be right in this spot

283
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,600
no we told him we were going to be heard

284
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,440
a specific time and we did just that so

285
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,800
no it's completely okay what about the

286
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,560
aggressive behavior the way he just

287
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,920
shoved his hand out at us show like oh

288
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,360
i'm the dominant he shook

289
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,880
your hand he shook your hand that's

290
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,640
completely normal getting chose again

291
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
just thinking about his face did you not

292
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,680
see the way he smiles like a psychotic

293
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
person his mouth gets all whiter his

294
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,160
eyes are squinty and no no just stop

295
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,760
okay

296
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,360
i know you want this documentary to be

297
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,920
all entertaining and dramatic but

298
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
you can't fake it okay you can't all

299
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,760
that's happened so far is we've shown up

300
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,160
at a specific time which we gave him

301
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,839
we met him you shook his hand and that's

302
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,360
it by the way if you think his face is

303
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,959
suspicious that means your face is

304
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,000
suspicious because guess what you've got

305
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,560
the same face

306
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,560
same face

307
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,640
wow that is

308
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,920
the most racist thing i've heard all

309
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,120
week

310
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,600
what i i'm very disappointed okay that's

311
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
not how i meant it in any way seriously

312
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,560

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200

361
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,200
conversation asking about mental illness

362
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,320
how would you have started it then i

363
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,120

364
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
right

365
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,680
who cares about the weather okay i

366
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,279
thought we were here to find out if he

367
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,320
was one of those like crazy stuff

368
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,519
social sociopaths

369
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,120
okay and i'm not gonna be able to

370
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,160
evaluate him if he's uncomfortable and

371
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,720
he doesn't open up to us do you

372
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720

40 degree temperatures yeah it's been

396
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,000

403
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,680
place the grocery store don't you think

404
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,399

407
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,519
magazines

408
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,040
like let alone a new issue every single

409
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,480
month right

410
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,839
what are you doing like what do they do

411
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
with the old issues when the new ones

412
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,079
come out

413
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,680
what are they doing i'm sorry is this

414
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,040
like some kind of comedy bit you're

415
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,120
working on no no just

416
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,560
casual conversation you know i just you

417
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,480
guys never wondered what happens to the

418
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,120
old issues when the new ones come off

419
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,519
no i i can't say that i have i imagine

420
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,560
they recycle them

421
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,440
oh well um i guess since we are on the

422
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,680
topic of both

423
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,160
old and new issues what are yours

424
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,160
exactly

425
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,519
what okay seriously you need to stop

426
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,560
what it came up naturally this time okay

427
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,079
i don't even know if the rest of this

428
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,519
interview is even salvageable at this

429
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,199
point but if you want to grab anything

430
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,760
else at all you let me do the rest of

431
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,560
the talking

432
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
understand fine fine but all i'm trying

433
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,160
to do

434
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,880
is warn you okay he he really knows how

435
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,160
to steer

436
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,920
a conversation it's like

437
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,639
that gas stove or is that electric um

438
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,680
i'm pretty sure it's gas yeah he is

439
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,680
incredibly

440
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,360
manipulative and when i look into his

441
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,959
eyes i see

442
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,160
this darkness you know the part that's

443
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,839
supposed to be colored in the middle

444
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,600
there's this little circle of darkness

445
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,079
that's just his eyes that's how eyes are

446
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,880
shaved and colorized yeah i think he's

447
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,079
one of those things

448
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,399
what things i think he's anemic that's

449
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,519
really

450
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,720
that it is exactly what it is see he

451
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,839
already got tired

452
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,839
i think that's what happened

453
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:08,000
let me do i have to go pee too

454
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:13,279

455
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,800
so okay i'm sorry

456
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,199

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,600

458
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,600
that's it

459
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,160
sorry about that again yeah we had some

460
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,680
camera issues to work out and

461
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,360
you know it was just getting really

462
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,120
messed up look guys

463
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,040
i know what's going on okay you guys

464
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,519
don't have to be so sneaky about it like

465
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,720
i will be completely honest and answer

466
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,480
all your questions

467
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,759
as long as you guys do the same for me

468
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,000
because if not why are we doing this

469
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,600
right

470
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,199
there's no point that sounds fair to me

471
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,560
totally um but we were

472
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,560
being honest there really was a problem

473
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,360
with the cameras that we had to fix

474
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,720
right well this like weird error message

475
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,680
popped up on the uh

476
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,000
viewfinder screen on the camera saying

477
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,040
that the lens aperture lens aperture was

478
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,079
corrupted by the shutter speed exposure

479
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,839
on the memory card white balance iso

480
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,279
okay that's not even remotely true there

481
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,920
were no camera issues no it really said

482
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,800
that the lens

483
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,079
aperture lens aperture well then why did

484
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,279

512
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,280
um are you hearing i'm only here

513
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,439
because i feel broken okay is that what

514
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,959
you want to hear me say

515
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:22,160
fine i'm saying it i feel broken

516
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,240
i'm broken i mean i mean i've been doing

517
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,039
this for over 12 years you know it's a

518
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,319
long time

519
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,919
it really is um

520
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,000
and i know i don't normally you know

521
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,720
jump on trends and just do

522
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,880
things because it works um but

523
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,840
you know i'm just so i'm just so tired

524
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,280
you know

525
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,600
so tired you're tired

526
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,000
and so you compromised your own values

527
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,000
and basically made a subpar documentary

528
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
piggybacking off the success of shane

529
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,960
dawson's series just

530
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,520
because you thought it would be easy

531
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,200
views but documentaries only succeed

532
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,080
when people know they're real

533
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
and now you're realizing that you

534
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,679
haven't been real

535
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,840
for a very long time have you i

536
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,799
i don't know i mean i i don't know um

537
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,320
but you do

538
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,640
because you're finally looking at

539
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,559
yourself and seeing the real you

540
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,160
the you that was hiding behind all the

541
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,160
other personas you've created over the

542
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,360
years to hide behind personas like

543
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,520
what are you even i don't know what

544
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,440
you're talking about i think maybe

545
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,039
we should take a little break right now

546
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,360
this is a good spot see there's the

547
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,520
happy funny version of you that uses

548
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,200
comedy as a defense mechanism to show

549
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,200
that nothing really affects you

550
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,799
then there's the most normal persona the

551
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,320
one that you use to show that everything

552
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,760
is just fine in your life despite

553
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,919
everything going on in your head

554
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,440
there's the silly obnoxious one one that

555
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,080
thinks they're smarter than everyone

556
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,919
oblivious

557
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,520
to the fact that everyone sees right

558
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,360
through them and how incredibly dumb

559
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,960
they really are and there's just so many

560
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,480
others that people don't really see or

561
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,039
know about but you've created

562
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,280
all of them for the exact same purpose

563
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,280
to hide and protect the real one

564
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,840
the broken one the one that nobody

565
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,640
