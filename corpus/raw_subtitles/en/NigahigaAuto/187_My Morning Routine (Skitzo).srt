26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,310
routine it's almost night well I didn't

27
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,570
say it was a fast routine there's a lot

28
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,860
of stuff for us girls to do in the

29
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,780

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,350

35
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,280

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,119

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,910

47
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,140

51
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,030
I did they won't cook right but that's

52
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:13,850
not a storm you know what Regina can you

53
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:15,620
just please go oh sure we just go my

54
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:19,370
morning routine goes a little something

55
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:21,230
like this so the first thing I do in the

56
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,060
morning is wake up I usually turn wake

57
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,220
up early like around 12:00 or 1:00 p.m.

58
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,110
but lately I've been waking up even

59
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,940
earlier like 11 a.m. from the cold

60
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,860
because my stupid boyfriend steals all

61
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,450
the blankets from me so I yell at him

62
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,010
and he just ignores me the whole time

63
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,650
and continues to sleep which makes me

64
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,840
really sad so I cry for about five to

65
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,730
ten minutes before I realized that wait

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,799
I don't have a boyfriend so I get over

67
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,540
it and that's when I hit to the bathroom

68
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:46,250
where the real fun begins I do all the

69
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,160
boring stuff first like turn on the

70
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,769
shower brush my teeth brush my hairs my

71
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,360
little push down stairs and by that time

72
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,920
the showers steamy enough for me to

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,350
write my name in it so that I can take a

74
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,049
picture for in stores and snappies then

75
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,910
comes the fun part my mega I always

76
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,950
start with my foundation which if you

77
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,170
don't know is pretty much just power so

78
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,720
any kind of powder works but personally

79
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,470
I use flour because I love flowers then

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,210
look and smell

81
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,130
beautiful and once I finished that I'd

82
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,200
do my lips I know most girls like using

83
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,000
these coloring sticks but I prefer to

84
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,260
lip tint which is a technique that's

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,660
really popular in other countries

86
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,460
outside of Nevada or basically all you

87
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,350
do is put some fruit punch or grape

88
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,510
juice whatever color you want in a bowl

89
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,580
and just dip your lips for two maybe

90
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,290
three or four hours and you're done and

91
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,570
ready to do your eyes now some people

92
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,980
call it eyeliner some say eyeshadow but

93
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,840
really it doesn't matter because they're

94
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,550
all the same thing and basically it's

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,650
just the coloring of your eyeball

96
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,240
section again I know most girls like to

97
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,340
cover their eyes with coloring sticks

98
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,590
but I'm really not like that typical

99
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,959
basic batch so I like to use the fancier

100
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,790
foreign brands like Crayola which stays

101
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,620
on pretty nicely or like sharp piece

102
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,290
which is actually waterproof and won't

103
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,670
come off when you swim cry or even scrub

104
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,200
for an hour and if you can't afford

105
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,880
those I found that you know those little

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,590
black balls that everybody gets every

107
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,090
Christmas works really well I believe

108
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,500
that brand is called shark wall or

109
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,480
something but that works too

110
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,800
and after that I'm pretty much done and

111
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,450
ready to get the day started

112
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,910
so I leave the bathroom and that's when

113
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,760
I always see my blankets on my bed move

114
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,350
so I go over there thinking wait maybe I

115
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,330
do have a boyfriend

116
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,519
but when I check and remove the covers

117
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,680
it's not my boyfriend at all it's me

118
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,300
under there I see myself sleeping and

119
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,250
that's when I realized I was asked you

120
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,169
projecting the whole time so then I just

121
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,330
wake myself up by pulling off the cover

122
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,169
so that I get really cold wake up and do

123
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:36,979
it all over again

124
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:41,060
ah so would you guys say that was long

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:43,130

138
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:12,229
question stupid anyway my morning starts

139
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,990

build troops raid other building stuff

143
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:26,089

00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:33,979
pad to the 12 hour mark and back to the

147
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:36,080
basics that jump right back on that

148
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,800
and repeat before I know it it's nice

149
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,449
then I just do it all over again

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,309

my routine goes a little something like

163
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:18,560
please every morning I wake up afraid

164
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:21,290
afraid for my life gunfire screams for I

165
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,120
know what I hear banging on door someone

166
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,860
trying to break in that's when I grab

167
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:30,830
the guns I keep under my pillow and

168
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:33,919
count down four three two one

169
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,930
I fire the moment that door opens before

170
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,479
I can even get a good look at who it is

171
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,000
as I'm about to leave her realized I

172
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,639
know this man he's my father

173
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,160
tears start coming down my face like a

174
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,900
waterfall being chased by the TLC and I

175
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,090
just wrote get in my car and head

176
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,950
straight to my psychologist in ten years

177
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,930
because I don't know who else to talk to

178
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,479
I tell him the whole story and he tells

179
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,090

183
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,750
don't know if I should feel happy or

184
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,550
betrayed and I just closed my eyes and

185
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,850
black out when I hope and then I found

186
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,650
my psychologist my father dead I shot

187
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,479
him I hear sirens coming that's when I

188
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,030
get back in my car and start driving

189
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,010
again tears are coming down my face like

190
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,080
a kpop star in that movie ninja

191
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,330
assassins like rain and it blurs my

192
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,100
vision right as an old lady crossing the

193
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,289
street a slamming mob breaks I lose

194
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,870
control of the car and hit her - no hope

195
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,030
lady I get out run over to her to see

196
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,250
that she's barely alive then down next

197
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,320
to her not able to convey how sorry I am

198
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,280
when she stops me she tells me to come

199
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,500
closer and she whispers I forgive you

200
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,780
son and that's when I realized this

201
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,570
innocent old lady I killed wasn't not

202
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,789
