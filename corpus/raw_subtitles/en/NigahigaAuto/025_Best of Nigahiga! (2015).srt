16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,739
hey guys that would be weird

00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,520
at least one really big video and it

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,140
always like it ties up all my time and I

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,699
always want to make this video but I

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,229
never get the chance to while I have the

29
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,180
chance and I have a spare moment today

31
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,720
video before I have no time but before

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,100

33
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,830
want to talk to you guys directly and

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,350
say uh thank you guys so much can

35
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,610
honestly say 2015 was a great year a lot

36
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,650
of you guys already know but like a

37
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,659
couple years ago I was I was going

38
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,090
through a really rough stretch and doing

39
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,460
this for like eight years nine years now

40
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,960
and I was you know eventually it gets to

41
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,040
you coming up with a new thing every

42
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,930
single week is not eating I was

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,979
literally going crazy for a little bit

44
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,540
you know I was worried about saying

45
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,920
things that would offend people is

46
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,570
worried about doing too many blogs like

47
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,009
this because more people want the skits

48
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,420
and when I do too many skits more people

49
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,340
want the vlogs like I was just stressing

50
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,869
myself out way too much worried about

51
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,430
what everybody else wanted except for

52
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,259
myself but this year from the beginning

53
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,490
of the year I just decided that I'm

54
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,049
gonna let go of all of it I just went

55
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,970
back to my roots and created videos that

56
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,740
I wanted to create videos that nobody

57
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,780
liked I made videos that were offensive

58
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,610
to be my main videos that you know we're

59
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,810
30 minutes long that is probably the

60
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,520
stupidest decision you could ever make

61
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,469
on YouTube because for one who's gonna

62
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,210
sit through that but even doing all of

63
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,280
that stuff you know even doing every

64
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,060
single thing I wanted to do posting

65
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,429
controversial videos of 30 minute video

66
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,870
the best thing about this year is that

67
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,700
you guys are still here

68
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,100

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,050
really grateful and you have you have no

70
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,490

71
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,020

72
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:28,100
