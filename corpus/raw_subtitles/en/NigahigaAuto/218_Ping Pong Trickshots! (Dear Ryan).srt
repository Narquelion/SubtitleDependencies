00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,710
dear Ryan can you do a ping pong trick

99
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:32,370
shot you actually think we're gonna do

100
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,370
another trick shot video yeah yeah

101
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,120
[Applause]

102
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:12,569
so I know you must be a little confused

103
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,339
now because of the title you know saying

104
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,740
that they were fails when clearly you

105
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,089
know her don't know why I'm talking like

106
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,649
this well you see ever since we did our

107
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:21,449
first trickshot video we've been getting

108
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:23,729
a lot of crazy requests to do a bunch of

109
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,869
other ones some are repeats clearly they

110
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,309
haven't seen that we already did those

111
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:28,080
and there's also some crazy ones like

112
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:29,429
these like throwing knives and and bow

113
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,809
and arrow trick shots dangerous ones

114
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:32,610
well the reason why I pick ping-pong

115
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:34,649
balls over all the other great options

116
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:49,080
is because you know I learned my lesson

117
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:50,909
from the other ones we broke a lot of

118
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,169
things and people did get hurt and

119
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:53,759
that's why I picked ping-pong balls

120
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,709
because they're safe and they're light

121
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,899
and you know they're nothing's gonna get

122
00:06:55,709 --> 00:07:00,899
broken from a little light ping-pong

123
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:03,649
ball is what I told myself before we

124
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:03,649
started doing this

125
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,639
