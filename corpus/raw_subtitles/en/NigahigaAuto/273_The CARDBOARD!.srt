1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
first there was the board then there was

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,390
the skateboard then there was the

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:16,980
skateboard with steering and now for the

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:19,380
first time ever it's here the cardboard

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,449
the cardboard also known as the cyborg

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,289
air board rowing device is the future of

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,119
Transportation

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,340
why walk then you could be not walking

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,109
step after step after step aren't you

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,910
sick of it yet and you rather just be on

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,710
wheels all the time well with the

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,930
cardboard you'll never not not be on

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,760
wheels again so what would it cost

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,350
similar products will cost you an arm

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,420
and a leg but thanks to the cardboards

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,100
advanced design will cost you any body

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,809
parts at all just cash and did we

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,579
mention that the cardboard is completely

19
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,410
customizable of course we haven't we're

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,180
only at that part now the cardboard is

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,590
completely customized you'll never have

22
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,449
the same cardboard as someone else with

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,570
our crazy selection of colors such as

24
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,449
brown dark brown faded brown shiny brown

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,129
Tara Brown eye brown hot brown Cleveland

26
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,680
Brown and for the really daring you can

27
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,360
even get it in red yellow or blue all

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,130
mixed together to create a nice

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,600
prominent Brown but that's not all

30
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,520
you'll also be able to customize the

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
safety straps as well not to mention the

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,310
headlights and taillights too so how

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,140
does it work now I know what you're

34
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,700
thinking the cardboard literally defies

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,950
gravity so it doesn't really work well

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,840
the answer is simple definitely maybe it

37
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,340
might you see gravity is nothing more

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,350
than a science book and so is the word

39
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,509
oxygen also known as o2 to most

40
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,490
scientists meaning there's two O's tools

41
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,200
and tools are what makes things were

42
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,939
moving that the cardboard indeed were

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,979
noisy place the cardboard wouldn't defy

44
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,049
gravity is in space because there's no

45
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,909
oxygen so how can you get the cardboard

46
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,320
unfortunately it's not available we've

47
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,820
been having a really hard time funding

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,350
our Kickstarter campaign because of all

49
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,970
the homophobic comments or trolls they

50
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,500

51
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,360
