1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
I've wrestled people who smell like [ __ ]

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:09,240
like literal like poop the last two

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,360
years like two years ago we did decent I

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:19,560
don't know maybe like 150 K for the year

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:21,090
and then last year we did like 250 K are

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,730
you having class please do that for

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:30,449
claps yeah yeah I guess that makes sense

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,099
that we usually yeah I mean it is a

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,899
weird thing even when we first put it on

10
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,750
we're like all hearing yourself is such

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,670
a weird you know like you take it but

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,680
you're not you do it haunting yourself

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,690
or like listening to your division it's

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,280
different when it's alive - yeah I guess

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,600
so and especially it's worse if there's

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,550
a little bit of a delay this is the

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,920

here now we're on a travel blog

49
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,890
full-time and for the past six years

50
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,360
we've been moving to a new city every

51
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,880
year to write about the city

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,280
um the surrounding area nomads nomads

53
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,210
it's kind of this one a nomad is right

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,010
somebody who doesn't have a like yeah

55
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,950
yeah this is long as they please for a

56
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:40,690
while you guys are gypsies yeah yep

57
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,040
basically and he's pretty humble but

58
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,390
their blog is like one of the biggest

59
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,000
right travel vlogs

60
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,770
yeah it's if not the biggest travel blog

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,110
not the biggest but it's it's the

62
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,330
biggest travel what's up there yes it is

63
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,459
Vegas yeah I'm just saying it's the

64
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,530
local adventurer local adventurer I

65
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,180
don't normally read blogs but like like

66
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,100
you were saying cuz I was asking we were

67
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,160
talking about this beforehand yeah I

68
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,160
thought your fan base was just like like

69
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,660
a really small dedicated not small but

70
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,580
very dedicated fan base but you were

71
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,320
saying that a lot of times it's it's

72
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,600
just people constantly coming in and

73
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,769
checking all random articles and yeah I

74
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,200
mean I think it's partly because of the

75
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:19,180
way we built the blog when Esther

76
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,440
started it it was primarily because she

77
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,160
couldn't find the information that she

78
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,620
wanted uh-huh so she's neither of us are

79
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,130
like we're not great writers we don't

80
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,200
really like writing like stories per se

81
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,390
but we like to find information and give

82
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,700
that information to people so that's

83
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,260
kind of how the site was built and so I

84
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,140
think it's more of a resource than it is

85
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:47,250
like people following our personal lives

86
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:50,350
right yeah what's so funny all right

87
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,959
Jacob we're cool right yeah all right

88
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,970
you know if I throw out some some small

89
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,510
burns here and there then what do you do

90
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:00,310
just just keep moving on keep moving

91
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,750
yeah yeah no I don't know I had last

92
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,360
time with the Kevin thing there's a lot

93
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,010
of people were like I don't like that

94
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,010
punk was going after Kevin like that

95
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,110
they're probably not gonna defend me as

96
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,630
much it'll probably make the don't think

97
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,920
you're you're a jerk or dick or whatever

98
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,269
it sounds funny I think it was pretty

99
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,250
apparent that you guys really yeah but

100
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,160
there's some people who are dumb I think

101
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,110
you just just get very

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,790
offended but not I just get surprised

103
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,650
that there are people that you get wrong

104
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,330
you're pretty sensitive I'm not I'm

105
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,790
hardest look at this body

106
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:34,110
dude ah I went to gym once this week

107
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,000
with that being said I guess we're

108
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,710
jumping back into I don't remember cuz

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,880
you know poor it laughing yeah they're

110
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,680
right I met Jacob and I met you I met

111
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,090
Jacob on internet icon

112
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,870
yeah sure that we did that was basically

113
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,770
like American Idol but for Hubert yeah

114
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,750
yeah I guess yeah at the time especially

115
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,310
and that's where I met Paco as well but

116
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:04,830
the following season we only did two

117
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:06,870
seasons and and and J and Jacob was a

118
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:13,380
finalist with his brother no he well I

119
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:17,340
wasn't a final what did you get I got

120
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:19,410
fourth but we both got eliminated

121
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,560
basically on the same episode right

122
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,350
before the finals kiss season 2 had

123
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,880
three finalists yeah yeah I don't

124
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,070
remember if I voted to get rid of you

125
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,530
guys or not yeah I don't remember I

126
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,540
don't know I think it was Kassim it

127
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,910
might it might be I don't think he liked

128
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,950
us I think he liked Lana and the right

129
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,360
elves were kind of a shoo-in right elves

130
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,890
were killing it yeah the rhinos were

131
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,300
shooting so it was between us and Lana

132
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,800
and I think he just like Lana better

133
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,340
PewDiePie didn't like me because he's a

134
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,350
racist and and he just hates me

135
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,540
now that's we're gonna screen cap that

136
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,770
put that in the intro hey we got you

137
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,390
know what you're I didn't want to be on

138
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,450
this podcast so we're gonna cause drama

139
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,919
for um say didn't want to be on it no he

140
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,890
did actually he responded to the tweets

141
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,630
what tweets wait up he just straight up

142
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,520
said no thanks well he was kind of like

143
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,490
what he said is he doesn't want to be on

144
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,210
podcast because we asked him to be on

145
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,669
the podcast

146
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,320
see now now you're revealing who runs

147
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:17,310
the Twitter I know I'm not revealing

148
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,230
it's not me but you're narrowing it down

149
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,030
it's pretty obvious that it's not me

150
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,950
writing the Twitter I get that I see it

151
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,390
after the fact when it gets narrowed

152
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,840
down to oh these are good questions for

153
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,870
so-and-so

154
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,030
yeah but basically the the whoever is

155
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,350
handling the Twitter was like oh yeah

156
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,009
would you like to be on the podcast and

157
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:37,639
eat on one of his videos

158
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:39,830
he saw it and basically like roasted it

159
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,139
was like wow you're pretty much saying

160
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,520
that your fans want me to be on the

161
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,529
podcast but not you

162
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,509
it is just like damn that's very true

163
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:50,869
and also he was like he doesn't want to

164
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:53,059
do a podcast because like media will

165
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:54,619
take things and like twist it in a way

166
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:57,139
and you know he just don't want to be

167
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:59,419
responsible he just gets done by yeah

168
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,740
yeah exactly so that's why he's like I

169
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,330
don't wanna do it he has to be very

170
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,349
careful with what he says which is very

171
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,990
understandable

172
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:08,599
people always yeah that's how I argue

173
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,490
that's how we were an internet icon we

174
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,930
and like Josh and I had this

175
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,939
conversation before you guys started

176
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,699
filming like they can take anything we

177
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:19,039
say and twist it yep we should just make

178
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:23,089
sure we're always super nice but then we

179
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,339
got cut out of everything because that's

180
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:28,669
how reality shows work but don't realize

181
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:31,189
like even the most realistic ones it's

182
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,330
there's no real reality show oh yeah

183
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,860
other than being like I mean like

184
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,899
YouTube like vlogging and then even then

185
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,159
you don't know for sure that it's being

186
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:38,270
like a hundred percent real you don't

187
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,490
know what they're cutting you don't know

188
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,669
if they're acting but most reality shows

189
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,319
it's like unless you're crazy or you

190
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:46,969
know that's usually how they get you

191
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,249
that that's how you get screen time yep

192
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:50,719
but I'm gonna cause drama

193
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:52,309
yeah I've witnessed that when we were

194
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:54,169
filming that show I wouldn't stat

195
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:55,939
firsthand I was like oh this is so

196
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,919
interesting because we had producers and

197
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:01,039
stuff and directors that have done this

198
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,809
before and I was just like so interested

199
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,240
in like their their discussions is like

200
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:08,089
how can we throw a wrench into like

201
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,199
things are going too well for people how

202
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:11,199
can we throw a wrench into I was like

203
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,430
wow that so this is how it works this is

204
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,309
interested they specifically talk crap

205
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,689
about anybody um I don't remember it was

206
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:19,519
probably the earlier episodes because

207
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:21,050
search the ending it was like the people

208
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,659
that were great for the show and that

209
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,069
we're good you know it wasn't like fan

210
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,229
voting because that would have been too

211
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:29,209
costly to have to have live fat boats

212
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:31,430
yeah figuring that stuff out so it was

213
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:33,680
based on like the judges and none of

214
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,260
that was fake like we actually came to a

215
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,940
consensus but then they would have a say

216
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,940
- they they would give their

217
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,039
recommendations like this guy is like so

218
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:47,540
not good on camera or this person is a

219
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:50,850
you know really good yeah

220
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,529
so what was your impression on of Paco I

221
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,180
was the one I was on like to him

222
00:08:52,529 --> 00:09:00,000
initially you know because I didn't

223
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:01,710
really know him yeah I I'm editing this

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,330
so I can just cut it you could write

225
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:08,940
that boy you could I could just watch

226
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:11,010
put it back I mean I mean I liked them

227
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,630
they were you guys were on the show so

228
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:17,460
obviously I liked you guys actually no

229
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:21,330
you guys did really well yeah to a guest

230
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:24,690
I mean what not it would do really well

231
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:26,250
yeah so I mean you're currently still

232
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,779
doing this blog it's very successful I

233
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,860
saw yeah I found this so interesting

234
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,930
because I want to go check it out

235
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,910
because obviously I wanted to do some

236
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,490
research you know really read blogs but

237
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,960
I find it really interesting that you

238
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,650
posted you guys post your earnings we do

239
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,040
this past month

240
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,230
you made $21,000 well a little more than

241
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,970
that off just doing that blog have

242
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,210
sponsorships and they show their whole

243
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,410
breakdown they show your costs I think

244
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,270
and I thought that was like that's

245
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,120
fascinating for one like why did you

246
00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:03,870
decide to to show that because it's very

247
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:05,310
private thing and then also how are not

248
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,990
the easiest thing to get around you know

249
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:13,770
I mean like it's very specific also are

250
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:14,910
you hiring yeah but usually people you

251
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,570
know it's funny it's like we make these

252
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,310
same jokes

253
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:22,160
yeah but then like when guests make it

254
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:24,750
it's like well it's all adding up it's

255
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,020
very hard future employer

256
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:32,900
I'd watch this go ahead we're looking

257
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,900
for like you know the Gregg quality like

258
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,680
yeah so we we were really it took us it

259
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,050
was a lot of debate over sharing our

260
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,089
income reports every month but I think

261
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,339
the idea was we wanted to show other

262
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:49,440
aspiring bloggers how we do what we do

263
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,600
right and so it was supposed to be a

264
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,430
resource yeah it's a really private

265
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,430
thing and we don't want to post it to be

266
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,560
like bragging about anything didn't come

267
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,390
across anything that sort is really to

268
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,770
show because I think there's a we get

269
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,270
the question a lot like

270
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,770
how are you guys doing this full-time or

271
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,230
what are you and I'm sure you get that

272
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,000
question as like a youtuber like anymore

273
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,010
yeah I guess it's more common back in

274
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,690
the day when I can make money all the

275
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,830
time for blogs it's still pretty a

276
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,950
mystery you know

277
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:19,440
yeah so it's uh we we posted it up just

278
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,630
really for that reason to show people it

279
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,820
can be done because I really believe

280
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,520
that people can do what they want and

281
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,250
chase their dreams in like a responsible

282
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:32,880
way that's a very nice thing to say

283
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,530
yeah but you know what though I mean I I

284
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,450
found cuz I read I read that one and I

285
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,700
was interesting cuz you or I don't know

286
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,140
a faster wrote it but you were talking

287
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,810
about like initially so when did you

288
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,390
guys I guess what I'm asking is when did

289
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,130
you start and then how did it okay

290
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,220
because initially you she said you would

291
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,450
you made like 50 bucks in a month we

292
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,770
made them wants nothing at the beginning

293
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,810
and primarily because we didn't know how

294
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,850
to make money right so Esther started

295
00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,320
the blog actually when we moved to LA to

296
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:05,250
do YouTube so Esther was doing was at

297
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,960
2013 okay relatively recent yeah so she

298
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,400
started too then because we she had a

299
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,590
wedding photography business before that

300
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,780
and we left Atlanta she was looking for

301
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,090
something new to do and just started to

302
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,460
post about our travels because we just

303
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,510
like to travel and then she realized

304
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,420
that people were doing this full-time

305
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,740
and so started doing some research of

306
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,720
like okay how do I do this more

307
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,790
strategically and be smart about it and

308
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,610
so started to build that up and then

309
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,130
when we moved to Vegas the first time

310
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:34,800
that's when like there's they're good

311
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,330
like just a little snowball effect right

312
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,010
like there was there are more people

313
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,040
finding the blog it was getting a bigger

314
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:43,050
audience and she's amazing on the

315
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,390
backend creative side but needed help on

316
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,530
the business side so that's when I see

317
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,820
you YouTube and then decided to help oh

318
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,830
so when that was going that was like

319
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,930
what what year was money for remembering

320
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,020
yeah 2014 20 did you guys just we're

321
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,810
just leaving Vegas yeah yeah we when

322
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,040
Josh stayed right so what at what I mean

323
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,200
if it's not to person I guess it's not

324
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,540
personal you're posting about it yeah in

325
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,640
that first when you that first month

326
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,240
when you decided to stop doing YouTube

327
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,330
what was your income at that point

328
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,610
honestly I don't remember then

329
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,260
it was definitely not enough to be

330
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,570
sustainable right but that's why it's

331
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,560
interesting because to take that leap ya

332
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,330
know to go in a completely different

333
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,060
direction in something that's not making

334
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:29,090
anything really we saw I think it's just

335
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,340
that I saw the potential and we so this

336
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:34,160
is the same with YouTube we we didn't

337
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:36,260
make a crazy amount of money but we made

338
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,240
enough to make a living off of it right

339
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,120
for two years especially if you live in

340
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,560
Vegas yes Vegas is so much cheaper

341
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,750
Atlanta the same it's about the same

342
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,660
yeah yeah

343
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,480
California is way too expensive yeah but

344
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,130
we gave ourselves a year initially when

345
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,350
we moved to LA to say like if we can

346
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,120
make enough money to make a living then

347
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,620
we'll try again for another year and

348
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,180
then we came out to Vegas to do the same

349
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,560
thing and we weren't really seeing the

350
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,120
growth that we wanted to so that's what

351
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,770
I'm talking about like it's good to

352
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,270
chase your dreams but be realistic about

353
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:07,100
it because we basically give ourselves

354
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,070
the time frame of like okay we have

355
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,080
enough savings to pursue it for a year

356
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,150
beyond that you know it's not really

357
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,340
responsible for us to do it anymore

358
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:19,550
we talked about a very similar thing to

359
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,110
before in the past about like I think

360
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,200
what the question was like aspiring to

361
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,910
be a youtuber yeah oh yeah yeah oh it's

362
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,710
like the same thing we were saying like

363
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,970
we don't want to be the people it ended

364
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,530
up sounding like don't follow your

365
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,690
dreams but it was like the point of like

366
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,820
be smart about it

367
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:38,000
and no like you have to weigh out the

368
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,650
risk like if I had quit YouTube yeah

369
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,770
right and when I was in college and at

370
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,360
the time we weren't getting paid really

371
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,250
then you have to realize my mom made me

372
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,960
realize like hey all your friends will

373
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,940
be graduated I mean you have to come

374
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,800
back and be with a bunch of kids ya know

375
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,630
so it's like you weigh out the positives

376
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,300
and negatives so for you guys like did

377
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,980
you have a fallback plan um so I think

378
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,020
we've just always had the mentality that

379
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,970
worst case scenario we can go back and

380
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,650
get regular jobs right you know when it

381
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,150
comes down to it I don't have an issue

382
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,860
getting back to I used to work a

383
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,380
corporate job I can go back to a

384
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,420
corporate job if I need to so in the

385
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,280
blog when I when I end up quitting and

386
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,900
helping Esther where the blog we still

387
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,700
had you know we calculated we had enough

388
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:20,270
savings to do like a year and a half two

389
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:22,190
years of like living conservatively to

390
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,770
see if we can make it happen and then

391
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,110
that was about when it broke for us like

392
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,690
the tipping point of it

393
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,690
doing well so the last two years like

394
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,740
two years ago we did decent I don't know

395
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:38,980
maybe like 150 K for the year and then

396
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,740
last year we did like 250 K so we were

397
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,660
able to grow and scale the business and

398
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,269
then in terms of how it's just I think

399
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,899
it's like YouTube in terms of it it's a

400
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:50,110
numbers game

401
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:51,730
so for us we have a decent amount of

402
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,320
people visiting the site every month so

403
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,420
we're able to make money off ad revenue

404
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,579
but then we also do sponsorships and

405
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,829
then like a small percentage off

406
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:02,140
affiliate sales so that's like if you

407
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:04,800
were if we tell you hey we bought ninja

408
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,329
milk on Amazon and give you our link and

409
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,709
Paco goes to buy it it's still the same

410
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:10,510
price for Paco but we make a small

411
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,399
percentage of that right because you're

412
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,350
still bringing people to this thing and

413
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,060
and you're putting your stamp on it

414
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,829
yes entually and your stamp is valuable

415
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,410
now so I was wondering about that

416
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:22,630
because what if have you ever have you

417
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:26,050
ever endorsed anything or about a place

418
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:27,910
that you did not a hundred percent like

419
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,800
let's say you did oh completely loved it

420
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,480
especially at the beginning oh really

421
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,750
yeah because at the beginning when when

422
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,160
you it's like I bet you can remember

423
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,410
like brand deals early on definitely

424
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,750
where you're just excited for the first

425
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,810
brand deal I think the biggest regret we

426
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:46,149
had was Bud Light Lime really good yeah

427
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,920
we got that and we're like we hadn't

428
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:51,430
even tried it we tried it work this is

429
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,899
disgusting I put my Bud Light Lime

430
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,550
really I just you know I wouldn't drink

431
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:58,000
a lot of it yeah I mean like I don't

432
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,949
mind it I hated it like we but like for

433
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,269
me it's like I also signed a contract so

434
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:03,190
I was gonna be professional about yeah

435
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,959
I'm gonna do it I don't think we wrote

436
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,890
raving reviews about it but we also

437
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,669
didn't say we did it right you know

438
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:14,350
here's a new thing yeah exactly

439
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:16,299
what didn't you like I think I wouldn't

440
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:19,030
know if I was reading I was like oh yeah

441
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:21,520
I'm sure you know yeah I'm sure if you

442
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,949
go back I think it's still on our site

443
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,020
you could probably tell that we didn't

444
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,790
like it really but yeah I think it's

445
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,040
like lessons learned you know we learned

446
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,890
okay we shouldn't endorse products that

447
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,140
we don't like because it just ruins the

448
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,710
integrity exactly yeah I had to learn

449
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,830
that too

450
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,620
yeah the hard way but I mean it was even

451
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,659
more so

452
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,610
like back in the day on YouTube we're

453
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:48,200
laying in view even if it was a product

454
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:50,690
you liked what just did hated you yeah

455
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,510
any brand deals like all of this Ron

456
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,220
used to be so genuine and so like he

457
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:58,130
wasn't a cell and then the moment you do

458
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,360
something that you even even if it's a

459
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,350
product you like it's like you're a

460
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,029
sellout

461
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,740
it's different now though people are

462
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:05,360
more open to it yeah we didn't have any

463
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,990
ad reads today but thanks to ninja milk

464
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,120
for sponsoring this happens is are a lot

465
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,730
more open today you still kind of

466
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,620
refrain from doing a lot of brand deals

467
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,210
and you do have opportunity for the

468
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,580
podcast we do some we do it oh yeah

469
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,080
there that we're very selective with it

470
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,510
so I think this is very interesting

471
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,340
because you come from a place where like

472
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,200
you said your ad revenues really does

473
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,210
really well but brand deals I'm sure

474
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,820
that's like a huge end that it is a lot

475
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,789
with staring or tea ryan is more like

476
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:37,669
Adsense or whatever you get I mean I

477
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:39,770
should be doing more brand deals usually

478
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:41,179
I'm just it's different when like for

479
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,039
like the podcasts like this is it's a

480
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:44,330
lot easier cuz it's just you know you do

481
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,429
a read and if it's something that like

482
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,260
oh yeah I could use that or I used it

483
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:49,640
it's super easy yeah because we're just

484
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,620
talking about but if it's like oh make

485
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,600
up like a trailer like one of those like

486
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,399
fake trailers around this product or

487
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,909
something and it doesn't if it's not

488
00:18:55,399 --> 00:19:00,289
funny or like cool or interesting and

489
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:01,760
that's not a easy thing to do without a

490
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:03,409
product if you throw a product in there

491
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,700
it just kind of ruins it yeah you know I

492
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,110
think there's a difference though the

493
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,630
type of content you're building is very

494
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,309
different it's not yeah vlog II or just

495
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,110
challenge videos that you could just

496
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:14,570
throw the product into right you're

497
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,159
doing like fully scripted stuff yeah so

498
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,669
a second channel view is obvious

499
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,710
yeah like play game or like do whatever

500
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:25,850
but yeah making a whole skit around the

501
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:27,440
product is not that easy so you get a

502
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:32,630
lot of crap for that - well this is a

503
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,399
dope-ass video like fortnight yeah what

504
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:37,640
that one wasn't like fortnight came to

505
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:39,409
me I had the idea and I went to

506
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,169
fortnight and let's talk about that I

507
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:44,720
guess because there are a lot of brands

508
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:47,720
that go to you but you know you you kind

509
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,630
of don't you rarely ever like I put a

510
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,010
second thought into it at first you had

511
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,420
to reach out for brands but now brands

512
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,580
are coming out to you

513
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,110
still mix but yeah yeah for sure and how

514
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,240
did you start that off because you know

515
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,430
like being like oh check out our blog is

516
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,920
very like legitimate and everything yeah

517
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:06,020
out to the car yes so I mean my

518
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,020
background is in sales and account

519
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,870
managing so I kind of knew how to do

520
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,850
that already but it was essentially of

521
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,160
putting together like a media kit or

522
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,990
putting together like a basic deck of

523
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,260
your numbers and then just reaching out

524
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,120
and saying this is what we want to do

525
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:26,240
and this is why you should work with us

526
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,330
so you're saying you make a deck for

527
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,670
every single sponsor know that you make

528
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,350
like a generalize yeah yeah yeah then

529
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,450
you pitch with your deck you send it to

530
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,890
the company or the place you want to go

531
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,010
to see if yeah it's some kind of sponsor

532
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,210
right mm-hmm and ask them a rate yeah

533
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,890
interesting

534
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,810
so for bloggers out there who want to

535
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,890
make their own blogs I mean you they

536
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,000
should really just check all your blog

537
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,220
because that's what you guys talk about

538
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,980
right and yeah I actually built a holy

539
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:56,210
course on teaching how to do the brand

540
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:58,190
stuff I'm gonna it's uh you would have

541
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,630
to do a blog you gotta write a lot no

542
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,410
I'm not gonna do it but there's a way

543
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:05,030
that you can apply it what would I put

544
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,980
the course together for is geared

545
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,320
towards bloggers but all the skills are

546
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,700
usable for anything that you do hmm that

547
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,740
you're trying to sell yourself or like

548
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,930
for branding your brand is that yeah

549
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,990
it's on how to how to how to pitch and

550
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:19,490
negotiate yes like this is applicable to

551
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,550
like any form of social media yeah

552
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,440
Instagram YouTube twitch whatever you

553
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,820
know I think there's like some things

554
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,290
you have to tweak but for the most part

555
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,060
it's all skills that you can use

556
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:32,420
anywhere see I think that's interesting

557
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:34,520
because that if people can learn to do

558
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,320
that or like do it on their own you

559
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,270
don't have to go to these other like

560
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,670
come like these people these networks

561
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,670
that are trying to sorry I know you just

562
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:53,660
I just joined an MCN yeah yeah a lot of

563
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,310
that is stuff that people can be doing

564
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,390
on their own yeah not necessary if they

565
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,760
don't have the time but I'm saying

566
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,110
that's all they do basically a lot of

567
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,670
what you're what you guys are doing on

568
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,430
your own exactly you could easily just

569
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,710
you know join somebody to help do that

570
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,280
for you or I mean eventually if you're

571
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,900
making up

572
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,820
you can hire someone to do it for you if

573
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,100
yeah I want to do it anymore I mean we

574
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,570
we use the same thing for us in YouTube

575
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,330
we were part of an MCN but we pitched

576
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,470
ourselves a lot mm-hmm - and I think

577
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,940
that's part of the allow that though

578
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,370
don't they take a percentage regardless

579
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,110
uh it depends on your contract right I

580
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,600
think it's changed now now like the

581
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,340
contract that I did I made sure that if

582
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,410
I found my own see people didn't know

583
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,540
that before though yeah yeah like a lot

584
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,130
of people got screwed and I mean it goes

585
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,330
with the whole like the whole phase

586
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,460
thing that's happening right now right

587
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,810
like isn't that their whole situation

588
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,610
about like the contract that he signed

589
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,870
it wasn't a good contract yeah what's

590
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,850
his name T foo Sifu

591
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,230
yeah his his contract I mean they just

592
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,400
released it today what it was and it's

593
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,890
not a good contract and they even

594
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,690
admitted it but like everyone back in

595
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,640
the day was just signing this is how you

596
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,440
get successful we'll help you out but

597
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,150
you give away so much and people just

598
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,860
it's not their fault you're not lawyers

599
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,050
you know a lot of people just get

600
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,420
excited and see opportunity and they see

601
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,130
their people they're fans of they how

602
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,490
big they got and you just jump into it

603
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,620
and I would say as a warning just I

604
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,810
always tell people because they asked

605
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,550
like oh sure way sign with this this is

606
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:16,340
what they're offering me just read the

607
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,960
contract yeah and I mean I got on

608
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,370
yourself too I think that's the thing

609
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,410
like most people think contracts are

610
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:26,990
very overwhelming they are they can be

611
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,760
they can be but I think it's a lot more

612
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,380
common sense than you think to like you

613
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,050
can just read some of the basic stuff

614
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,030
that like I don't understand all the

615
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,410
legal mumbo-jumbo but there's some

616
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,660
things that are like ownership of

617
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,640
content you know like some really basic

618
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,650
stuff that should be red flags if you

619
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,250
see it or just ask what ya mean yeah

620
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,900
exactly

621
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,670
there's a lot of times I ask about stuff

622
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,250
C but what they do is and then think you

623
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:52,370
guys think about this - you're not a 18

624
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,140
year old kid yes

625
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,150
you're not like in your teens or you're

626
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,220
not even in your 20s you know and and

627
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,710
imagine if you're that young someone's

628
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,900
coming at you with this you know do you

629
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,850
can be a part of someone so made million

630
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,240
million dollars this year he works under

631
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,740
our label or under our MCN this could be

632
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,240
you you know help you get those

633
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,470
partnerships we can they pull all these

634
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,330
flashy things out there and then you

635
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,950
just start signing people sure so it

636
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,450
makes sense and sometimes they do help

637
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,250
but a lot of times I know a lot of

638
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,050
people who like they are off they get

639
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,450
screwed yeah

640
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,950
yeah it's just a numbers game yeah I

641
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,570
don't know how we got in this topic

642
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,700
again well I mean work cuz we were

643
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,410
talking about brands and how he kind of

644
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,420
initially started right yeah he was

645
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,270
finding it for himself and then you

646
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,500
talked about how MC ends you know kind

647
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,570
of kind of took advantage of it in the

648
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,580
early stages of YouTube yeah I don't

649
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,380
know how that is now I don't know yeah I

650
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,790
think people are smarter but this is

651
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,190
such it was just a interesting thing

652
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,210
because that that whole phase thing was

653
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,040
happening yeah I don't know if you know

654
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,980
more about it you're the you're the up

655
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,300
to date guy well I mean there's not much

656
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,860
more to discuss I mean they are

657
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,720
releasing the contracts there's already

658
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:59,380
been a lot of videos about it is he

659
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:02,200
still suing then uh he as of this moment

660
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,520
he still is but he asked his lawyer to

661
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,610
kind of like retract a lot of the

662
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,830
statements for yeah and then even banks

663
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,390
is like yo like you live down the street

664
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,040
from me why don't we just talk like

665
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:14,380
we're gonna just talk in person I feel

666
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,390
like in social media now a lot of people

667
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,630
feel like if they're the first to out

668
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:21,280
someone yeah the whole internet just

669
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,780
jumps on their side yeah because of the

670
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,120
whole like canceled culture and stuff

671
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,740
yeah but I mean you could easily avoid

672
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,660
these things by talking about it in

673
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,970
person but if you want the numbers if

674
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,340
you want money you come out you just say

675
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,050
any any random thing and then everyone's

676
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,300
like what what what and you just get a

677
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:40,450
hell of views well you know what you

678
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,460
don't be even crazier like super crazy

679
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:45,880
is if this whole phase thing was planned

680
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:48,610
and it's just a phase what if they just

681
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,320
planned this together like hey we don't

682
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,180
have dropped we haven't had good drama

683
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,220
lately yeah like just all PR they're

684
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:57,190
gonna pretend to sue us we're gonna make

685
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,560
a ton of money I mean I'm not us I'm not

686
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,480
accusing them of doing this but they

687
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,860
could easily do that yeah look at

688
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,900
whenever there's something big about a

689
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,180
celebrity it's like Oh guess who's

690
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,740
albums coming out next week you're like

691
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,880
in like where they just announced you

692
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,210
know like that stuff happens all the

693
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,640
time

694
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,870
so I wouldn't hire people make sense

695
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,060
that does make sense

696
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:18,520
damn we win is that why you do so much

697
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,160
random stuff why just to be like

698
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,770
relevant all the time no maybe I should

699
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,770
stop doing random stuff yeah you got a

700
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:31,230
baby shoes now we didn't actually do the

701
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:34,650
random things back

702
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:36,179
I don't like the way you said it you

703
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,190
know it sounded very negative still

704
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,630
you're just like I'll keep them quiet

705
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,490
and then what it does something still be

706
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,650
disappointed let's not do that

707
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,600
I love when we have guests that actually

708
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,400
know us they always end up roasting you

709
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,350
so people can see like what the real

710
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,669
relations like it's starting to fill it

711
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:55,559
up yeah you're let's say this for the

712
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:57,480
the audience that doesn't understand and

713
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,130
know our relationship with a lot of

714
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,140
people like some people would think like

715
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:05,010
I'm I'm a douchebag Ryan's a douchebag

716
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,990
or like is lighting yeah it's never a

717
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,820
real argument like I know that we have

718
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:16,049
real arguments well yeah but it's not

719
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:17,790
like we hate each other the other day

720

Paco wants to fighting him basically

728
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,490

729
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:44,370

00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,360
them no I'm gonna come in as dirty as

732
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,870
possible yeah then I don't want this and

733
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,610
yeah or any of it strategy exactly every

734
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:56,130
advantage you're actually for wrestling

735
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,080
did you ever like not brush your teeth

736
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:01,799
the day of a meet or like nobody I've

737
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,140
wrestled people who smelt like [ __ ] like

738
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:06,450
literal like poop and you think they

739
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,830
literally well the thing is - it's you

740
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,309
never know because wrestling is such a

741
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:13,049
like a intense sport - like in that day

742
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:15,360
it's not like even like MMA we're like

743
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:16,590
the weigh-in yeah day before right and

744
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,140
then they're just like they rehydrate

745
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:21,240
they we eat like it in the weigh-in room

746
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,679
that morning you're you're like 20

747
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,120
pounds less than you should be no waters

748
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,320
in your system you know when you have no

749
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,840
water and your dehydrator you know what

750
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,210
your breath smells like yeah it that

751
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,850
like morning breath times a hundred so

752
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,140
everyone has that in the room plus you

753
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,470
don't care how you smell because you're

754
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,540
starving and you're thirsty so I mean it

755
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,870
there's no excuse for not shower you can

756
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,820
still shower when your own

757
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,860
you still shower I don't know but

758
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,960
somebody will really smell sounds like

759
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,429
people don't wipe by their yeah

760
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,510
there's there's been some people I feel

761
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:50,980
like I don't know maybe they're trying

762
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,340
to I mean you see that as a strategy

763
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,650
kind of cuz I mean he's already hard to

764
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,270
function and breathe yeah I imagine a

765
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,159
smell there yeah you know you're trying

766
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,799
to choke him there are smell although

767
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,929
that like because they smell I would get

768
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,150
upset and it would make me wrestle even

769
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:08,799
harder it's like because normally I'm

770
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,620
very caught like even when I wrestled it

771
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,059
was like I was very calm yeah a lot like

772
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,970
people who some people would use anger

773
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:18,520
and emotion I never really got like use

774
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,649
my emotion like I'm the only times ever

775
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,080
got mad I have it on video too actually

776
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:24,730
and Shaun can attest his - cause he was

777
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,260
there it was somebody like I had like a

778
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,059
wrapped finger cuz I was injured and

779
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,830
some guy tried to grab it and as I can

780
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,510
like the fight like AB regionals or

781
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,590
something like that and you could see

782
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,320
and he was grabbing I was like shaking

783
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,870
his hand off and I just got pissed and I

784
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,610
just destroyed him because like that I

785
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:43,149
don't like you like who does that like

786
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:45,010
you haven't he really going hurt me like

787
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:48,309
you're already at him advantage so I

788
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:50,049
don't know I think the smelly thing to

789
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:51,370
some I know it's not their fault but

790
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:52,510
sometimes when you smell something

791
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,370
that's that bad it's like come on dude

792
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:58,299
yeah but you could tell the difference

793
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,950
between body odor and poop yeah but this

794
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:01,419
is was gonna say I think you don't

795
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,120
realize when you're that desperate to

796
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:06,880
lose weight some people you take

797
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,039
diuretics laxatives like maybe he

798
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,659
actually did she himself at home yeah

799
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,049
and it was just like man I just got to

800
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:15,730
get out of here I gotta win or lose I do

801
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:16,390
feel like this setup is like two against

802
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,440
one

803
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:22,330
for what it's literally us always like

804
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,570
that but even on film days it's like

805
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,460
everyone against me yeah I mean you kind

806
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,809
of set yourself up for we don't have to

807
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,490

and we're back welcome back to the

816
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:04,210
second half of off the bail podcast um

00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:10,240
just like that that's all um and so um

819
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,700
NPR NPR talks and it's something about

820
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,150
it that's really nice I think it's this

821
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:24,490
Claud this ASMR it's basically a Samar

822
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:26,710
though for like ER yes PR it is ASMR kit

823
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,260
is only talking considering as Noir -

824
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,150
yeah I think they talk like that English

825
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,590
chargers weird sound anything a trigger

826
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,390
do you think that triggers do you get

827
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,930
that thing cuz I try oh I don't get it

828
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,960
at all either

829
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:40,630
Wow no I don't get it

830
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,310
at lunch today though I wanted to I had

831
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,310
an idea to start an ASMR where I just

832
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:49,300
drink drinks I don't know if that exists

833
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:50,230
should be you literally we just so

834
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,000
happened to be talking by and you

835
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:55,150
literally had that I had that thought

836
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,860
yeah at lunch today things add up then

837
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,630
there's something about so you know I

838
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:03,550
was thinking about - I was resisting see

839
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:05,280
I recently saw Joe Rogan his podcast and

840
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:09,130
they were talking about you know

841
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:11,140
psychics and like he mean obviously real

842
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,670
there's there's a debate whether they're

843
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,440
real nuttin right some people really

844
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,530
believe in it so I'm really don't Joe

845
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,120
Rogan the stance is like they're all bs

846
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:21,550
pretty much but then they were talking

847
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,550
about and it made me wonder - you know

848
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:26,770
how when you like think about somebody

849
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,640
calling you or like not not somebody

850
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,110
calling somebody you think about

851
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,940
somebody and then they call you or

852
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,680
laughs yeah that that happens to you

853
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,850
guys right never happened to me you

854
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,210
never like thought about something

855
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:39,760
they'd text you all of a sudden know so

856
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:41,260
here's my thing ever - no that's

857
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,170
happened to me but I think what it is

858
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:46,360
though is that you just only notice

859
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:48,940
those yeah like you're always thinking

860
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,500
about like something or someone and it

861
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,760
just happened that that a lot yeah yeah

862
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,810
it's very coincidental

863
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,830
yeah and it's but there's a lot of

864
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:58,720
really like like it happens to me a lot

865
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:00,550
like very very frequent

866
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,350
and maybe it's just because and it's

867
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,610
like random people like people the only

868
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,990
time maybe the only time I notice it is

869
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,000
when I'm thinking of someone that I

870
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,770
shouldn't like you haven't talked to you

871
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,510
after today and then I don't mind my

872
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:12,910
mind is it oh I'm psychic my mind goes

873
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,230
to like the hut how did it they're

874
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,060
listening to me or like they're like

875
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,820
like yeah I guess this I get like

876
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:20,860
suspicious I'm a very I guess I guess

877
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,450
I'm paranoid everyone just has has bugs

878
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,800
in your house yeah I don't know I just

879
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,590
my first thought though I started

880
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,360
thinking conspiracy I bet you if we were

881
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,520
to take DNA test we probably have

882
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,680
Chinese in us I mean I think more sure

883
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,120
would yes as I'm okay Tommy will do

884
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,460
right yeah I think all these is just

885
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,750
like kind of a mix ya know yeah well I'm

886
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,070
gonna start claiming it when they take

887
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:44,980
over the world and then I'm just gonna

888
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:47,710
um I'm also a part you know you're just

889
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,720
sitting on the fence for now yeah for

890
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,180
now I mean I mean I just never took the

891
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,990
test but I'm sure if I did have you

892
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,720
taken the test yet

893
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:58,000
I've taken the MyHeritage one not the

894
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,600
not the what's the more popular one is

895
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,760
23 23andme my hair to join honestly was

896
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,860

899
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:14,170
your that's how they break it down 98%

900
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,580
Chinese or Vietnamese like it wasn't I

901
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,140
would think you'd get more of a

902
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,260
breakdown than that but it was like this

903
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:22,270
really broad generalization so the guy

904
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,460
like they contacted us and sent it to

905
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,720
see if we wanted to check it out I said

906
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,710
I check it out first before I write

907
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,150
about it and that was one of those

908
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,130
sounds like I'm not writing about this

909
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,630
cuz he's like how how was your how are

910
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:34,050
your results I was like well I found out

911
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,050
I was Asian

912
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:39,760
surprising yeah yeah cuz I thought it'd

913
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,700
be cool if I got like a deeper breakdown

914
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,330
yeah stuff I didn't know 23andme does

915
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:48,970
like crazy stuff like how short your

916
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:50,890
legs are or like they do weird genetic

917
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,700
things to who you're related the people

918
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:54,010
you're related to

919
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,840
I think that's interests all we have

920
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:58,870
yeah cuz somebody we met was like yeah I

921
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,390
got a profile that said like you're

922
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:06,870
unlikely to be a sprinter because of

923
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:06,870
your like genetic makeup and what I

924
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:13,100
yeah I didn't this it's even more like

925
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:15,020
and as you keep developing it's like hey

926
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,850
you're probably not successful yeah

927
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,160
you're probably living hey

928
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:21,650
you're living with your mom in her

929
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,690
basement just like you're not really

930
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,890
gonna do anything in life having

931
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,590
interesting to know would you want to

932
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:29,690
know that's the question Oh see that

933
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,310
that is a good question though cuz then

934
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,380
are you the type of person to be like

935
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:35,210
I'm gonna prove this wrong right

936
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,000
you know it's personality based at that

937
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,830
point so Oh what let's take it even

938
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,680
further what if these types of tests

939
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:45,590
could be like this is the exact day

940
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,120
you're gonna die I want you guys to know

941
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,920
I would want to know - I don't really

942
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,890
yeah you wouldn't want to know I don't

943
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,230
know man I think as a planner like I'd

944
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,850
prefer to plan like maybe it's just good

945
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,070
to know yeah especially if it's a

946
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:59,630
guarantee yeah I'm not gonna die before

947
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:03,380
then obviously unless I do something

948
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:05,210
super stupid yeah what if it's like but

949
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,280
what if it's like the matrix to where

950
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:10,700
it's like they're telling you this to

951
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,710
actually make you live longer or they're

952
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,180
taking this and because they because you

953
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,670
read it that's why it's coming true

954
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,620
yourself of self fulfilling interesting

955
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:20,030
conspiracy I wouldn't I would want it

956
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:23,360
you would want to know yeah you would

957
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:25,670
want to know - I don't know I'm on the

958
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,160
fence about that one but why cuz like

959
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:31,610
you'd be scared to know when you die

960
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,260
well if I know when I'm gonna die and so

961
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:34,520
I start like oh I know I'm gonna die I

962
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,770
should start doing a lot of things

963
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,570
before that which sounds good but is

964
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,820
that really me doing those things

965
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,930
because that's what I want to do or am i

966
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,510
doing it because I know I have an

967
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:46,130
expiration date I think that's my

968
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,240
thinking too much about it yeah nobody

969
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,890
know I know what you're so what I'm

970
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,260
saying right yeah authentically

971
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,480
genuinely you're just thinking about

972
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:57,020
this loop and you're gonna be in your

973
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,060
own head until you die you crazy over

974
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,160
thought myself to death be crazy from it

975
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,990
all have this expiration date and we

976
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:10,340
looked it up and all of ours are on the

977
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:12,020
same day like what happens on that field

978
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,720
trip yeah we just think hey we can't be

979
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,730
around each other yes that day I mean

980
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,730
yeah but it would you know happen though

981
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:21,950
that's the thing so yeah I don't think I

982
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,109
would try to avoid it

983
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,660
okay okay so you guy said yes you would

984
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:29,240
know when you wanna know yeah would you

985
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,650
want to know also how you died yes yeah

986
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,589
absolutely sure I don't know why I

987
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:36,680
thought that would be there's movies

988
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:38,960
about this right isn't there yeah yeah I

989
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:42,050
would absolutely if I couldn't have the

990
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,650
choice to know when and how yeah why not

991
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,720
think so too

992
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,579
okay haven't you ever thought about that

993
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,320
idea I mean you you're more religious

994
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:51,230
right you're like yeah from a Christian

995
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,220
background and yeah but I always had the

996
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,710
thought because I didn't really know I

997
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,510
didn't really know I never had to go to

998
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,800
church when I was a kid like I always

999
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,470
used to think about these kind of things

1000
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,470
like how it feels to die and like even

1001
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:05,839
being like what if however you die you

1002
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:07,190
just you know your brains too and I

1003
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,020
don't know I know the science behind it

1004
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,780
doesn't make sense but what if that last

1005
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,670
feeling of whatever you feel is just it

1006
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,890
just keep you keep feeling that's all

1007
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:18,770
you're over Syria yeah or rest of

1008
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,180
eternity and it's just like I don't know

1009
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,490
it's a possibility

1010
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,470
maybe that's considered like hell or

1011
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,820
like this and then if it's a good

1012
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:28,579
experience and that's your version of

1013
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,440
heaven what I don't know I just have

1014
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:32,839
right but what's like what's a good

1015
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,849
experience in your dad a good expert

1016
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:36,829
well some people say they feel euphoric

1017
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:38,180
right people who claim who have died and

1018
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:39,680
come you know right before you die you

1019
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,160
feel like there's something release I'm

1020
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,050
chemical right yeah I don't know that I

1021
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,160
don't know what it is there's some

1022
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:54,079
chemical that's released right before

1023
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:55,790
you do it like I I don't want to talk

1024
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,290
about it cuz I don't know enough yeah

1025
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,329
but it's something like something you

1026
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,950
work you feel heard that right as you're

1027
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:02,569
dying or something like that and people

1028
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,579
have said it because they've died and

1029
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:07,490
come and or revived or whatever it was

1030
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:09,050
hey you know what let's do it man social

1031
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:11,990

1033
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,800
experiment gone wrong well I mean dude

yeah oh and I didn't he but if I had to

1040
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:33,290
die in a painful way yeah I would want

1041
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:34,350
my body to be like stretched like one of

1042
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:37,560
those old

1043
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:40,980
why torture chambers you know I in the

1044
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,900
medieval days that sound so why like why

1045
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,670
I think oh man Dan I don't believe you

1046
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,100
like I don't think it would be the most

1047
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:50,430
interesting thing like who dies like

1048
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,110
that anymore you know this is just I

1049
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,710
don't believe you for one and this is

1055
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,270

00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,440
did watch Scarface

1077
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:07,200
that's good not as good as I thought it

1078
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,730
was gonna what's kind of old yeah it's

1079
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,830
just like they did that was the first

1080
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:14,370
time you've seen it yeah and I was just

1081
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:16,320
like this is so real like story to it

1082
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:18,210
you know it's just a lot of like cussing

1083
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,830
and yeah what made you want to watch

1084
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,570
that cuz because I was like oh I should

1085
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:23,460
watch classics too so I have like

1086
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,320
references that and things to look up so

1087
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,960
I'm like studying and doing I was like I

1088
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:30,810
was like so I Google that's like why his

1089
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,760
Scarface so popular and then a lot of

1090
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:35,280
reviews are saying Scarface was actually

1091
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,660
a really poor movie but the reason why

1092
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,270
did so well is it's a cult classic

1093
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,190
amongst like like there's a lot like

1094
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:44,180
that black and Latino communities

1095
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:46,609
because it was the first of its kind

1096
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,470
it was just so like different and vulgar

1097
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:50,359
that a lot of people were like I like it

1098
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:52,690
you know because it is different I was

1099
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:55,309
like okay I can see that well I mean

1100
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:57,020
that's like somebody I just saw a post

1101
00:41:55,309 --> 00:42:00,410
somebody posted like oh I'm this years

1102
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,690
old and it's a picture of me doing like

1103
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,460
the how to be ninja and how to be you

1104
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,470
know and you go and walk back and watch

1105
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,510
though you tell somebody hey I grew up

1106
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,280
watching this and like if they go to

1107
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,619
those videos I'm embarrassed like I

1108
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,119
don't want people to today like to watch

1109
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:16,010
that because if you compared to the

1110
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:16,700
content that's out today you know I mean

1111
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,410
like yeah

1112
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,150
but that's in the same way that movies

1113
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,400
back then you might have grew up on it

1114
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,750
so you might like oh even if even if

1115
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,099
they go back to watch those videos it

1116
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,319
might think it's still like oh it was a

1117
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:28,760
classic for yeah I'm you go back and

1118
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:30,559
it's the same thing you go back and

1119
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,150
watch movies because I watch movies I'm

1120
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,430
like oh this was bad but I still enjoy

1121
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,600
watching it because it's like I'm just

1122
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:39,040
like reminiscing like Harold and Kumar

1123
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,569
[Music]

1124
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,250
it's an older movie no I'm talking like

1125
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:45,619
going back to like the movies of like

1126
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:48,530
home alone yeah right I saw and you

1127
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:50,180
watch it again it's not bad it's just

1128
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,440
like you compared to like the comedies

1129
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,540
and stuff they have like the effects

1130
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,010
everything that they have now it's just

1131
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,750
like this is this would never hold up

1132
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,430
today but it's a great movie still and

1133
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:00,530
I'll still watch it yeah a lot of its

1134
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,809
nostalgia like it's just that that's

1135
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,640
what holds it together I mean like I

1136
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:05,599
grew up watching like the x-men cartoon

1137
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,680
yep

1138
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,420
yep it's a horrible series if you go

1139
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,130
back and watch any of those episodes

1140
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,599
really that bad

1141
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:20,089
the only cartoon I think that was

1142
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:24,890
actually decent was the Batman oh wow

1143
00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:26,540
that's like 90s one oh that one for

1144
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:28,880
really long remember though remember the

1145
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,290
one where he had the red he turned red

1146
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,240
and black he was like all like young and

1147
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:37,670
oh yeah super skinny dude yeah

1148
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:41,420
everybody was like may I that resurfaced

1149
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:44,720
because you know Edward from Twilight is

1150
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:47,089
playing the new Batman he's this verse

1151
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,440
even pac-man and I was like oh isn't

1152
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:51,680
that such an interesting choice that

1153
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,440
they picked robber pens him yeah yeah

1154
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,900
but I mean like you like it huh no it's

1155
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,460
not that just from what I've heard yeah

1156
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,109
and things is like his acting just got

1157
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,720
you know way better and there's clearly

1158
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:04,970
a reason why the casting directors are

1159
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,070
looking at him I think I think he's one

1160
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:09,470
of those guys who were probably decent

1161
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:12,349
actor just unfortunately it was part of

1162
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:14,300
a really bad franchise well or might not

1163
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:16,460
have even been bad it's just like

1164
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,710
because it was so popular with like a

1165
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,750
younger demographic yeah it's late it's

1166
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:22,280
early and because in our society now

1167
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,320
it's it's like hey let's hate on this

1168
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,500
cuz it's fun you know that's the thing

1169
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:32,300
to do so everybody just jump Linux yeah

1170
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:34,490
that thing about vampires I've seen him

1171
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,099
you know why you're one of those it's

1172
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:38,660
because it had so much lot like fans

1173
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:42,050
anything with a lot of guys like Justin

1174
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:44,540
Bieber his any anyone older than him is

1175
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:47,510
like he's well yeah and like I was there

1176
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:49,040
like I liked his songs like a lot of his

1177
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:51,770
songs I thought were like this is super

1178
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,210
catchy he's held talented I would make

1179
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:54,530
Joe and I wouldn't make jokes about him

1180
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:56,480
because I was the culture at the time

1181
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:57,980
yeah but like it's just cuz he was

1182
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,080
popular if he wasn't that popular if

1183
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,390
like he had a he was like indie right

1184
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,520
going back to like when people not that

1185
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:06,230
saying that you just you do that but if

1186
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,250
he was just independent a few people

1187
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:09,050
knew about and back then there's this

1188
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,390
good-looking kid he'd get sign I mean

1189
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:13,310
he'd be like popular anyway mm-hmm if he

1190
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,900
was like single I mean who's the current

1191
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:20,990
person right now who's like the most

1192
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:24,109
popular teen he's weaned on heart I mean

1193
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:26,060
like ariana grande kind of a lot of

1194
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:27,950
people like lover wait a bit lot of

1195
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,930
people like to hate on their kids oh do

1196
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:34,520
you think yeah Swift - well she kind of

1197
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:35,869
she has a lot of PR issues okay that's

1198
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,190
not a good example but like you know

1199
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,750
like you know I'm talking about the last

1200
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:40,339
Justin Bieber's of the world

1201
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,170
One Direction it's like they can

1202
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:43,940
actually be talented people but because

1203
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,920
their audience is so crazy and in love

1204
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,320
with them and young it's looked everyone

1205
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,170
else's like that's so lame yeah what's

1206
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:53,540
that new girl

1207
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:56,360
Billy Billy I wish ya different though

1208
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,950
but she's not mean she's not made she is

1209
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,570
mainstream but she's mainstream now in a

1210
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:02,900
different she in a different way

1211
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:05,000
yeah that's true like if her fans start

1212
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,100
becoming like I think right now she's in

1213
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,690
that she's becoming that yeah but if her

1214
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,250
fans start becoming like those hardcore

1215
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,020
like oh my god

1216
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,640
defend her at all costs kind of thing

1217
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,470
you know in the way that BTS fans you

1218
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,300
know like their yeah BTS is getting tons

1219
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:19,700
of heat from people who aren't BTS fans

1220
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,930
because of their fans yeah and it's just

1221
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,700
like when you're at the top of that list

1222
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,990
you know and you're the hottest thing

1223
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,820
and all these young people who are

1224
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,320
rooting for you and defending you like

1225
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:30,170
more than they should be

1226
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,580
it it naturally you're gonna have the

1227
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,440
opposite effect when you have that much

1228
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,150
love you need that much heat I wonder if

1229
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,130
it happened with like way back in the

1230
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,730
day before sexual I'm like I'm like the

1231
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:40,010
Beatles

1232
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:42,080
I'm sure there's Beatles here so there

1233
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,910
was yeah and it's at the time and I'm

1234
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,410
sure like you know now we're like you

1235
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:49,850
can say something bad about the Beatles

1236
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:51,860
yeah in 50 years or 50 in the 50 years

1237
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:53,780
right we're just gonna be people were

1238
00:46:51,860 --> 00:47:02,390
like oh my god how dare you say that

1239
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:05,330
about Justin Bieber he's a class he

1240
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:07,880
brought our countries together he's the

1241
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:09,170
reason why there's peace remember and in

1242
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,060
the history books they talked about when

1243
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:14,080
he peed in the bucket like you guys

1244
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:16,730
remember the classic bucket gate yeah

1245
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,790
alright when he was like driving drunk

1246
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:22,370
yeah and it's really fast yeah same with

1247
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:23,750
Jake Paul Logan Paul yeah all gonna be

1248
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:25,370
part of the history books because of how

1249
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,840
big they were and they're not gonna be

1250
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:36,200
well they might be remembered in

1251
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:37,790
different ways but their careers aren't

1252
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,010
over you know like they still have the

1253
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:42,790
hard question if they can still turn it

1254
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:45,470
around for what their legacy is gonna be

1255
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:48,710
do I feel like even just Logan already

1256
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:50,720
has for how deep into a hole he was and

1257
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:53,300
to where he is now it's night and day

1258
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,040
like he was canceled according to most

1259
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:57,260
people but he really wasn't you know

1260
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,250
yeah he's still relevant despite what

1261
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,900
people will say because they're

1262
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,060
comparing to his the top of his game and

1263
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,960
ksi said that he would be friends with

1264
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,589
Logan

1265
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,200
I'm Jake interested hmm and Jake didn't

1266
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:10,460
even do anything that crazy I know we

1267
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,400
didn't even talk about this after that

1268
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,750
podcast you did you see that we I mean

1269
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,650
you know that we work yeah I did a

1270
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,240
podcast with him

1271
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:18,619
he said that he would actually be

1272
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,060
because we asked could you ever be

1273
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:22,310
friends with Logan he was like I think I

1274
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,930
could but I could never be friends with

1275
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:26,960
Jake thinking that's such a strong

1276
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:28,900
statement like so definitive yeah and I

1277
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,070
and he said he's just a bad person

1278
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,650
Wow I was just trying to figure out I

1279
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:35,720
was like what like cuz that's how you

1280
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:38,270
would talk about Logan so like what yeah

1281
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:42,109
what josy like things can change so are

1282
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:43,490
you saying just before that we're

1283
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:45,950
talking about Jay Paul and how like

1284
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,330
Justin Bieber before that yeah right and

1285
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:49,220
then Billy Eilish

1286
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:50,570
yeah Oh what I was saying about her

1287
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,310
right because she's still kind of like

1288
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:54,020
she's weird right yeah she's kind of

1289
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,910
like Lord when Lord just came out yeah

1290
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,460
I'm a weirdo like but like good music

1291
00:48:55,910 --> 00:49:00,109
and just just different like very unique

1292
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,570
and it's a kind of cool yeah it's kind

1293
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:03,770
of indie but mainstream indie that makes

1294
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,790
sense oh yeah yeah I don't know how to

1295
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:07,580
describe that kind of music

1296
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:10,160
what's like it's it's like anti pop

1297
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:12,140
right yeah so because it's anti pop a

1298
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,390
lot of play and I and I just think that

1299
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:16,940
it's because she's still new it's why

1300
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,020
she's not getting that kind of hate well

1301
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,690
and you know what it all it takes is one

1302
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:22,280
scandal one thing she says wrong and

1303
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:23,690
then she's gonna build a resume she's

1304
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,310
young do that's what I mean

1305
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,920
young people always say something we're

1306
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:29,210
all like I've seen her interview where

1307
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,310
she's like watching herself from a year

1308
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:32,869
ago and like you could take that into

1309
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:35,240
like all she's so relatable she's so

1310
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:36,830
like you know a normal person but like

1311
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,609
you could take that even that interview

1312
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:40,460
in another way too

1313
00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:42,230
yeah so especially if you're on media

1314
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,730
all over the place yeah it's running a

1315
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,530
marathon

1316
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:47,690
yeah and then even if you are perfect

1317
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,310
it's like she's trying so hard to be

1318
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,440
perfect like you know there's always

1319
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:52,790
gonna the bigger you become still think

1320
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,380
it's always a balance the more love you

1321
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,750
get the more hate you're gonna get yeah

1322
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,890
and everything and I think we can go

1323
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,710
into that and talk about it especially

1324
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:02,000
with YouTube because both of you guys

1325
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:04,250
when when you were doing social media

1326
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,390
uh-huh you had kind of like a clean-cut

1327
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:11,240
you know family friendly type of brand

1328
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:12,500
yep Ryan definitely family friendly a

1329
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,870
lot of times when he swears on the

1330
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:20,570
podcast people like oh my gosh he's

1331
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:24,110
war or something and she but uh so what

1332
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:25,700
what is the pressure like you know where

1333
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:26,840
you have to keep it like this but you

1334
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,970
know your personalities aren't

1335
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,100
necessarily it wasn't hard I'll tell you

1336
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:34,040
me really mean it wasn't hard for me

1337
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:36,500
either yeah it doesn't make it it

1338
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,910
doesn't make it funny like it wasn't the

1339
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,790
jokes I was writing weren't based on

1340
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:42,260
what being vulgar like so it's not hard

1341
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:45,200
I mean sure sometimes you'd be like to

1342
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:46,940
say even any an unnecessary f-word is it

1343
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,080
it's like a fart joke it's super easy to

1344
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,410
make something funnier if you're being

1345
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,230
vulgar

1346
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,670
it's like shocking I mean I still like

1347
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:57,170
fart jokes though Thanks

1348
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:59,120
abs are swearing I mean I agree I think

1349
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:00,650
well we weren't doing like daily

1350
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:04,460
vlogging or anything like that either we

1351
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:06,170
were very we picked what we curated we

1352
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,260
curated all our content so it was easy

1353
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:12,140
to put together what we look like from

1354
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,850
the outside appearance but I mean for us

1355
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,550
it was just the thought of like well a

1356
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:20,240
we came out like people knew we were

1357
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:22,310
Christian and I think there's there's a

1358
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,370
stigma with it that's good and bad and

1359
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:27,860
we didn't I mean we're pretty I would

1360
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:29,540
say we're very laxed about like how our

1361
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:32,060
views are it's not like we don't curse

1362
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:34,760
or any of that or drink you know like we

1363
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:37,370
drink we curse whatever but it's just

1364
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,680
the appearance of we just want to be

1365
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:41,360
responsible with our platform because

1366
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,250
people can take that one thing and just

1367
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,470
twist it like we were talking about

1368
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,970
earlier so we just kind of chose to say

1369
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:49,430
okay well we want to come out make sure

1370
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:52,310
we have a clean appearance also for

1371
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:55,190
brands premieres a lot of business so

1372
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:56,870
for me our first like when I first

1373
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,480
started on YouTube it was actually more

1374
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:02,240
like my content I said the F word I said

1375
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,730
a bunch of stuff like I said [ __ ] I said

1376
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,160
like a bunch of like thank you yeah and

1377
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,410
one and also I just didn't think much of

1378
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,660
it right and then I started getting like

1379
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:13,240
emails and stuff from like parens and I

1380
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:17,000
was still a kid too I mean technically

1381
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:19,940
yeah and that's when I realized like oh

1382
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,070
like there's actually kids most of my

1383
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,420
fanbase is like not just thirteen to

1384
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:25,580
seventeen because that's what you two

1385
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:27,080
would show but you're like like

1386
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,740
five-year-olds I would meet and like

1387
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,660
eight-year-olds I would meet are

1388
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:32,460
I'm eating him though they would just I

1389
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,840
would just see him mocha and then they

1390
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,750
would be like oh I'm a fan of like him

1391
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,460
you heard me say [ __ ]

1392
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:40,290
so warrants actually emailed you and

1393
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,020
said could you add some that some of

1394
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:44,580
that and then I saw it for myself in

1395
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,110
person when people started coming up to

1396
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:48,240
me yeah I was like yeah I need to chill

1397
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:50,580
out on that not for brands at the time

1398
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:54,930
cuz I wasn't making any money but it was

1399
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:57,330
like oh I should probably not say every

1400
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:58,710
good stuff but it wasn't like Mila it

1401
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:00,480
wasn't that hard like it wasn't like

1402
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:05,369
that wasn't my thing anyway that's not

1403
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:07,080
what I wanted to portray I guess yeah I

1404
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:09,720
so don't I mean even if I'm swearing on

1405
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:12,150
this it's not like you know I don't

1406
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,850
think it's not in a context where it's

1407
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:17,010
like I'm trying to I'm trying to force

1408
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:18,810
it I don't know I don't have an issue

1409
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,920
people that swear to be honest yeah and

1410
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:22,170
it's not like you're swearing every

1411
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,360
other word yeah it's when it's

1412
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,710
appropriate and the thing is to like

1413
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,330
people who do talk like that

1414
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,650
if that's just how they speak maybe

1415
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,600
that's how they the way they grew up

1416
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:33,060
like I don't have an issue like it's

1417
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,550
just words I think we give words too

1418
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:37,350
much meaning to me personally

1419
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:40,290
but I also don't get offended easily so

1420
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:42,869
yeah that's true but a lot of people in

1421
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:44,970
the world do and that's why we kept

1422
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:48,090
their channels that way yeah yeah pretty

1423
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:50,100
much yes good question Paco you almost

1424
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:51,030
done with good questions don't give me

1425
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,490
another good question

1426
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:55,080
all right why is your hair like that

1427
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:57,420
what's wrong with my hair right now

1428
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:00,150
no you just always have had like with

1429
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,650
like bait the very stirs that what agent

1430
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:04,109
haircut where it's like why are you

1431
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:05,550
shaved on the side this is a second like

1432
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:06,810
ever since the cab podcast you're just

1433
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:09,090
trying to find ways to roast

1434
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:12,780
no I'm man you picked on his hair too he

1435
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:15,930
did heavens hair was he just came out of

1436
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:20,670
Sunday school I'm so gonna send him this

1437
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:31,710
thing I cut my own hair oh that's why

1438
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:34,200
that makes sense that normal because I

1439
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:36,600
honestly because we moved so much is

1440
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,640
hard to find a haircut person that I

1441
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,070
trusted he's like hair is a very

1442
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,550
particular thing and I also my hair grow

1443
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,190
so fast

1444
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:47,070
I didn't want to pay for haircut every

1445
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:50,820
week you're making $50 a month this time

1446
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:52,260
yeah and now this 25 now I'm like I've

1447
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,760
just gotten so used to it it's easier

1448
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,830
for me to cut my hair than until I go

1449
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,360
out and get a haircut mmm true I know

1450
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,770
it's not a perfect I say if I know how

1451
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,870
learning to cut my own hair I would

1452
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:02,340
probably do that yeah it took me a long

1453
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:04,740
time like it used to take make an hour

1454
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:06,510
to cut my own hair so but your reasoning

1455
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,770
is different you would only want to

1456
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:10,320
learn how to cut your own hair so you

1457
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:11,820
don't have to leave your house yes but

1458
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,560
that's what like it's for convenience

1459
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,600
like I just like and I just like

1460
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:19,380
learning the new skill like to be able

1461
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:22,290
to I don't like that no but you know so

1462
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,790
I probably save so much money and people

1463
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,740
don't you two would know because I'll

1464
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:28,260
cut it really short and I'll wait until

1465
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:30,600
it's super long that's true right

1466
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,850
I am I am trying to teach kids you know

1467
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,280
how to be smart with your money

1468
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:37,320
yeah haircuts aren't cheap they aren't

1469
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,780
cheap especially good ones yes so if you

1470
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,030
if you just don't mind looking fugly for

1471
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:44,160
like a good three weeks to a month you

1472
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:47,190
could save a whole you could cut your

1473
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,930
hair hair cut expenses in half just let

1474
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:52,980
it grow out how often do you cut your

1475
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:54,750
hair like once a month okay I know that

1476
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:58,620
mine but I go like once I'm suin s have

1477
00:55:54,750 --> 00:56:00,240
a maybe yeah yeah you should we should

1478
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,250
introduce wait is it that lady that I

1479
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,300
think I might have gone to her once I'm

1480
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:07,110
using the same person

1481
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:09,240
yep yeah okay no I liked her I just okay

1482
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:13,050
you just didn't want pity no I think I

1483
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,430
tried it right before we left and then

1484
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,300
at that point is when I started to learn

1485
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:19,830
how to cut my own hair

1486
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:21,780
no so yeah I cut it this way cause it's

1487
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:24,720
the easiest way to cut it I can't I've

1488
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:26,160
tried to like fade it more too hard and

1489
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,210
the back of my head mmm so it's the

1490
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,530
easiest way to come here

1491
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:32,760
well for those that are just listening

1492
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:35,760
he just has a very Asian stereo

1493
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,320
you know so even Andrea our hairdresser

1494
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,330
tried to give me that same hairstyle

1495
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,770
where just shade on the sides and like

1496
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:43,170
long on the top and kind of goes to the

1497
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:46,470
side and I don't know why every

1498
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:47,700
hairdresser just really liked that for a

1499
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,230
short amount of time and then every

1500
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,900
asian guy for whatever reason that not

1501
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:54,289
just Asians get people to go but there's

1502
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:58,410
a lot of what a lot of Asians have had

1503
00:56:54,289 --> 00:57:00,119
and I I just I don't know I didn't want

1504
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:03,539

a lot of crap member can you watching :

1532
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,770
yeah yeah it's from culture

1533
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,880
appropriation that kind of isn't it

1534
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:13,380
interesting how that was like the hot

1535
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,349
topic and then all of a sudden it's like

1536
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,970
kind of died like people still talk

1537
00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:19,500
about it but it's not like in every like

1538
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:21,539
oh someone so appropriated this this

1539
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,460
isn't like that was like a all these it

1540
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,890
PC PC news of the week we haven't done

1541
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:28,349
that in Y in a while PC is of the week

1542
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:29,490
just real quick culture appropriations

1543
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:32,609
not in right now

1544
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:34,770
no you can still do it and get called

1545
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:36,450
out for it but news articles and stuff

1546
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:37,799
they don't really care about that as

1547
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:40,500
much what is the current thing people

1548
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:43,859
care about it I would say the most

1549
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:45,450
recent one is not immigration it

1550
00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:47,339
supports the most abortion abortion

1551
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:49,529
that's the current one yeah yeah

1552
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:51,150
that's the most current one now you talk

1553
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:54,359
give your opinion about anything having

1554
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:58,170
to do with pro-life or parole abortion

1555
00:58:54,359 --> 00:59:00,390
or trying yeah yeah that is the it is

1556
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:01,049
not a current just at the yeah at the

1557
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:02,220
right time

1558
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:04,740
this is if you want to have some

1559
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:07,650
conversations with people post about it

1560
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:09,480
and you will upset

1561
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:12,060
laughs the world probably both sides I

1562
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:15,090
think honestly the new cycle completely

1563
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:18,990
changed with this presidency before it

1564
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:20,430
was a bivy like more celebrities and

1565
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:22,740
like that's what was interesting but

1566
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:25,230
because of Trump right right

1567
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:28,950
every new cycle is always something that

1568
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:31,140
he causes well if he because he's in the

1569
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:33,000
news yeah well yeah but like yeah his

1570
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,440
stuff is so controversial that that's

1571
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,730
always the hot topic in the news it's

1572
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,620
something that he's involved in but

1573
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,810
isn't it funny that when it's in it goes

1574
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:41,490
and it literally is like people could

1575
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:43,410
still be appropriate in cultures but

1576
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:45,360
they weren't right about it because it's

1577
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:47,070
not gonna get them views exact all that

1578
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,470
matters like I know people are genuinely

1579
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:51,390
offended by it but like people really

1580
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:53,220
care about their views that's what it

1581
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:55,050
really comes down to oh absolutely yeah

1582
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:58,560
it's whatever remember when people who

1583
00:59:55,050 --> 01:00:00,210
are mad about ALS or like super into

1584
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,410
supporting eilat like you'd like the ice

1585
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,610
bucket I spent there was so much

1586
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:03,150
controversy oh you're just doing this

1587
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:06,030
for the views

1588
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:07,800
I mean who who's still who's still

1589
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:09,780
looking that stuff up who still cares

1590
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,760
about ALS I mean other than the people

1591
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,930
who really did care about it right talk

1592
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,970
about it who stopped was talking about

1593
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:16,080
it other than right now yeah if we

1594
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:18,870
didn't bring it up I think people would

1595
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:20,220
not care Oh No there might even be some

1596
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:24,210
people who done don't even know what

1597
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:26,190
that is I'm talking about all those

1598
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:28,980
people that was like a couple years ago

1599
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:30,930
more than that right feels like more

1600
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,460
