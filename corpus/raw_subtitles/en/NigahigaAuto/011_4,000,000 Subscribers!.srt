1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,950
ever since we came over - my life's

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,200
never been the same

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:11,250
who's they used to bring me happiness

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,929
joy now just seemed meaningless dump

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,020
I wrote a poll the pain that lies

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,240
beneath the sphincter of my dreams show

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:23,730
them not art they'll tell thigh of thee

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:27,119
or else the nothing feels right what to

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,470
do say it wasn't you alright yes it is

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,150
true I am now the number two most

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,560
subscribed person on YouTube for some

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,610
reason a lot of you guys are more upset

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,809
about it than I am

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,489
don't get me wrong being number one on

15
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,980
YouTube was such a great honor but how

16
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:43,079
can it be sad when I just hit 4 million

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:46,530
subscribers wait what play the happy

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,200
music yeah yeah that's the flashback

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,520
music great anyway so I know I've been

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,840
mixing in apples for a little bit and

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,420
the reason for that is because I've been

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,809
sick in fact I've been sick for a while

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,180
now yeah you thought I was gonna do the

24
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,760
same joke for the fourth time no it's

25
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,330
been a while guys I grew up I'm mature

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,470
I'm an adult moving on the real reason

27
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,090
why I've been gone for such a long time

28
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,220
is because I just got done filming for

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,080
my first TV show appearance that's right

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,760
I'm gonna be on a TV show called super

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,439
ninjas on Nickelodeon I'm not sure how

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,159
much I can say so if this video does get

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,930
removed you guys know why right drugs

34
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,009
they take everything away and I already

35
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,259
know what you guys are gonna say in the

36
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,360
comments all Ryan you are such a sell

37
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,970
out you do the mainstream media thumbs

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,590
up if you agree and if the 302 view is

39
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,030
you I was actually supposed to play the

40
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,350
lead on a TV show but the reason why I

41
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,210
turned it down is because they wanted me

42
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,590
to remove my youtube videos so before

43
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,640
