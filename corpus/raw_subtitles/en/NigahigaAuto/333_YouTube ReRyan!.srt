00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,530
YouTube rewind what yeah actually

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,329
YouTube rewind is just showing all the

23
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,829
biggest videos and trends of the year we

24
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,239
can do that yeah but with a really high

25
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,860
production value and a bunch of

26
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,550
youtubers making cameos how are we

27
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,559
supposed to do that

28
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,870
we can't but you know what we can do a

29
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,109
really crappy version of it with no

30
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:03,359
cameos from other youtubers just me and

31
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:05,939
we'll call it YouTube rear ioan ah boom

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,110
I love it I love it I love it didn't you

33
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,820
just say that you weren't going to make

34
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,680
videos that take a long time stop living

35
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,510
in the past Derek that was 15 seconds

36
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,010
ago alright let's talk about the past

37
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,750
now if we're gonna do this we have to

38
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,490
think about all the biggest trends that

39
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,409
happen this year ending with the biggest

40
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,549
so if we work backwards what was the

41
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,820
biggest trend that happened this year I

42
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,750
would say Adele Adele yeah she was one

43
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,330
of the biggest things this year

44
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,479
I don't recall I think he means a Dell

45
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,400
computer right what no no Derek tell

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,829
computers were not a big thing this year

47
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,520
I know I'm time Adele the singer her

48
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,170
album her song hello hi oh her yeah I

49
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,880
mean I guess she's up-and-coming but I

50
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,140
wouldn't end the whole video with what

51
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,640
are you talking about she broke records

52
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,009
this year over million sales in a week

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,720
27 million views in a day did YouTube

54
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,820
rewind do something about her no exactly

55
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,140
fine what ideas you guys have been what

56
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,670
about the pizza rap video that was

57
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,930
relevant for like a week with a girl

58
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,060
throwing the shovel that was even this

59
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,280
year hitting the Quan know I still think

60
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,329
Adele's bigger iPhone 5 that was like

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,079
two years ago

62
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,750
I mean 5s okay I got you hotline bling

63
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,399
by Drake okay that's actually a decent

64
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,200
way I told you Adele wasn't the biggest

65
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,760
thing no I still think Adele's album was

66
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,319
just as big look even if they were equal

67
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,940
who's gonna pick that del over Drake

68
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,560
well it's either del or Drake and

69
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,629
there's two options there's three of us

70
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,069
yeah so let's take a vote fine

71
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:26,550
I vote for Drake fine I vote it down

72
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:28,620
what about planking what planking it was

73
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,360
huge everybody did it well he does have

74
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,890
a point now was five years ago

75
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,120
well now we have three options so we

76
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,440
can't vote what are you talking about

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,730
that's not even an option let's just

78
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,840
forget the ending for now that just go

79
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,069
back to the beginning what are we

80
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,540
