00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,939
hey guys so my birthday just passed a

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,799
couple weeks ago and to me that's

3
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,569
usually a sign and a reminder that a

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,490
bunch of kids just graduated whether

5
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,929
it's college or high school and it's

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,920
only a matter of time before we start

7
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,139
seeing a bunch of those you know

8
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,000
graduation speeches go viral all of like

9
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,440
some celebrity or some successful

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,730
business person seeing something really

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,109
inspirational to the crowd mate to be

12
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,910
able to inspire a bunch of people with

13
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,930
just your words especially live in front

14
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,519
of thousands of people and then

15
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,170
eventually millions within that video

16
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,060
goes viral that's that's the dream some

17
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,150
people just have a natural gift with the

18
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,550
words unlike people me I have not much

19
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,260
skill and it's not like I haven't been

20
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,610
given the opportunity to do it my old

21
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,410
high school asked me to speak a bunch of

22
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,550
times at their graduation or some reason

23
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,110
other high schools that I even go to

24
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,370
wanted me to speak at there's even some

25
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,079
colleges which is pretty ironic

26
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,250
considering I'm a college dropout and

27
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,570
I've turned them all down it's not

28
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,280
because I didn't want to do it or

29
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,809
because I hate public speaking I can

30
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,520
force myself to speak in public I turn

31
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,289
them down because I honestly believe

32
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,789
that if I were to give a speech at a

33
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,250
graduation ceremony

34
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,170
I would probably ruin it or so I've been

35
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,489
told by people that I've showed my rough

36
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,260
speeches to most of you guys already

37
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,600
know but I am pretty realistic and

38
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,040
honest and that's not the best qualities

39
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,479
to sound inspiration like you know those

40
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,470
sports movies like read at the end of

41
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,720
the movie where they have their biggest

42
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,189
toughest opponent and then the coach or

43
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,750
like a player stands up and gives some

44
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,610
inspirational speech to just get

45
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,200
everybody pumped up and fired up and

46
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,909
just ready to go and beat this team yeah

47
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,040
I could do that too but at least I'll be

48
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,810
honest about it I personally think that

49
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,100
being realistic and honest is more

50
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,100
inspiring so you're not being lied to

51
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:29,220
look I could tell you guys that we're

52
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,380
gonna be the best team stepping on that

53
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,780
Court tonight I could tell you guys that

54
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,729
we worked way too hard to be going down

55
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,380
like this I could tell you guys that it

56
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,220
doesn't matter that they're bigger

57
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,799
faster stronger more athletic that even

58
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,170
though the entire city the entire state

59
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,000
has already counted us out that we don't

60
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,390
need to believe it because if we play

61
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,030
with heart if we play as a team if we

62
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,080
play like we want it more than they do

63
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,400
there is no way we can fail

64
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,740
you know what it's like to be the ones

65
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,140
who are passed on we know what it's like

66
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,330
to be the ones to start at the bottom of

67
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:14,930
the pit and work our asses off to get

68
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:17,150
back to the top no one who's never been

69
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:21,710
on the bottom can keep up with people

70
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:24,260
who have and overcame it tell you all

71
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:28,130
that cuz we all know it's not accurate

72
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,260
what I can tell you the truth we will be

73
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,560
the second best team on that court

74
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,790
tonight we will play as a team but so

75
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,250
will they and they've been playing

76
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,620
together longer than us yes of course we

77
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,360
will want it but probably just as much

78
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,370
as they do because they want to win too

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,550
right because one thing something does

80
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,470
not war getting Johnson yes no when you

81
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,880
ask that girl to prom that night did you

82
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,150
want her to come with you

83
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,970
yeah and did she exactly

84
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,740
Callahan yes coach you're the shortest

85
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,650
guy on the team maybe the entire school

86
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,800
did you want to be four - mmm and yet

87
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:09,170
you still are aren't you mr. Ghoulies

88
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:11,330
jolly yes coach when I picked you up

89
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,910
with a game tonight did you want me to

90
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,769
run over you can't wait what I said when

91
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,050
I picked you up for the game tonight did

92
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,550
you want me to run over your cat and

93
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,950
throw it's half dead body in the bushes

94
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,780
by your house I do answer the question

95
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,910
mr. Cooley shall they go of course not

96
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,620
exactly see the lesson here is you can

97
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,630
want something more than anyone else in

98
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,830
the world and you still don't get it

99
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,370
because the world does not revolve

100
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:36,320
around all of you do you understand me

101
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:41,230
what was that yeah so what we gonna do

102
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,230
tonight how bad are we

103
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,980
we went to the state finals that year we

104
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,390
didn't play but we cheered really good

105
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,500
well but back to the whole graduation

106
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,450
speech thing when I would get these

107
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,710
graduation speech inquiries I would

108
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,390
start writing down a bunch of ideas in

109
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,970
my phone like how I would plan for a

110
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,590
video not planned very well I was just

111
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,780
trying to be completely honest and just

112
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,130
be me and it turns out that me being me

113
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,290
trying to give advice to a bunch of

114
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,870
graduates is not only not inspirational

115
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,340
but borderline inappropriate according

116
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,690
to some people not that they would know

117
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,730
anything they haven't given high school

118
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,690
graduation speeches I still think those

119
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,430
speeches are decent and not

120
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,200
inappropriate at all in fact I still

121
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,340
have the drafts on my phone so I can

122
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,840
read you guys some of the lines that I

123
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,740
had in these speeches that I was told to

124
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,180
take out because they're inappropriate

125
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,530
you guys will see if people are just too

126
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,850
sensitive these days I mean like

127
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,520
seriously it's a high school graduation

128
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,110
they're not teenagers and all jokes

129
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,580
aside these are actual lines that I

130
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,260
wrote for these speeches that I was told

131
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,520
to take out and I still don't see why

132
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,200
there you go gotta get into the whole

133
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,090
graduation speech voice burning

134
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,760
suppression or inspiration Robins 20

do whatever it is you want to do in life

138
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,770
if you want to be a drug dealer go be a

139
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,300
drug dealer

140
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,010
people need college as much as they need

141
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,810
hair conditioner you can do it you don't

142
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,280
need it you already shampoo there are

143
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,720
gonna be times that you become so

144
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,800
overwhelmed by everything that you might

145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,030
even get to the point where you're

146
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,710
thinking about killing yourself nobody

147
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,270
likes to study unless you're some kind

148
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,980
of freak it doesn't matter if you never

149
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,210
reach your goals or accomplish any of

150
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,010
your dreams you are going to fail

151
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,690
whether it's a test or a job interview

152
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,190
or even a relationship you will fail

153
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,930
life is like playing a video game

154
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,910
life is like a sane and DragonBall life

155
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,370
is like a box of chocolate some of us

156
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,980
have nuts and some of us go yeah I can

157
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,630
understand why I was recommended take

158
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,160
out some of that stuff not everyone is

159
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,690
gonna get the Dragon Ball or video game

160
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,770
references let alone the Forrest Gump

161
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,240
thing I don't see what's wrong with the

162
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,280
rest of it if I'm hearing it back now I

163
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,630
can see how out of context it sounds a

164
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,100
little inappropriate but it really isn't

165
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,360
in reality it's not something that high

166
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,350
schoolers haven't already heard they

167
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,910
have the internet I just feel like

168
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,530
people these days are so quick to get

169
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,820
upset over every little thing and if

170
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,260
they were to just take the time to

171
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,910
really listen to what's being said they

172
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,380
might find that they're getting mad and

173
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,850
raising an uproar over pretty much

174
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,080
nothing something that is not even being

175
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,580
said something that's being created in

176
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,960
their own head and for the exact reason

177
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,130
that's why I would never give a high

178
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,630
school graduation speech even though

179
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,190
it's one of my life goals and one of my

180
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,930
dream I'm not willing to censor myself

181
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,100
some of us have nuts and some don't

182
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,330
what's wrong with that I mean when I was

183
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,980
writing those speeches I was just

184
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,020
thinking what I would say to my high

sorry let me just good afternoon class

212
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:13,230
of 2008 mieze now I know because I was

213
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,720
all of you ten years ago that you don't

214
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,880
like long speeches because of the whole

215
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,830
ADHD things so I will keep this short

216
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,040
and straight to the new iPhone yep

217
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,350
before not even know you hey come on

218
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,730
bunch of freaking idiots or swear oh you

219
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,380
really think we're gonna get that fat oh

220
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,940
look I'm just gonna get straight to the

221
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,740
point and start this off by asking the

222
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,600
simplest question you can ask a person

223
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,430
what is the meaning of life so many

224
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,990
people young and old have a tough time

225
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,280
answering that question but wouldn't you

226
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,900
think that should be the first thing

227
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,280
that we figure out the purpose of our

228
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,810
lives the reason why we're doing

229
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,370
everything that we're doing there's no

230
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,230
right or wrong everyone can have their

231
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,970
own answer but to me the meaning of life

232
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,590
is happiness I really believe that

233
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,150
everything that we do throughout our

234
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,580
lives is because we think it will either

235
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,840
make us happier or less unhappy than if

236
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,070
we didn't do it even things that we

237
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,390
don't want to do like studying for a

238
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,640
test all night you're not gonna gain

239
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,370
happiness from studying nobody likes to

240
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,690
study unless you're some kind of freak

241
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,340
you do it because you think it will

242
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,930
eventually lead you to happiness just

243
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,100
like everything else that we do studying

244
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,660
will help you pass a test and you'll be

245
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,760
a lot happier if you pass a test and if

246
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,380
you fail passing the test will lead to

247
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,790
better grades better grades leads to

248
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,590
better colleges better colleges

249
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:20,070
increases your chances of securing a

250
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:24,360
better job and oh sorry my phone locked

251
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,800
quick just 6-9 6-9 6-9 better colleges

252
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,540
increases your chance at securing a

253
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,940
better job that makes more money so you

254
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,380
get a nicer car or a nicer house or eat

255
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,700
it fancier restaurants whatever it is

256
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,720
you want to do later in life everyone

257
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,160
does what they do because they think

258
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,990
it's gonna make their overall lives

259
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,310
better than if they didn't do it and the

260
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,200
reason why I bring this up and why I

261
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,270
think it's so important to understand

262
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,280
the meaning of life is because life is

263
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,630
gonna become more and more hectic when

264
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,950
you go off on your own there's gonna be

265
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,270
so many more things that you have to

266
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,410
think about that you never had to think

267
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,330
about as a kid and there's gonna be

268
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,650
times that you get so overwhelmed by

269
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,670
everything that you might even get to

270
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,980
the point where you want to kill

271
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,170
yourselves I know I have because life is

272
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,100
like a box of chocolates it can be sweet

273
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,050
it can be

274
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,550
it can get a little nutty and you no

275
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,530
longer have your parents around anymore

276
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,730
to eat those disgusting raspberry ones

277
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,990
for you you got to deal with those on

278
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,430
your own now when also life is like a

279
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,870
box of chocolates because the more you

280
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,690
get into it the fatter you get as well

281
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,280
so these low points in your life are

282
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,840
going to happen to you if you want to

283
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,670
grow as a person maybe not to the point

284
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,110
of considering suicide but just know

285
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,670
that if it does get to that point that

286
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,870
it's not happening for no reason and

287
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,370
there can still be a benefit from it

288
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,750
because if you survive and figure your

289
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,100
way out of that situation and that

290
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,900
mindset you'll have the mental strength

291
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,760
to be able to deal with anything in the

292
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,810
future and you can't acquire that kind

293
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,030
of strength without going through

294
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,740
extreme adversity it's like a Saiyan and

295
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,600
Dragon Ball the more you beat up a sin

296
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,270
without killing him stronger he gets

297
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,430
when he recovers yep I understand that

298
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,960
is the first point I understood so far I

299
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,910
watched a bunch of those inspirational

300
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,710
speeches because I had no idea what

301
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,150
possible advice I could have for a bunch

302
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,860
of graduates and I want to get an idea

303
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,300
what those other speakers were talking

304
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,530
about and a common theme that kept

305
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,780
coming up that they were all giving

306
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,580
advice on how to strive for greatness or

307
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,960
how to reach your goals or how to become

308
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,220
successful like they are and it's

309
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,540
inspiring because they're telling you

310
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,190
how they were just like you when they

311
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,560
were younger and they weren't anybody

312
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,720
special and they failed over and over

313
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,280
and over before they found any success I

314
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,140
agree with that message like I mentioned

315
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,970
earlier you are gonna have low points

316
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,040
failure is a part of life whether it's a

317
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,570
job interview or becoming a parent or

318
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,310
starting a family whatever it is you're

319
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,870
going to fail I completely agree with

320
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,550
that a lot of these speeches were very

321
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,290
inspiring and they are helpful to help

322
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,210
you reach what our society defines as

323
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,680
success but before we figure out how to

324
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,210
reach success in life shouldn't we at

325
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,160
least try to figure out what success in

326
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,900
life is we spend so much time thinking

327
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,460
about all these goals and dreams that

328
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,630
we've had since we were little kids and

329
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,490
how we're gonna reach them that we

330
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,840
sometimes get so distracted that we

331
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,490
forget why we're trying to strive for

332
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,930
them in the first place you can set and

333
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,460
go after all the goals you want in life

334
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,410
but it all leads back to the same thing

335
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,850
the meaning of life happiness that

336
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,260
should be your primary number one going

337
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,820
everything else should come after and I

338
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,440
know that sounds super obvious and

339
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,670
cliche and easier said than done at

340
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,110
times but I personally think it's very

341
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,250
important to have that in the back of

342
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,470
your mind and keep reminding yourself

343
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,210
that way when you start to stray from it

344
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,490
you'll recognize it you'd be surprised

345
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,650
how many people including myself focus

346
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,510
so much on how to reach our individual

347
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,490
goals or what our society defines as

348
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,570
success that we don't even realize that

349
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,160
we're not even happy anymore

350
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,260
most of the time that unhappiness is

351
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,320
caused by ourselves it's fixable but we

352
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,210
don't even recognize it

353
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,460
so caught up chasing after these goals

354
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,230
and stress ourselves out so much to the

355
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,640
point that we're miserable but yet we

356
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,350
just suck it up and we just keep going

357
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,880
because we think that once we finally

358
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,320
reach these goal is that all this stress

359
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,510
and unhappiness is gonna go away and

360
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,130
we're just gonna live a happy jolly gay

361
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,840
life well I can tell you from personal

362
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,400
experience that's not how it works if

363
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,170
you're not happy with your life on the

364
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,000
journey to your end goal you're most

365
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,380
likely not gonna be happy even after you

366
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,970
reach it it's like playing a video game

367
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,320
you don't play a video game that you

368
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,060
hate just because you think it's gonna

369
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,470
be fun once you finally beat it it's

370
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,820
almost the exact opposite of that the

371
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,680
best part of the game is a journey the

372
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,150
moment you beat it the fun is over but

373
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,100
it's exactly that it's a moment of

374
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,510
happiness and that feeling will fade as

375
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,860
soon as the end credits come rolling by

376
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,870
then you're bored and it's time for a

377
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,730
new game my point is don't let society's

378
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,290
definition of success dictate your goals

379
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,870
and dreams and contrary to most

380
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,400
inspirational speeches I personally

381
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,320
think that it doesn't matter if you

382
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,270
never reach any one of your goals or

383
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,100
accomplish any one of your dreams if

384
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,660
you're enjoying the journey don't waste

385
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,980
your time playing a game that makes you

386
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,930
miserable just because you saw the

387
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,550
glorified trailers or because you heard

388
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,900
all the hype around it we're not having

389
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,250
fun playing it it's not gonna get any

390
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,420
more fun just because you beat it

391
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,920
there's a lot of other games out there

392
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,140
and the night is still young you guys

393
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,510
have the time find the game that's meant

394
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,460
for you and have fun playing that's the

395
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,170
whole purpose of playing the game that's

396
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,080
the whole purpose of this journey that's

397
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:32,110

398
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,390
