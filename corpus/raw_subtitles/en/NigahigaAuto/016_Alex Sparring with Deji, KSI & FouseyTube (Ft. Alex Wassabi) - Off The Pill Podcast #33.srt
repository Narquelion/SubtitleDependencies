you're almost daily right yeah I was

55
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,980
doing daily you slow down yeah that was

56
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,080
just crazy

57
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,920
it was crazy yeah it was not worth it

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,459
like the numbers are way up but how long

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,160
did you keep that up for I think like

60
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:43,430
every day like yeah like six times a

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,959
week cuz I've missed days yeah okay well

62
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,160
what else is new we were just talking

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,790
about I don't know how us to bring it up

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,690
but you just had a little boxing match

65
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,130
I'm weird just talking about that so

66
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,170
it's weird because I want to read bring

67
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,410
that up though so you just had a boxing

68
00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:00,620
match with I didn't know this with Busey

69
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,120
yeah it was far more as a sport I don't

70
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,890
know that's no they just told me right

71
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,959
before you got here yeah and I was like

72
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,459
oh I didn't even know that happened why

73
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,860
don't you tell me and apparently he did

74
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,980
but I I don't recall Ryan likes to

75
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,170
ignore me when I yeah but I mean so you

76
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,440
you boxed him where did that come from

77
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,989
so first like I used to like play around

78
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,459
and like train a little bit nothing

79
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,920
serious and then so I knew a little bit

80
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,540
about boxing and he said he wanted to

81
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,820
spar me on his live stream a long time

82
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,640
ago like a couple months ago I was like

83
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,590
all right so he's part of in his live

84
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,470
stream and I like just messing with him

85
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,760
a lot and he was doing horrible and so

86
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,290
then he trained a couple weeks and he's

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,079
like hey I've been training let's spar

88
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,950
again and I'm like okay let's far but

89
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:48,410
like you know sparring is like 70% you

90
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:52,430
go like 70% or 60 but when we both got

91
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:54,170
in there we just started swinging I

92
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,609
think I turned it up at the beginning

93
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,200
cuz I was like trying to keep him away

94
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:58,970
cuz I knew he was bigger and heavier and

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,590
he had the power heads he's big yeah

96
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,410
he's a big dude how much heavier is he

97
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:08,150
uh he likes to say he's 10 pounds

98
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:10,400
heavier but he's like 15 at least that's

99
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,350
unfair right I mean I mean if they're

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,340
just sparring yeah but you weren't

101
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:18,889
sporting we were that's like yeah were

102
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,959
you guys was there any like was it

103
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,950
called

104
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,780
trash-talker yeah I mean were you guys

105
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,550
like fighting like on friendly terms or

106
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,750
like oh yeah I mean was there some kind

107
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,980
of beef there no

108
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,190
there's no beef we were just fighting

109
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,350
for fun and then we both just kept

110
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,790
turning it up and then he started

111
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,620
swinging as hard as he could and he got

112
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,170
me because I didn't have any defense or

113
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,820
anything cuz I knew how to like throw a

114
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,680
punch but I didn't know how to dodge

115
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,660
dodge I didn't know how to like put

116
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,850
power in it I just knew like the basics

117
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,220
so you have like a any lasting effect

118
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,350
from that no big black did you black out

119
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,940
I didn't black out because like when you

120
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,200
get punched if you get knocked out yeah

121
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,640
you don't you don't feel it yeah it's

122
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:01,580
like wake up on the ground you're like

123
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:03,410
ah I must have lost I never got punched

124
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,970
that hard I was a little I was like

125
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,650
actually like a little foggy for like a

126
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,210
couple hours after but yeah other than

127
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,310
that there's nothing did you at any

128
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,240
point during the fight feel a little bit

129
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,710
of anger no but if I would have made it

130
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,150
past that big punch I would have been

131
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:24,980
like oh he's going 100% it's game time

132
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:26,480
but I didn't do you think Suzy was you

133
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:31,850
in that first round you were you're

134
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:33,290
punching him a lot and then the second

135
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,660
round he went to his corner and the

136
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,370
coaches were like hey okay he's keeping

137
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,380
you away just break through take the

138
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:50,180
punches and just get in there and just

139
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:53,419
get them and he did what did your corner

140
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,700
say my corner was just like he Dortch

141
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,020
doing like he can't do anything we

142
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,710
didn't expect him to come out like that

143
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:03,110
I was not prepared but now I mean I've

144
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,240
watched the footage I think I'm prepared

145
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,590
you learned from it yeah I think I'm

146
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,930
pretty good now because you said okay so

147
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,840
you guys box yeah and then you are you

148
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,560
sparred and then he trained after that

149
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,630
for sparring

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,240
yeah then this happened yeah now okay so

151
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,750
it's analogy yeah now I I'm down this

152
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,700
farm again

153
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,100
oh yeah I mean do you have more fear

154
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,830
since that has happened no I have more

155
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,510
awareness like I've watched the footage

156
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:32,000
a bunch of times I'm never gonna be like

157
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:33,620
this again and that's it like but I

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,450
think watching the footage once you see

159
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,580
what you did wrong just fixing himself I

160
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,229
mean that's a silly thing like he's so

161
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,200
much bigger than he is and it also

162
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,180
brings me to question

163
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,280
because you were talking hella trash

164
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,700
back in the day to guess I and I know

165
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:51,000
him he's huge he's way because I don't

166
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,670
know but he's huge gigantic man I don't

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,340
like 6:1 you're crazy like do you want

168
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,840
to get hurt like I could I think I could

169
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,190
put up a good match but he is heavier

170
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,180
like we know the thing is you could

171
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,910
probably tag him

172
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,720
yeah but I think I think if he tags you

173
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,790
once it's gonna hurt a lot yes arm

174
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,370
wrestle him basically two people two of

175
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,780
us arm wrestle him and we at the same

176
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,970
time yeah at the same time we couldn't

177
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,170
barely the same so freaking strong it's

178
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,570
crazy what do you mean at the same time

179
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,580
like we had well I had one arm and Derek

180
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,990
had the other arm and we just tried to

181
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,820

like yeah it wouldn't worry he'll and

220
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,960

you're shorter and lighter yeah whatever

224
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:19,680

232
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:38,370
dangerous you know that's what you do

233
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,930
yeah I thought it was funny because um

234
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,520
during that time when all that was

235
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,540
happening like we talked I was like

236
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,830

241
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,680
then I look like a if I wait I'm a bad

242
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,330

244
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,910
really good boxer I don't know he's

245
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,790

246
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:12,960

248
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,060
pull-up and he couldn't get off the

249
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,060
ground

250
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:41,790

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,670
two bullets do you have a prior fighting

253
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,980

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:57,270
what did you do sports in high school no

255
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:58,410

you're really good at basketball - yeah

257
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,960
that's it

258
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,330
I was lighting the boxing's I feel like

259
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,030
I'm potential yeah cuz I'll do like jab

260
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,460
steps and like the fakes and stuff see

261
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,440
like you know who would be a good match

262
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,830
actually I'm not for boxing basket boys

263
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,540
if he played keV good he's good he's

264
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,910
good and you guys are like same height

265
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,860

266
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,090
little skinnier right now but I don't

267
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,200
know I think that would be a good

268
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,820
matchup let's do it

269
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,620
and if he if he starts beating you you

270
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,860
just punch him and it turns into a

271
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,650
boxing match you know do that yeah but

272
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,660
um so I'm curious because you did a

273
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:36,870
little bit of boxing or at least

274
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,240
experimenting with in and stuff do you

275
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,160
like how much more respect in that

276
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,410
aspect do you have for like fighters

277
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,240
does that grow also when you're walking

278
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:49,140
around and you see people threatening

279
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,060
you oh well it's more yeah I've got a

280
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,300
lot of respect for fighters wait what do

281
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,590
you mean by three who's threatening who

282
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,780
just people step up or try to Punk Oh

283
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:02,340
cuz there's been a time where actually

284
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:04,580
have it we bring up this story here so

285
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,950
essentially so I used to work for Alex

286
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:11,310
and there's one VidCon where we were

287
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:15,780
walking back to our room yeah and in the

288
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:18,180
lobby near the elevators this one like

289
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:22,230
like black kid was like swinging this

290
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:24,270
girl around by her hair what yeah like

291
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,830
yeah she grabbed her by the hair and it

292
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,260
was like dragging her around and like

293
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,640
swing her around and I didn't notice

294
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,300
this at first we had another person with

295
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,940
us Kyle he's like hey stop that look and

296
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,100
I was like oh I was like cut that and

297
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,800
before I could finish cut that out Alex

298
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:45,750
it's printed over there pick that kid up

299
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,550
by the neck with one hand like up

300
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:52,710
against the wall and I was like how are

301
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,900
you that strong and then I got kicked

302
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,050
out of the hotel we're protecting a girl

303
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,090
well I think I've got a little gressive

304
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,650
yeah but he was literally swinging her

305
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,280
around that's a great that sounds a

306
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,470
little aggressive

307
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,270
I asked why later I went back to the

308
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,760
corrals why was he doing that as she

309
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,950
said because she threw water on his face

310
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,120
from her water bottle and he overreacted

311
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,880
well she probably shouldn't have done

312
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,530
that either

313
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,320
not the appropriate response yeah why

314
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,520
did she do that I don't know it was just

315
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,240
like 3:00 in the morning they were tired

316
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,970
mm-hmm

317
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:37,420
I guess picked up a person with one hand

318
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:39,130
maybe yes I don't know so poppy you

319
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:45,040
mentioned that you worked with Alex yeah

320
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:46,570

326
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,560
thing I was like surprised and like oh

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,090
you actually know what he's doing he's

328
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,970
unpredictable yeah what he's about to do

329
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:06,010
pretty quick you might have answered

330
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,990
this a few times already quite a few

331
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:10,540
times but I don't really know the

332
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,340
history of you and Roy but I just

333
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,470
briefly know that you guys work together

334
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,740
you started something and then you you

335
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,450
broke apart he first started he made a

336
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,800
youtube channel and he had all his

337
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,030
friends come on and there's like there's

338
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,770
a bunch of us there's like eight of us I

339
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,560
think and we're just all friends or just

340
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,630
making silly videos and then the other

341
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,970
guys in the group decided to go talk to

342
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,620
girls or start doing sports and me and

343
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,020
Roy were like the normal things just

344
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,060
make more videos like Sonia Roy stayed

345
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,860
in it and then we did it for a few years

346
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,310
and then it took off and then we moved

347
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,590
here we just film in and doing stuff but

348
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,270
then as we got older we like both wanted

349
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,220
to do different things than what we were

350
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,620
doing but he wanted to go into gaming

351
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,300
and then eventually Interlake what he

352
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,490
does now and then I wanted to get more

353
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,990
lifestyle and more vloggy so we just

354
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,180
split up and then he's doing his own

355
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,760
thing and they're both doing good yeah

356
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,260
we still hang out do you feel like at

357
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,220
the point of separation though do you

358
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,440
feel like there's a lot of tension

359
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,420
between you guys and to the point where

360
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,270
you guys split apart yet to have that

361
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,920
space and then that space created that

362
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,020
that absence created fondness and that's

363
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,150
kind of like how I actually think we're

364
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,370
better friends now then we were back

365
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:21,280

the RonRon or whatever and stuff and

394
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:42,940
then recently you started to do videos

395
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:46,780
with her sister Oh what Vanessa

396
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:48,040
me yes I said yeah I saw you wrote

397
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,120
something on Twitter I don't know where

398
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,950
it was but you're like my fake

399
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,600
girlfriend yeah like that so what is

400
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,790
that about everybody was shipping us

401
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,920
together all the time and were like so

402
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,870
let's just play into it instead of like

403
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,200
being like no no let's just so your

404
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:04,750
brother is being shipped with Veronica

405
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,699
and you're bitching so like whoever if

406
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,339
this were to happen whoever were to get

407
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:11,050
married first is like incestual cuz like

408
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,850
you know I'm saying I always wonder what

409
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:19,110
that like if you were a your brothers

410
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:22,390
are to marry each other that's incest

411
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:24,280
like that's your step as true of your

412
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,069
step something but like you see like

413
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,329
sometimes twins will marry other sway no

414
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,250
but like whoever gets married first

415
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:35,470
you're like marrying your family but

416
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:38,230
like exact same

417
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,789

the exotic know how those are

474
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,150
good-looking usually they're it always

475
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,680
ends up like an interesting combo like

476
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,080
they have like Asian eyes but they look

477
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,440
white it's very like different I think

478
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,790
there's something when I first maybe I

479
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,580
didn't know you were part Asian to be

480
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,110
honest oh yeah some people in in like

481
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,760
elementary school people I guess I

482
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,170
didn't settle into my Asian this yet and

483
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,660
they just thought I was a white dude

484
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,070
again your bad Filipino have felt you

485
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:32,380
don't have your mom is just ripping away

486
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:34,970
I've seen you post oh I had no idea

487
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,260
there were so many Filipinos and you

488
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:40,000
guys you and Roy grew up in North

489
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,000
Carolina yeah we did yeah there's a lot

490
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,140
communities everywhere yeah it's just

491
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,510
nice like there is like so there was a

492
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,310
lot of us but like when we got together

493
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,900
there's alone and then in my class I was

494
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,520
like the only Asian in every class yeah

495
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,170
it's like magnet suit because there may

496
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,180
not be a lot but they somehow find

497
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,760
themselves coming together type of thing

498
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:01,730
I heard I don't know if this is true or

499
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,500
not but in Charlotte that there's a lot

500
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,950
of racism towards Asians there is that

501
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,810
true um I don't know it's like well have

502
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,970
you experienced racism growing up not

503
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:15,200
actually because I would ask Roy because

504
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:17,720
you hope yeah yeah we uh the school I

505
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,010
went to was like 80% african-american

506
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,470
temporarily or maybe like 70% African

507
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:28,850
20% Caucasian and then 10% miscellaneous

508
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:30,080
like you know god Roy do you think that

509
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,350
contributed to why you guys stay on

510
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,260
YouTube I don't know maybe possibly

511
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,820

512
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:43,700

[Music]

553
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,339
[Laughter]

554
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,339
[Music]

555
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:47,139
on the spot I can just go back to other

556
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:49,239
things and I mean let's go back to your

557
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:52,029
content because a lot of your content

558
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:54,279
you know it is lifestyle and a lot of

559
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:56,679
times it will be about girls or you'll

560
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,210
have a lot of like girls in your videos

561
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,460
and you're aware that you know it can

562
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:03,129
bring views mm-hmm and what is your

563
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,830
thought process when constructing video

564
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:07,149
ideas you know because uh you're talking

565
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,259
about you know trying to come up with

566
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:09,519
like better ideas and that's always

567
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:12,300
thing you're trying to top yourself in a

568
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,010
way so I guess well it's just like

569
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,230
just whatever go is going on in my life

570
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:18,840
you'll see it on the vlog so I don't

571
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:21,990
have much going on or if I'm like not

572
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,720
motivated you can tell it's bad but when

573
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,610
I am motivated I'll make videos and

574
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,940
they're better and like this or like

575
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:34,050
that but a lot of people think I make

576
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,330
videos because about love and about

577
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,650
girls about cute stuff because my fans

578
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,820
like that and they do like that but

579
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,440
that's not the reason I'm making it it's

580
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,160
because I really am always looking for

581
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:47,430
love I'm always on the search for the

582
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:50,130
ones like hey there you are

583
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:51,840
done that I'd be happy then ever every

584
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,030
videos about her yeah I mean it would be

585
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,680
yeah my life with a revolver on whenever

586
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,000
I find the one my life is gonna revolve

587
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,860
around her you're a romantic

588
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,490
yeah so you're really into uh I'm

589
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:05,100
guessing you like romance films like not

590
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:07,230
straight romance movies cause you watch

591
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:12,300
the old book i watch like we're gonna

592
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:15,930
take comedy rom-com yeah action romance

593
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,100
never just romance you see why there's

594
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,670
nothing wrong with that you ever watch

595
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,500
The Notebook

596
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:31,800
okay I do ask the notebook for a walk to

597
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:33,450
remember a lot of people will say like

598
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,620
love will find you like when you're not

599
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,620
searching you know when you're waiting

600
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,920
but I also think it's difficult for you

601
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:48,090
because liger you're like you're a very

602
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:50,400
attractive guy objectively and oh but

603
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,140
anyways you're um you're an objectively

604
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,910
like very attractive person you know and

605
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,490
you're very charismatic so I'm sure a

606
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,690
lot of girls are very infatuated with

607
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,610
you they're interested they want to get

608
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,100
to know you more so you have to like go

609
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:10,080
through and like weed them out tough

610
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:12,540
problem man you're almost like la la

611
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,300
girl's frustrating because I've heard

612
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,490
that was that they always want something

613
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,000
more early want something else or like

614
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,590
they want

615
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,420
oh why don't you tell ventually they're

616
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,890
always like why don't you tag me in that

617
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,360
story oh you should post this picture of

618
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,300
I don't like girls don't tell me what to

619
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,790
post so the ulterior motives yeah like

620
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,530
they know like they enjoy like I'm sure

621
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,660
they and we have fun together but then

622
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:36,410
they're also like keeping an eye on like

623
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:43,680
I could get numbers yeah I'm this too so

624
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:45,480
make me Bert there you go how many

625
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,940
girlfriends serious girlfriends have you

626
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,040
had okay I'm sure you've dated a lot but

627
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,610
let me think okay serious serious I

628
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,480
would count so over a year there's one

629
00:26:52,610 --> 00:27:12,720
high school doesn't count that she

630
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:14,840
doesn't calendar okay so there's Vanessa

631
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,670
Shanna Daniela

632
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:24,090
on glass they don't know they don't

633
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:27,650
watch me Loren's the the youtuber we

634
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,650
yeah yeah at the most recent

635
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:36,180
she's a hispanic youtuber no I didn't

636
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,280
I've never heard of her either but we we

637
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,230
met up and then it was awesome how long

638
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,120
was that too much issue unless there's a

639
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,830
quick quick one with Lauren for a little

640
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,040
bit three years is that your longest

641
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,570
yeah as a long time your shortest is two

642
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,200
months I think so

643
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,670
probably but that two months was magical

644
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,800
mm-hmm would you say everything has been

645
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,880
magical though for you because you're

646
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,550
such a hopeless romantic you might

647
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,530
romanticize that you age I do I every

648
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:03,240
time I'm in a relationship they're

649
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:06,170
always like man it's like a movie and

650
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,030
I'm like I know

651
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:14,070
I'll run outside just cuz it's raining

652
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:15,510
and she'll chase me I'll do it like I'll

653
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,520
show up I'll be like what would they do

654
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,920
it over the cheesy dream guy that girls

655
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,750
love yeah yeah what would you say is the

656
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,570
biggest lesson you learned about

657
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:28,560
yourself and about what you like from

658
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:30,240
your past relationships oh that's a deep

659
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,970
one what's the biggest thing I learned

660
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,440
about myself

661
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:36,970
is I I realized that I go for the

662
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,830
perfect girl but there's no perfect girl

663
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,570
like everybody's gonna have problems or

664
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,890
everybody's gonna be different so you

665
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,390
have to adapt you can't just find

666
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,070
somebody perfect for you you gotta find

667
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,750
somebody and then you guys gotta adapt

668
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,309
together and become the perfect person

669
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,650
so that's what was the second part of

670
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,970
the question weight in terms of what you

671
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,409
like in a girl what you I guess what you

672
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,299
don't like you know because the more you

673
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:57,580
date the more girlfriend's you have the

674
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:59,590
more you kind of refine what what you

675
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,770
want yourself and then what you want in

676
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,900
the other person yes well people they're

677
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:10,299
always like why are you always dating

678
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:11,890
youtubers oh wait the last three like

679
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:13,690
the last two were youtubers and then

680
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:16,030
like girls I dated they're uh they're

681
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,440
often youtubers gotcha because they're

682
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,000
just like I just vibe with them because

683
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,890
they're like funny and like they're

684
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,850
witty and they're quick and it's like

685
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:26,260
they're ready for camera all the time

686
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,909
yeah yeah they don't understand your

687
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,190
struggles like oh like uploading times

688
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:31,210
yeah doing well the algorithm and like

689
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,150
I'm on my phone tweeting or Instagram

690
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,500
they know I'm working yeah even though

691
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,669
like somebody's not a youtuber doing

692
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,770
that it's not working does it cross your

693
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:39,880
mind that like you know I'm sure it does

694
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,429
to a certain degree where it's like man

695
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,780
we can help each other too in our work I

696
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,179
mean like being together being in a

697
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:49,000
relationship oftentimes it helps your

698
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:51,429
career as well on YouTube right yeah or

699
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,650
does it take it does it take away it's

700
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:55,360
just difficult to because then like it

701
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:58,570
blurs the line whether it's for YouTube

702
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,919

752
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:56,820
yes no I mean we're saying they call you

753
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,430
you got jack'd recently what's your

754
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,580
what's your training regimen is it just

755
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:04,770
boxing well I mean I tried a box but

756
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,020
it's more lifting so like I've been

757
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,060
lifting which everybody tells me if you

758
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,030
spar again it's gonna make you a lot

759
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,800
slower it's more slower could it make

760
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,750
you like you could be a little bit

761
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,790
slower but not that one's slower from

762
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,650
lifting cuz I'm just too skinny I need

763
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:21,150
to get some size you're actually not

764
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,130
that skinny though I mean like I was

765
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,930
saying you got a lot bigger but maybe

766
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,940
that is maybe that is making you slower

767
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:28,950
mm-hmm I don't know phousi was I mean

768
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:35,790

769
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:38,100
should have seen that guy have you ever

770
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:40,920
been in a fight outside of this this

771
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,960

772
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,160

774
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,130

775
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,660

00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:52,150
will be like style

777
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,950
hey when was this in your household my

778
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,560
brother like started like something like

779
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,420
it gets stopped or like any fight I get

780
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,460
stopped even at a club like I've had

781
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,930
people kicked out before but good but

782
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,060
it's cuz like they're trying to come in

783
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:06,610
to my table or something and then the

784
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,860
bouncer will grab them so right it never

785
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:11,290
escalated past that but I don't I don't

786
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,520
want it to escalate past that I don't

787
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,560

789
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,230

790
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:23,260
well I punched a girl in the stomach

791
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:26,790
once as a kid but that's it I was in

792
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:29,710
kindergarten she cut the line okay

793
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:32,710

794
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:36,250

795
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:38,200
Wow I didn't know it was a sexual thing

796
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,080

00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,610
very good job mate yeah and no and like

798
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,960
you have to run ahead of the line hold

799
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:45,190
the door and then when the last rows out

800
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,950
you got to go to the next door hold the

801
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,800
door so I got there and this one girl

802
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,990

803
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,640

905
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,240

906
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,000

1072
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,400
don't know I just I think I wanted to

1073
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,110
spar and then I I think just the way

1074
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,730
they go about talking about things or

1075
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:00,980
like doing things and just makes me mad

1076
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:04,100
cuz like makes you mad it makes me mad

1077
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,810
cuz like they're just like they they're

1078
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,760
not classy about anything they're more

1079
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:10,280
like I would stomp you in the crowd or

1080
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,400
like you're whatever and then I'm just

1081
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,320
like oh I just want to spar guys so then

1082
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,790
it got into it and then Deji started

1083
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,650
commenting on the breakup with me and

1084
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,190
Lauren and then Lauren got mad it got

1085
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,990
personal

1086
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:23,480
yeah I saw Lauren get mad and that

1087
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:26,060
triggered me to get mad and I was trying

1088
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,310
not to but once you see your girl or

1089
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:30,470
like the love of your life at the time

1090
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:32,780
get mad that you're so you have to jump

1091
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:35,090
in so it was real anger and hate then I

1092
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:37,010
don't know it's gotta be cuz I mean you

1093
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,180
seem like I did I thought it was you

1094
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,220
guys were just doing a thing like you

1095
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,450
know I really didn't know we asked kiss

1096
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:44,300
that same thing with his whole thing

1097
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:48,050
with Mugen and he actually said we asked

1098
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:49,370
him could you ever be friends with Logan

1099
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,930
no he said he could be friends with

1100
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,310
Logan he thinks in the future how it

1101
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:55,010
would never be friends with Jake he

1102
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:56,630
genuinely hates him what yeah strange

1103
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,710
but I was wondering the same thing with

1104
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,990
you do you think you and

1105
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,119
yes I could ever be homies yeah I think

1106
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,950
I think if we all if we ever saw each

1107
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:05,540
other in person like me cuz I'd edgy

1108
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:08,900
whoever like everybody's fine with each

1109
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:14,000
other just online it's just there's like

1110
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:15,530
oh hey you don't like no I don't I don't

1111
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:26,920
hate anybody

1112
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:30,020
I probably dislike nobody I don't know I

1113
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:32,270
don't hate anybody like nobody it's all

1114
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,830
in person I would be like I don't want

1115
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,330
to see you or I don't want to be in the

1116
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,330
same room or are there people in your

1117
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:40,460
past that you know on your come up that

1118
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:43,250
kind of like talk down to you or Roy and

1119
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,839
you're like I'm gonna show them and I

1120
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,670
guess when you got to that point did you

1121
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:48,230
feel like oh yeah like I'm better than

1122
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,640
them or you kind of just like you let it

1123
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:52,119
go cuz you're like I'm too busy with the

1124
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:55,400
kind of thing yeah I mean I never got

1125
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,800
inspired by haters so like I did have

1126
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,060
friends in high school that were like

1127
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,710
like all the guys that were in wasabi

1128
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:03,710
that left to go talk to girls in sports

1129
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:05,570
they super regretted it they all they

1130
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:08,540
probably all have asked me to if I could

1131
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,740
hire them to do something like after

1132
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,119
college they're like can I be your

1133
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,710
assistant can I do this I don't like oh

1134
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,330
man I can't then I had to move you out

1135
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,099
here then at the Patriot shelter where

1136
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:18,800
you gonna live who's gonna your shelter

1137
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:20,930
like oh yeah I don't have money so then

1138
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,920
I'm like I can't I have to focus on this

1139
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:30,500
so I don't know I I don't think I ever

1140
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:37,369
was like ah in your face yeah so are you

1141
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:39,080
gonna box ksi I would take cuz is dead

1142
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:41,720
GE I don't think he's fighting is he I

1143
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,900
don't see me to do my research but I

1144
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:47,240
don't know either from what I saw

1145
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:49,580
Logan's boxing ksi and the under cards

1146
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,530
all real boxers yeah like real fights

1147
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:54,260
not that you guys are in real fights but

1148
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:56,359
like actual professional boxers which is

1149
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,619
interesting and I kind of like that what

1150
00:47:56,359 --> 00:47:59,390
their explanation is like they want to

1151
00:47:57,619 --> 00:48:00,830
expose you know real boxing to a

1152
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:03,830
different audience yeah I think that's

1153
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:05,480
cool but like I don't know where I don't

1154
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,650
know anything else about like where

1155
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,480
everyone else is fighting I don't even

1156
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:10,510
know when you and phousi fought like I

1157
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,340
don't know about that that was like note

1158
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,800
involved for me at all was just having

1159
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:19,360
fun and let's go see what happens

1160
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:21,700
but I would box Deji cuz he's not

1161
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,400
training for anything I think I could

1162
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:27,070
take him like I don't think did you ever

1163
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,570
call did you call him out yet no I don't

1164
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,390
know that's someone you wanna fight I

1165
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,770
would yeah oh it's borrowed edgy well I

1166
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:34,780
don't know if I would do it in an event

1167
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:39,910
it'd just be for fun anyone else you

1168
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:41,980
want to spar um Ryan but he said no if I

1169
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:43,870
if I like took some classes and stuff

1170
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,940
and you like taught me I would I'll do

1171
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,620
it I'm not like to like knock each other

1172
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,550
out but like it was just for fun yeah

1173
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,920
yeah I'll do it

1174
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:53,320
yeah just for fun to be calling him out

1175
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,740
right now I mean I have to learn you

1176
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,990
gotta teach me how to do it first

1177
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,280
you had an all-time low actually spot

1178
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:02,440
right now as if it was like giving me

1179
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:09,640
cuz then I you can use boxing and then I

1180
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:13,810
can use but it'd be interesting I mean

1181
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:15,490
are you guys like I guess he's bigger

1182
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:16,870
than me I think a little bit taller and

1183
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:19,210
that's the only reason I'm heavier we

1184
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:21,460
weight-wise know he's also more muscular

1185
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,690
there's how much more power I haven't

1186
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,730
been working well I just started working

1187
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:28,060
on again so I'm probably gonna lose

1188
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:30,100
weight 175 early 176 now yeah I've never

1189
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:32,710
been in the seventies now what's your

1190
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,960
height five eight oh yeah we're like

1191
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:37,450
pretty close to the 510 I'm six foot are

1192
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,280
you really yeah that's the only reason

1193
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,870
I'm heavier is cuz that's four inches no

1194
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,810
it's because you have like a lot of

1195
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:46,780
muscles and stuff oh yeah well with that

1196
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:48,370
