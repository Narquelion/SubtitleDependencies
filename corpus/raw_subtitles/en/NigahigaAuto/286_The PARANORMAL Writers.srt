1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,549
alright guys as you know we just

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,160
released paranoid 74 and well the

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,080
reviews aren't that good Wow I know

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,150
right there saying it's exactly the same

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,340
as paranormal activity three two and one

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,839
that is just silly so what we need to do

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,310
is create the next sequel that is

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,570
completely different from all the other

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,640
ones any ideas

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:26,220
cut what do you got alright what if we

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,660
do everything we did in panel activity

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,070
for but at the very end when they least

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,489
expect it

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,930
hang on will activity six because

15
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,190
they're gonna be expecting five that's

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,570
what no that's exactly how we came up

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,460
with the first three sequels we need

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,710
something different I've got a

19
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,350
paraplegic activity we start off of a

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,210
shot of a guy in the dark we soon notice

21
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,100
that he's not moving like a normal guy

22
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,699
he's moving even though apparently jig

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,289
means yeah it's like a robot right no

24
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,830
it's when you're paralyzing you can't

25
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:09,560
walk oh but what if we put the robot in

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,560
the wheelchair doing that dog do

27
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,860
pare-pare that's normal activity a pair

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,009
yeah like the fruit pair yeah that's

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,009
scary

30
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,610
[Applause]

31
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,299

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,100
you're not even trying anymore yeah at

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,600
least my robot idea had a person in it

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,100
yeah that's not even relatable you're

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,070
gonna choose a fruit at least pick a

36
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,729
scary fruit like a squash yeah or like a

37
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,640
cabbage yeah yeah fine

38
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:50,429

40
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:56,039
