2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,009
Facebook snapchat all my other social

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,540
medias you probably already know this

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:11,610
but the movie that I filmed a year ago

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,469
is finally coming out I'm gay also it's

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,780
coming out as in like you can watch it

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,130
online but anyway and just for those of

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,570
you that don't already know if you do

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,100
choose to watch it it's not gonna be

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,600
like one of my videos the one this movie

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,400
is not a comedy it's a thriller slash

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,630
horror and I only acted in it I didn't

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,730
write it or direct it or anything

14
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,680
because if I did I probably would ruin

15
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,670
this actually that thought alone kind of

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,660
got me thinking a lot of you guys are

17
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,160
always telling me that I should actually

18
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,200
direct real movies like mainstream

19
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,950
movies I'm telling you right now that is

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,239
a terrible idea

21
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,559
I would ruin your favorite movies and

22
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,059
not just because I will turn everything

23
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,320
into a joke but mainstream movies are

24
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,300
nothing like making these videos you

25
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,520
have crazy expensive budgets with huge

26
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,559
sets tons really good acting is just an

27
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,270
all-around huge gigantic professional

28
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,510
production crew what do I have I have

29
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,510
this

30
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:16,900
see we're even better just why I think

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,640
some of the most expensive movies ever

32
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,660
made and recreated them to show you guys

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,610
what they would look like on a low

34
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,890
budget and more importantly what they

35
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:32,019
would look like if I directed them

happened if you gave us these expensive

62
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,909
movies to make we'd make them better

63
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,949

64
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,599
day when I do make an actual legit movie

65
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,460
