getting this better than the other room

59
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,350
though realistically it's better than

60
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,180
the other room I think so

61
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,470
because it's bigger yeah the other one I

62
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:32,520
felt like I was stuck in a corner

63
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:35,700
bigger is better as they say what like

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,530
the other day the other day David and I

65
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,160

66
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,080

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,730
get society and become like a real thing

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,680
yeah and we're trying to make up a new

69
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,930
one we're trying to are the ones we were

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,160
saying we made up some ridiculous ones

71
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,140
like what are some sayings that are like

72
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,790
that's that's the thing that I always

73
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,320
want to look up but I can never find it

74
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,480

75
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,680

76
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,910
wait did you make that up or is that one

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,820
I made that up right now you gotta catch

78
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,580
your fish in the water I mean that I

79
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,250
guess I was watching an old like western

80
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,740
movie and one of the guys was saying

81
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,570
they were like old cowboy robbers and

82
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,920
they were like nah man that was back

83
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,940
when we were young and we were full of

84
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,950
beans I like that one that's a gallon

85
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,780
like man that got the beans like he'd if

86
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,510
he were watching em being do like a slam

87
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,970
does that mean though dude or just

88
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,310
energy powerful is full of be like his

89
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,910
beans are goofy you know maybe energy

90
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:38,670
yeah I don't know yeah or maybe he was

91
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:45,580
Filipino Filipino Philippines Latinos

92
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:48,820
oh well but our Filipino friends are the

93
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,640
ones who made that up it it might be but

94
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,020
on reg just because you're filipino does

95
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,060
not mean that you're full of beans

96
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,470
I always thought full of evil like if

97
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,750
you said man that person is full of

98
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,350
beans that they were like not telling

99
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,410
the truth

100
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:04,930
oh yeah that person is full of beans

101
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,100
yeah yeah but the way they said it they

102
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,080
were talking they were describing it

103
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,000
like a compliment like man that was back

104
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,000
when we were young and full of beans oh

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,580
like energy I guess beans are this is

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,220
the kind of stuff of energy I know that

107
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,579
that's what used to eat back in yeah the

108
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,759
way

109
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:25,379
and so sometimes sometime in society it

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,669
changed from full energy to full of poop

111
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:30,099
you're so full of poop and before that

112
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,139
is full of beans yep

113
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:35,590
what was it before hey that sounds like

114
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:37,599
a full of anything rice yeah so you're

115
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,340
so full of it dude you're full of beer

116
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:40,990
you know but maybe back then when they

117
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,020
would use that term you're full of

118
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,940
blight maybe it was a great thing like a

119
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,270

happy now now I'm like questioning no

122
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,909
it's it's a bad thing when I say to you

123
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:56,650
if I were seeing you like you guys are

124
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:58,240
full of full of they're full of it

125
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,740
you're full of joy that's a bad thing

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,080
that means you're a bullshitter

127
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,759
yeah what if you're full of joy you're

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,340
still full of it dude I would want to be

129
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,060
filled with joy David you're just full

130
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,690
of it bro

131
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,650
you're full of it but what's it though

132
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,659
it doesn't matter what it is it just

133
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,370
means you're full of it like you're

134
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:17,969
alive full of water well there was one

135
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,440
on what is the one that comes from like

136
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:23,620
God is so it sucks when I can't remember

137
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,490
references but it it comes from see if

138
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,340
you can figure out what this thing is

139
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,349
but it comes from the top of them when

140
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,810
they when you make milk oh the cream of

141
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,250
the crop that comes from when they make

142
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,469
milk or something like that and the top

143
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,360
of the milk was known as the the best

144
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,620
cream I guess a crop yeah so that's like

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,789
that's where that I had to look it I

146
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,279
looked it up because we were asking the

147
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:44,169
girl where does that even come from I'm

148
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,219
pretty sure that's that's correct I

149
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,590
might be wrong I think you're right

150
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:50,349
thing I googled it and then what is the

151
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,840
crop though is it milk it is milk right

152
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:55,509
I thought so yeah so maybe in the milk

153
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,250
when it separates the top is the cream

154
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:58,990
and that's the most valuable maybe it's

155
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,460
kind of like something here that you

156
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,430

playing the other night I was like man

184
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,089
this we should did this in the podcast

185
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,249
what's that is when you were asking if

186
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,399
we were doing like the would you rather

187
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:09,729
mmm

188
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,550
but it was a little r-rated yeah so if

189
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,689
we were to head out a little bit okay

190
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,300
all right everybody think of a would you

191
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:18,399
rather and we'll has really good all

192
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,169
right options you can start you go next

193
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,369
and I'll good last why do you get to go

194
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:25,989
last I got to think about would you

195
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:28,119
rather go first or second go ahead this

196
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:30,519
is a completely random one zombie

197
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:35,800
apocalypse would you rather have you

198
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:40,139
always go there a spear all right like a

199
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:43,389
long spear sharp yep durable or or a

200
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,800
fire axe like a you know what's a fire I

201
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,989
think you know the ones that you see

202
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,869
like a fireman's at fireman's axe yeah

203
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:54,759
oh I you know what I've held both okay

204
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:57,639
in my life jump out a spear and have

205
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:01,449
iraq's heard I felt I have held both

206
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:04,599
okay and experience referencing the

207
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:06,219
laziness of the people in Wally and me

208
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:08,019
wanting to be one of those people I

209
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:11,319
would choose a spear because it's a

210
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:13,449
little lighter honestly smart I would

211
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,369
also pick a spear but it's because of

212
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:17,229
the distance because they can only harm

213
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:19,300
you from touching you sure so if you

214
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:22,179
have a spear I would like in Walking

215
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,739
Dead I think it's easier to pierce them

216
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:25,959
yeah they make it look like they're made

217
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:27,849
of butter in Walking Dead like when they

218
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,929
stab people it's like okay I know you

219
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,610
stabbed a normal person it doesn't go

220
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:32,800
right through them like that or come out

221
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,179
as easy yeah well they are decomposed

222
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,479
how do you know that because I stabbed

223
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,960
people

224
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:42,279
I

225
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:45,980
people yeah here okay how about you acts

226
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:47,149
really because I could chop wood with it

227
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,890
that is also true

228
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:50,990
Zambia luckily we didn't think about

229
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:54,680
that but you know what you can't do go

230
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:59,510
spearfishing Oh too late you have an axe

231
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,490

232
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,050

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:26,149
pyramid shape and they're all 500 pounds

eat a rot in like a super expired taco

344
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:56,270
like that the meat is all disgusting and

345
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:59,240
moldy and like the lettuce and the

346
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,310
cheese is all like super old I mean

347
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,250

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,150
organisms mm-hmm science that can

350
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,920
definitely damage your body and

351
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,480
potentially kill you but you have to

352
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,870

353
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,540
point

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,080
be dry versus like all's grind spory

363
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,630
yeah you gotta think she's kind of in

364
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,420
the sandwich yeah only one ingredient is

365
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,980
disgusting which is what doc boom all

366
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,110
right everything else is a fresh bread

367
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,360
fresh there's lettuce and tomato fresh

368
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:48,020
cheese yes a sandwich a simple disaster

369
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,720

371
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,560
piece poop it's like it's much like you

00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,930
know if you take a piece of roast beef

373
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,540
yeah it would be like a couple pieces or

374
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:02,240
maybe like a short ride this is exactly

375
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,779
why we have more megameters dry or it

376
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,270

like dog poop salary stench to it okay

381
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,589
from experience of smelling dog poop

sandwich you know what I might take the

383
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:26,869
dog poop because I I know that with food

00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:28,549
that has spoiled yeah

385
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:29,989
it's extremely dangerous and you could

386
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:32,720
die from like salmonella poisoning

387
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:34,100

388
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,449
you know any a food poisoning yeah

389
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,639
that's just from eating like a little

390
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:39,319
bit of like young guy but imagine if it

391
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,679

rather die dude rather enjoy that

394
00:15:48,230 --> 00:16:03,100
sandwich there's that game and that was

395
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:11,779
I like that game

396
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:13,279
it'll get better as we get better at it

397
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,079
yeah well next time we'll be prepared

398
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,089
for it we're new is using thinking about

399
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,879
new be podcast trips well I was trying

400
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:22,189
to think of it but it is a tough part is

401
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,809
keeping it clean mm-hmm but maybe it

402
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,040
doesn't have to we can do we can do

403
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:26,600
clean ones that are interesting why

404
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,069
don't you do a vote what do you think

405
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,829
people would say keep it clean or keep

406
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:33,169
it keep it dirty I think it's a dirty

407
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:34,220
they would but it's but like what's the

408
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:36,169
point if everything gets like

409
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,449
age-restricted injury sponsor this is

410
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,860
what this is what that is well that as

411
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:42,709
well but that's not even the issue is

412
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,850
the age restriction yeah it's YouTube's

413
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:48,259
got into this place

414
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,939
mmm we always end up oh yeah it always

415
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,660
see the fact that we are even talking

416
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:55,129
about this

417
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:56,720
shows what's wrong with you - that's

418
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:58,549
deep right it is it's true though

419
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,350
because yeah I never used to feel like

420
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:02,360
this even writing anything like I was

421
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,730
always clean yeah like consciously but

422
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,339
like I never felt like I couldn't be

423
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,679
yourself yeah where it's like and they

424
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,899
promote the whole be yourself thing they

425
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,819
do promote that but it's like okay well

426
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:16,760
be yourself would be the the self that

427
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:19,159
we want exactly yeah the fact that it's

428
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,679
so that's is even that it's exhausting

429
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:24,919
to talk about shows you there's a

430
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,089
problem with it yeah there's no way we

431
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,350
could do that would you rather as we did

432
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:32,240
last night without

433
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:34,490
me there's no way yeah yeah what's new

434
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,820
we you need a new platform so do we want

435
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,470
to talk about YouTube not really do you

436
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,120
want to talk about you - we can talk

437
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,010
about it but I don't want to buy you -

438
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,549
everybody's always just complaining you

439
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:47,929
- I'm American they forced us to hide

440
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:49,340
their nose it you know what I tried

441
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:51,260
deleting it from my phone you can't but

442
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,990
every time I go I turn on my bluetooth

443
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,309
in my car yuichi starts playing and I'm

444
00:17:53,990 --> 00:18:00,049
like this what is this great music

445
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:01,970
that's playing what is this great music

446
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:04,010
that's not an epistle actually I'm very

447
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,350
yeah I really don't like the fact that

448
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:09,559
it's playing like Otto plays and Michael

449
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:12,530
yeah it's I don't know what you do it's

450
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,750
upsetting stop using Apple yeah anyway

451
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,850
products yeah just shows everyone is

452
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:21,679
biased and they have their own agendas

453
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:22,940
to push myself you're just talking about

454
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,280
like the whole Apple thing the other day

455
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,570
and like we were comparing like the

456
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,190
sides of like you can see it from

457
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,530
Apple's perspective or like we were

458
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,200
talking about how we'll see yeah and

459
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:36,250
also how it they I think they tried to

460
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,140
like literally stop the market of

461
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,730
third-party repairs and they like they

462
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,860
would like sue these other small

463
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,179
companies that were doing that and I

464
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,890
know there's a youtuber online that like

465
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:48,679
shows all the information of like he

466
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,570
takes apart Apple products and says like

467
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,640
they were gonna charge you $600 for this

468
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,020
it literally cost $2 and this is how you

469
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,900
do it and they were trying to take it

470
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:00,350
down mm-hmm but on the flip side with

471
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,030
the other argument is that because Apple

472
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,039
is you know they want to control your

473
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,990
experience right which is good and a bad

474
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:08,179
thing right it's it's positive because

475
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:12,530
they they maintain a very high quality

476
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:14,120
level of service product design all

477
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,520
these things and they want people to

478
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,440
join their world and say hey we have

479
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,600
this amazing experience that you can

480
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,230
have going to the Apple Genius Bar these

481
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,059
products are 100% you know tested in our

482
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,340
facilities right with our highest

483
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:30,919
quality of standards whereas these third

484
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,230
parties may take a shortcut they may you

485
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,720
know find the same part in China that's

486
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,000
you know super cheap but on the other

487
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,820
side not everyone can afford these

488
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,769
ridiculous prices

489
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:46,659
yeah I was a repair so I can see kind of

490
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:48,039
both sides mm-hmm right you know what do

491
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:49,299
you think about that no I just we were

492
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,659
talking about the other day oh really

493
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:53,470
like off like somewhere I mean I get it

494
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:55,960
nicely politicize too

495
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,179
yeah but I mean I just no matter what

496
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,799
yeah I think no matter what though like

497
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:02,619
with anything not just Apple YouTube

498
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,169
everything no you can't satisfy everyone

499
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:06,909
yeah and the thing is most people don't

500
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:08,679
think in the same way where we're

501
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:10,269
thinking from their perspective and like

502
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,749
if you were to from a business person's

503
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:15,279
perspective but put yourself in their

504
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:16,509
shoes if you're starting a business or

505
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,099
you're doing things a certain way

506
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:19,349
I mean if you really believe you know

507
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:22,090
what's best and start your own business

508
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:24,609
goal rival Apple if you know that much

509
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,899
yeah I think that's I mean you can

510
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:28,239
complain as much as we want about

511
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:29,409
YouTube and stuff but if they're not

512
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:31,659
willing to change that's why I've

513
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:32,889
stopped trying to change there's no way

514
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:34,450
you can change you too they're too big

515
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:37,809
right so if they want to make it this

516
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,549
way you have to adjust it sucks but the

517
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:41,769
only way we can show we can do anything

518
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:43,570
about it is either people stop using it

519
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:45,479
cuz it's not good or there's a

520
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,590
competitor right and they're just so big

521
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:49,179
it's hard to compete with the company

522
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,159
that's generating billions of dollars

523
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,409
they have a monopoly on this system I'm

524
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,479
on both sides I but I I would yeah I get

525
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:58,149
it certainly for me I'm actually a

526
00:20:55,479 --> 00:21:00,519
little more on the other side as far as

527
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:02,289
the experience mm-hmm because I mean

528
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:04,659
first off I am an Apple fanboy but I

529
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:07,119
also the reason why I am is because I

530
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:09,970
actually love their products now do they

531
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:13,809
charge a ton of money for like their

532
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:16,869
laptops and their phones yes they do it

533
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:19,479
is more expensive and but they've done

534
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:23,139
an amazing job of branding in marketing

535
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:24,909
which is what which is a little bit that

536
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:26,470
that doesn't hold that much weight

537
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,359
because marketing can mean it's all

538
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,989
about like kind of manipulation right in

539
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:34,629
a way but I do think that Apple products

540
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:37,720
like because I guess I come from like

541
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:39,720
the artistic side right and creative

542
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,389
side like when I see an Apple product

543
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,190
versus anything else for me personally I

544
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:47,830
see it as like oh wow this is a

545
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:50,200
beautiful thing like yeah it's clean

546
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,420
it's clean it's consistent and I guess

547
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,030
that aligns with like my

548
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,370
which you somewhat OCD kind of like but

549
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,700
he's oh yeah like even like I think cuz

550
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,260
I for me even just walking around you

551
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,510
know like town square or a mall or

552
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,430
something and you see an Apple store it

553
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,680
just looks so clean yeah and for me I

554
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,210
personally hate the heat something like

555
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,000
that looks so cleaning cold I just want

556
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,800
to go in there you know what hold it

557
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,840
it's not a warm that kind of place it's

558
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,150
not a warm place it's like always leak

559
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,860
very sleek I know it's gonna be cold in

560
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,990
there so that's where I go if it was

561
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,050
always freezing I grew up like if I grew

562
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,310
up in the Arctic then I would probably

563
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:29,170
go into something that looks more like a

564
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,580
warm home they're like Hollister yeah

565
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,870
even though holidays are really cold but

566
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,360
it looks like a house yeah something

567
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:38,860
more like bright and I guess I don't

568
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:40,750
know what's a warm looking store like I

569
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,670
think Hollister is pretty good looks

570
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,070
like a log cabin but it's very dark

571
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,720
though and dark looks cold - that's your

572
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:50,050
Abercrombie & Fitch that's another

573
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,550
that's the same thing do you mean the

574
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:57,970
buy warm store I could say orange

575
00:22:51,550 --> 00:23:00,430
brownish yeah yeah yeah that's just a

576
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,560
visual that's a visual my cycle it's

577
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,780
psychology yeah so yeah like going back

578
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,070
to that I just I'm a big fan of it I

579
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,380
know people are gonna disagree me like

580
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,060
no like Samsung's better and whatnot you

581
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,830
know what I've seen Samsung phones are

582
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,510
great mm-hmm actually technology wise

583
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,580
there are a lot more advanced in a lot

584
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:19,060
of ways right they actually like try to

585
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:21,850
improve and do all these things but once

586
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,640
you do too much of that it may allow

587
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:28,960
other people other you know there's too

588
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:32,380
many ideas in that phone in my opinion

589
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,490
and in just the general direction and is

590
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,830
what what I'm talking about

591
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,660
right I don't you mean hey and and it

592
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,640
gets a little clunky and a little bit

593
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,190
like what so what are you guys exactly

594
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,560
what what are you trying to I know what

595
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:47,020
you're trying to do but like where's

596
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,710
your identity that's how my mind works

597
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,720
right I think once some of these other

598
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,930
competitors they start branding better

599
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,580
and they have more of a design sense in

600
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,230
terms of like the product and the way

601
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,510
that they package everything together

602
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,580
that's that's a type of thing I have

603
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,350
appreciation for oh yeah I mean I

604
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,510
literally just went through like getting

605
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,850
the Apple watch and so I went through

606
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,080
like the looking through the market and

607
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,330
seemed like what am i other opportunity

608
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,539
or other options I guess yeah and it was

609
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:19,900
basically just like either do Android

610
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:22,360
mm-hmm or you do smart walk or the Apple

611
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,429
watch hmm and I will say after I went

612
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,929
and got the Apple watch the packaging

613
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,730
and everything like I opened it I was

614
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:29,020
like this is pretty sick like just

615
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,990
opening it I was like yeah and they

616
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:34,059
really control that whole expansion to

617
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,590
detail which is I appreciate like you

618
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:38,230
said that coming from like an artistic

619
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,909
minds yeah like perspective like even

620
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,710
like on the back side you know they had

621
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:43,210
like a print on the inside that you

622
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,190
couldn't even see until you open it it

623
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,900
was just very that part was very and

624
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,150
it's consistent with all not just their

625
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,390
watch but like yeah product yeah I sound

626
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:54,909
like a Apple sales guy right now

627
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,830
would you say that so it's interesting

628
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:59,020
because and I just thought about this

629
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,820
now but like wouldn't so you're kind of

630
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:05,350
saying that Samsung is met like in a way

631
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:07,150
it's Messier and Apple is cleaner right

632
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,409
that's what you're saying kinda to a

633
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:11,380
certain degree when you look at it I

634
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:14,440
usually I kind of am right but they're

635
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,000
okay so so I made my point for Apple and

636
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,900
their beauty and all that right the

637
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,270
other side that I think is great about

638
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,730
you know companies like Google and you

639
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:29,490
know basically Android phones is that

640
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:33,010
they they push innovation right and and

641
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:36,520
they actually allow people to kind of

642
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:38,320
freely be creative and do their own

643
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,590
things as opposed to conforming to what

644
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,840
Apple's brand standards are right right

645
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,090
like so Apple says we built this you

646
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,490
need to build according to this yeah

647
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,940
right mm-hmm the Google kind of mindset

648
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,289
is like hey this is an open field you be

649
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,990
as creative as you want you build

650
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:58,030
whatever you want and in here you go

651
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,760
my thing is I wish that there was a

652
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:02,919
company that literally promotes both of

653
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,710
those it's hard but I mean like in a

654
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,780
sense of like it's an open thing but the

655
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,340
experience is still very important and

656
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,840
like the sleek look and something like

657
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,940
that you know I mean I don't I

658
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,450
the problem I have is like it's very

659
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,810
much one or the other you know it's like

660
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,370
red and blue

661
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,760
you know take the red pill or the blue

662
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:27,130
pill yep she's a red side or the blue

663
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:31,190
side but I was really excited for

664
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:33,260
Google's modular phone I don't think

665
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,490
they're do any more pics not the picture

666
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,020
I don't remember what it was but it was

667
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,620
like I remember there was like a very

668
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:41,420
big buzz about having like a phone where

669
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,550
instead of replacing the phone you

670
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,170
replaced upgraded components almost like

671
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,840
a motherboard in a computer oh I see

672
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,640
yeah and so it would reduce electronic

673
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,230
waste and it would reduce like the

674
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,150
consumers cost because they didn't have

675
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,910
to continually so I was like oh we came

676
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:57,830
out with a 30 megapixel camera

677
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,930
you know here buy it and then you just

678
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,430
pop it out like a card and you punch it

679
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,140
back in and you essentially just

680
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:05,780
upgraded your phone to a certain degree

681
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,430
yeah I don't I I see it why you won't

682
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,380
make as much money yeah because you're

683
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:11,450
not forcing the consumer to buy an

684
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:14,390
actual phone right the entire thing so

685
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,160
business from a business perspective it

686
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,690
would make no it wouldn't make as much

687
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,540
sense because why would I want to

688
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,980
upgrade it if I'm if I have this right

689
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,150
well yeah I mean I'm not saying it's

690
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,150
gonna make money I was just saying like

691
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,830
for me personally that I'd but it is

692
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:30,920
cool yeah yeah like that is like an

693
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,810
innovative idea that pushes the industry

694
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,430
you know yeah yeah it does it does which

695
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,960
is why I think some people had like

696
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,460
problems with Apple because I feel like

697
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,830
in the beginning they were very much

698
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,330
like an innovative idea Steve Jobs was

699
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,620
around yeah and now it's just kind of

700
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,600
like like you were saying they've kind

701
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,760
of scaled back to just the experience or

702
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,580
having like this brand that they keep

703
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,710
consistent which is still pretty pretty

704
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,380
cool and it's it is kind of like it is a

705
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,120
slightly more shallow type of thing you

706
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,980
know the branding and all that I mean

707
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,180
it's very important because the branding

708
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:04,850
it's more of a psychological thing yeah

709
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:09,200
the actual innovation of Technology I

710
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:11,630
think you know Android and Google is

711
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,880
that they've done a much better job of

712
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,740
like pushing that yeah and then Apple

713
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,290
just kind of copies what they did right

714
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:22,160
yeah but they perfect it yeah packaged

715
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:25,820
it better so so yeah at the end of the

716
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,440
day androids a lot better another thing

717
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,730
is weird too is like when I was thinking

718
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,000
like do I want to switch to Android

719
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:34,020
mm-hmm

720
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,970
no out because everyone has I phones if

721
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,250
I were the only one that doesn't have

722
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,890
one well in our group yeah like a

723
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:44,100
message for what we do I think it's

724
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:46,470
easier but if we all were to switch or

725
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,080
say you were like the minority right

726
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:52,320
with a iPhone I think it's an easy

727
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,060
switch you mean iPhone to Android no I

728
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,580
think the only reason I'm still getting

729
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,290
iPhones is because it's easier it's got

730
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,120
a everyone already has it cuz they've

731
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,800
created this whole ecosystem they did

732
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,360
yeah that's brilliant yeah and you look

733
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,090
at really you look at iMessage for

734
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,910
example yeah if you text each other I'm

735
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,840
with iMessage I'm on iPhones it's a nice

736
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:15,300
blue and white or blue and gray kind of

737
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,610
messaging visual but when you message

738
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,770
with anyone outside of Apple you get

739
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,330
this like neon green thing that just

740
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,690
yeah look good it's like kind of ugly

741
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:27,180
and Android they do it on purpose and

742
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,950
it's color of droid I hate that I think

743
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,330
they do it on purpose I mean yeah it's a

744
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,010
brilliant idea to click like you said an

745
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,470
ecosystem that's a very good word to do

746
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:38,970
and I hate it yeah I'm in it I'm stuck

747
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,630
in it yeah yeah they got us on a hook

748
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,060
yeah

749
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,770
so they can do things that I hate and I

750
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,180
will still be loyal because I mean not

751
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,130
loyal I have to it's just out of

752
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,320
convenience yeah I like the whole like

753
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,310
when a new phone comes out I don't know

754
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,020
there was a study I don't know if it's

755
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,780
true or not but I personally know for a

756
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,190
fact that always happens like every time

757
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,290
when you phone comes out my phone for

758
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:01,370
whatever reason I would say the last

759
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:04,350
four phones consistently get slower and

760
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,520
maybe I think there was a study or

761
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,530
something about it

762
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,820
maybe it's an update they released I

763
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,860
don't know what it is but whenever like

764
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,260
it's not my phone it's not that old

765
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,420
well didn't a police a statement saying

766
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:19,070
they do slow down older phones they do

767
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:22,950
they do and the reason being is because

768
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:26,010
you know because then because with the

769
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:28,530
new phone right the hardware you have to

770
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:31,290
release new software right and software

771
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,850
generally gets better right it doesn't

772
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,200
get more slimmed down it gets bulkier

773
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,880
right so when you have a bulky or

774
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,980
software with more features and more

775
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,750
more tools and different you know

776
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,970
powerful phone can't handle it your

777
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,520
phone can't handle it because it's not

778
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,530
as powerful as right

779
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,870
new phone that comes ok so so when you

780
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,430
come out with the new software right you

781
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,870
have an old phone the old phones

782
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,180
Hardware can't keep up with the software

783
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:56,630
so it disables certain things in the

784
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:59,980
hardware sure or in the software or vice

785
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:02,390
versa right that so so it forces you to

786
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,530
but that's my point though like that's

787
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,600
my point like the fact that they're

788
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,340
releasing this every single and there's

789
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,980
not much change they could have you know

790
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,570
for a fact that Apple has so many things

791
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,010
that they're currently working on that's

792
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,750
not gonna be in the in the next phone

793
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,980
yeah I think they hold stuff back and

794
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,940
they're doing it because they want to

795
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,050
release more phones because they know

796
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,070
that you have to get the next one

797
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,450
because your phone is gonna slow down

798
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,090
and can't handle it when they could have

799
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,200
easily done something that they could

800
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,780
have released a version that could

801
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,220
handle the next update if not then why

802
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,480
don't they have somebody thinking about

803
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,220
that like why don't they have somebody

804
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,150
like saying because everybody's

805
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,670
complaining about it there's other

806
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:37,490
conspiracies about how they're doing

807
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:39,890
this to your phones yeah like they are

808
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:41,510
aware of the problem they've already

809
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:45,770
addressed it I think it's less about

810
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:47,240
that it's more about its it's like if

811
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,280
you had a restaurant right and then you

812
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,780
decide to change so you had customers

813
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,610
coming for a decade

814
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,320
they're so used to like everything on

815
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,050
the menu and the way that the chairs

816
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,520
feel and then one day they're like ok

817
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,110
you know what from a business

818
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,060
perspective we got to evolve with the

819
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:03,620
times where people are getting more

820
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,880
sophisticated you know we don't want to

821
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:09,380
just serve this like this the same

822
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,600
patrons that come into our you know a

823
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,490
restaurant we want the young kids to

824
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,220
come but our place looks old yeah so

825
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,640
bringing in all these new furniture but

826
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,600
you can't really do half in half because

827
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,910
it's just gonna be weird with the

828
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,800
branding and all that but if you if you

829
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,540
have the same you know if you bring in a

830
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,530
bunch of new furniture and make it look

831
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,080
more hip because you want to draw the

832
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:31,970
audience and the old people you know

833
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,250
they're gonna complain because it's not

834
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:35,990
as a hip and forward-thinking so that's

835
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,300
that's the difference though this is not

836
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,980
like when you're going into this

837
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,850
restaurant for the old people mm-hmm

838
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:46,250
like they're not they're not allowed to

839
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:48,500
like you can still go there for free

840
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,690
mmm like you're not being forced to do

841
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,220
something that you don't want to do yeah

842
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,690
like it's not like the it's it's not

843
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,490
like you're destroying that restaurant

844
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,770
you have my analogy is and then making

845
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,020
you pay for another play

846
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,760
yeah but like their what they're doing

847
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,040
is they're saying like hey you bought

848
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,230
this from us right yeah no no it doesn't

849
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,550
work the same way yeah but you have to

850
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,160
upgrade you can't not upgrade right

851
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,570
eventually it makes you upgrade yeah if

852
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,490
they were to let you just let your form

853
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,140
work the way it is like it my my phone

854
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,610
worked the way it did yeah

855
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,580
like how I bought it and how it was

856
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:20,200
intended to work mm-hmm I don't care let

857
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,430
me you can have the coolest stuff the

858
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,990
next one I'll get the next one after

859
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,630
that maybe yeah but the fact that

860
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:27,610
they're making you get this product the

861
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,960
next product because they ruin your

862
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,430
other your previous product but they're

863
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,350
not really is a response but they're not

864
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,610
really making you fit whether or not

865
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,850
they are making you because they're

866
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,650
there if it switch to Android well

867
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,120
that's what I mean but like out of

868
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,740
convene it's it's messed that's why I'm

869
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,450
saying it's messed up but like I didn't

870
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,070
I have to stay with they're

871
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,130
intentionally making the product you

872
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:49,210
bought like obsolete so that you have to

873
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,010
say no I don't I don't think it's that

874
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,690
no no that's what you're saying like I

875
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:55,530
don't mean if it's not even if it's not

876
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,620
intentional they're not they don't care

877
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:01,420
because about their you know they're

878
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,550
because her in does he care about moving

879
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,590
consumers they care about improving

880
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,870
technology they care about not being

881
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:09,669
stuck in the past but like moving on to

882
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,919
better and newer things because that's

883
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:13,300
what their job is right but it's you

884
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,159
know they're doing it on purpose because

885
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,380
like you said I mean yeah considering

886
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,240
you're developing an app you know that

887
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:22,480
when they put an update yeah they are

888
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:25,960
forcing other people who have apps to

889
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,300
conform to their update yeah so because

890
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,240
you suck it could be just as simple to

891
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:33,669
help to fix Ryan's problem would be if

892
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,970
you have a phone that's let's say the

893
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:39,159
six it caps at a certain update so that

894
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:41,800
then when you don't upgrade into the

895
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,179
next software to mess up your phone so

896
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,450
you could say like well you could buy a

897
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:48,550
six but it only goes up to software XYZ

898
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:50,169
right and so it won't it won't get

899
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:53,040
messed up but usually few features of

900
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:55,899
the new one so they do they do do that

901
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,130
within the software itself they have to

902
00:34:55,899 --> 00:35:02,560
but I guess I mean I'm not an engineer

903
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,660
but from what I understand is if you

904
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,020
create how do I explain this so if you

905
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:10,630
create a new software update it's

906
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,480
addressing certain bugs but it's also

907
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,890
helping the new phone it's a it's a

908
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,560
software that fits into the hardware of

909
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:20,200
the new phones that come out right right

910
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,960
new and better better better and faster

911
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,600
and more powerful right an overall

912
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,660
update it's an overall update now for

913
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,720
Apple to spend their resources and their

914
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,910
engineering power on creating and they

915
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,820
do already have this they have an iPhone

916
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,140
16 right now right for all the iPhones

917
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,970
right even though we're on iPhone 10

918
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:43,150
right but then how long are they gonna

919
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,380
keep this going and have people fix bugs

920
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,200
that are still appearing in time from

921
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:49,150
six they want to move on to the next

922
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,250
phones they want to get it more so what

923
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,720
you're saying is Wendy so the bugs that

924
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:54,160
they're fixing right and like on the

925
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,660
iPhone which are always there yeah yeah

926
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,070
they're always there but like if you're

927
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,560
satisfied with how your phone is when

928
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:03,700
you buy it yeah which you know if it can

929
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:05,200
run that way can they maintain that that

930
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,340
current farm even with the bugs that are

931
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,840
currently there but that's what you

932
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,700
bought like that's what the phone is

933
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,910
that's fine so the thing with the

934
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,800
convenient een so here's the thing so

935
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:18,190
from Apple's perspective why would they

936
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:25,120
put spend millions and millions of

937
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:27,730
dollars more into a software into a team

938
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,690
that just cares about that's what I'm

939
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,040
asking because they need an

940
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,870
accessibility because they don't make up

941
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,100
money then they would they need another

942
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,420
team they need another so then that's

943
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,190
then that's what I'm saying yeah it

944
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,310
makes no sense financial then what they

945
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:41,830
should do is I mean I guess it then it

946
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:43,660
becomes this point is at what point like

947
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:46,300
is there really if they really wanted to

948
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:49,810
so by this logic why not just release a

949
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,820
new phone every month and force you to

950
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,590
why a new phone they do health software

951
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,360
but not know but why not just a new

952
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:57,460
phone every month and you'd force it's

953
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,470
too expensive exactly but for a lot of

954
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,000
people it's too expensive already

955
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,710
because of how frequently they're

956
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,450
releasing phones and that's the point

957
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,280
they need to make something that and

958
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,510
this is only I mean you don't have to do

959
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,250
whatever they want yeah but I'm saying

960
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,840
like the more this happens and the more

961
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,240
frequently this happens the more I'm

962
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,830
gonna try and compete the campaign yeah

963
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,540
until people like I'm ready to switch

964
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,430
I'm until all my friends and then as far

965
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,560
as Apple's perspective is if they don't

966
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,600
release phones at this rate yeah then

967
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,780
they have to lay people off yeah which

968
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,070
is fine like this

969
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,900
if that's the way they're gonna yeah if

970
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,760
that's the way they're gonna be like

971
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,900
their company yeah I get it like I

972
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,430
understand it but that's just how it

973
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,040
works like if you people can't afford it

974
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,780
and it keeps coming out like we're

975
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,250
fortunate that we can afford it but if

976
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,810
it keeps coming out what's stopping them

977
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,310
from going every single month and the

978
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,750
next time the next month it comes out

979
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,160
your phone starts getting slower after

980
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,020
that your phone gets even slower than

981
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,940
that like there's nothing stopping them

982
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,530
other than it's not a good idea now it's

983
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,000
it's like you know I'll go back to the

984
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:53,060
restaurant analogy let's say you're max

985
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,740
max capacity every night right and you

986
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,480
hire people and then you're you've hired

987
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,600
enough people to to have a good business

988
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,860
right it comes down to capitalism right

989
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,460
do you want to create more jobs for

990
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,170
people

991
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,640
mm-hmm right if you're at the top of

992
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,770
this restaurant in your max capacity

993
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,100
every night and you're you make a

994
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:11,870
certain amount of money right it's like

995
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,010
should this company be able to open

996
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,000
you're not worried they're not worried

997
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,040
about other people they're worried about

998
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,750
themselves no that's what I mean yeah

999
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,410
they're not worried about people losing

1000
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:23,360
their jobs um trust they're not worried

1001
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:25,910
about it don't worry but it would happen

1002
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,380
no because if you really were worried

1003
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,120
about and you weren't being selfish what

1004
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,500
you would do is what you exactly what

1005
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,300
you said you create another team right

1006
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,940
it cost them more money yeah but it'll

1007
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,350
keep their people happy people like me

1008
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,730
and will that will have the oath not

1009
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,830
just me and will but like I'm saying

1010
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,510
like for this is my example yeah yeah

1011
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,040
they would create another team which

1012
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,750
creates more jobs cost them more money

1013
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,940
right but it's like are they the ones

1014
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,320
they're gonna lose money but they're

1015
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,730
people are hacked their customers are

1016
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,580
happier I think this goes into a much

1017
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:54,050
deeper conversation about capitalism so

1018
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,580
like let's say you have this restaurant

1019
00:38:54,050 --> 00:39:02,150
right and you were doing your making um

1020
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:03,680
ten million dollars a year right they

1021
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:07,880
could open another restaurant another

1022
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:11,420
chain and open another one and then they

1023
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:14,360
can open a franchise and become the next

1024
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,820
in and out the next chick-fil-a the next

1025
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,860
whatever that depends on their goal now

1026
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,350
with this phone company do they want to

1027
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,910
just be a mom-and-pop like phone shop or

1028
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,200
do they want to compete with Samsung and

1029
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,270
all these other companies do they want

1030
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,520
to change the world sure they want to

1031
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:30,050
have influence over a country do they

1032
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,330
want to influence around the world and

1033
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:35,780
who doesn't want and be in and kind of

1034
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:37,190
have you know create create this like

1035
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,980
brand that's rep

1036
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:42,710
since America and American goods right

1037
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,839
that gives you influence and power over

1038
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,309
all the other countries in terms of

1039
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:48,200
Technology you want to be a leader in

1040
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:49,640
that you can't be a leader if you don't

1041
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,230
expand and if you don't expand you're

1042
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,490
not generating more revenue of course

1043
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,619
and you can't you will never have that

1044
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,960
that sort of it's a balancing act yeah

1045
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:59,270
but what I'm saying is and they're

1046
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,890
getting to the point where I think

1047
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,329
they're not gonna generate more revenue

1048
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:05,030
they can't they're done right now

1049
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:06,740
actually so as far as phones mm-hmm most

1050
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:10,490
people in the they've already kind of

1051
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:12,289
like maxed out the number of people who

1052
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:14,359
can buy phones from Apple because

1053
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:16,160
everyone has iPhones but I mean like

1054
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:17,750
there's always gonna be kids and people

1055
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,910
growing like there's populations

1056
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,640
increasingly yeah yeah but not not at

1057
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,990
the rate where it's like what's worth it

1058
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,880
that's why right now they're focusing on

1059
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,920
software upgrades as opposed to hardware

1060
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,690
right right because everybody already

1061
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,730
has an iPhone so you're like how often

1062
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:33,470
you know but you just sit like oh I

1063
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,020
guess if they're at the maximum like the

1064
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:38,289
perfect device which doesn't exist then

1065
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,339
that one can handle the most updates

1066
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:41,839
like the because you're not building new

1067
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:43,400
phones yeah I have to build a new phone

1068
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,319
it's because they have updates that

1069
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,420
can't be handled there's there's a rest

1070
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:49,130
of things so are they done making new

1071
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,569
phones I don't think they are

1072
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,579
oh no no no they're never done making

1073
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:54,200
new phones but yeah but they're having

1074
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,549
like within the latest iPhone that came

1075
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,410
out yeah you had the least amount of

1076
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:59,240
buzz because everyone has an iPhone like

1077
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,369
I'll wait it out for the next next next

1078
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,529
next right cuz I'm happy wait wait you

1079
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:05,089
can't though because when the next one

1080
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:07,819
comes out your phone's not gonna stop

1081
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:09,890
working once you update yeah I think

1082
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:11,480
that's what I'm saying that's um I would

1083
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,700
say this is somewhat of a simple

1084
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,710
solution but it's kind of like a

1085
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,450
compromise between them having a team

1086
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,750
and the team moving on or whatever it

1087
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,240
may be

1088
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,920
yeah but when they have a phone in the

1089
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,859
beginning when you buy a brand new phone

1090
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,839
it has bugs and people are like yeah fix

1091
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:28,880
this fix this and then in like a year

1092
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:31,220
later maybe two years later it gets to a

1093
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,470
point where it works good and you want

1094
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:36,520
to keep it the exact way it is even if

1095
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:40,130
it has like maybe one bug here it's very

1096
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:43,119
solid doable yeah yeah there's a problem

1097
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,680
when it switches over to the new phone

1098
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,359
that everyone complains again or says

1099
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,030
screw it I'm gonna buy a new phone there

1100
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,730
needs to be a way to like solidify so

1101
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:56,960
so in that zone that phone will not slow

1102
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:58,220
down if you don't upgrade - OH - what my

1103
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,720
knots really buggy

1104
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,580
I don't even update that when you don't

1105
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,040
update 100% that's all we're talking

1106
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,600
about actually okay there's something to

1107
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,570
be said about that that's probably true

1108
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:11,000
in some ways yeah because at that point

1109
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:14,180
Apple is already invested in improving

1110
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,910
their overall system the backend not

1111
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,680
necessary that one update yeah iPhone 6

1112
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:22,730
software but the entire back-end

1113
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:25,190
infrastructure because they need to grow

1114
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,290
right to make better things they may

1115
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,230
know AR as a future and they need to

1116
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:31,490
build and hoarding Lea now that doesn't

1117
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,990
make sense maybe it does slow down a

1118
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:35,690
little bit yeah yeah but that's the

1119
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:37,610
problem is for the consumers like I see

1120
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,890
where Ryan well Ryan says about if I buy

1121
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:41,930
a phone at this one point and it's

1122
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:44,450
working up to the standards that you as

1123
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:48,320
a consumer want it - mm-hmm

1124
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:51,620
it's kind of like I would say again the

1125
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,450
word I'm using a slimy that the company

1126
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,420
isn't really like doing something

1127
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:59,120
actively for that for that specific

1128
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:01,220
problem right and the reason is you know

1129
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,810
it's money they want you to essentially

1130
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,920
it's not as you can't argue against it

1131
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,150
the earlier you don't upgrade your phone

1132
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,190
it's just not a priority well they

1133
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,660
should just disclose yeah hey this phone

1134
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,130
only lasts a year until it starts

1135
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,910
slowing down you know what that the same

1136
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:15,890
problem it's the same exact problem that

1137
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:19,040
every phone company has whether your

1138
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:22,040
Apple or Android Samsung it's the same

1139
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,930
thing it Apple just gets that that sort

1140
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,720
of you know well I don't I don't know

1141
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:28,490
that because yeah it's no it is because

1142
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,540
that's how software I can't even say

1143
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,760
that agree with that because I don't

1144
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,530
know yeah I don't yeah I'm speaking from

1145
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,750
personal experience because there's no

1146
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:37,670
there was no release telling us this

1147
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,560
until recently right and I always

1148
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:41,810
suspect it I always I called it out in

1149
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,190
videos a long time ago and then this

1150
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:45,650
article came out within the last I don't

1151
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:46,820
know year or so yeah cuz some heart did

1152
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,430
some Harvard study or something like

1153
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:51,620
that but I when that came out I was not

1154
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,330
I was shocked even though I knew it was

1155
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,830
happening I just didn't know that's just

1156
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,420
a conspiracy I'm just it's in my head

1157
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,950
like yeah yeah you know but it makes

1158
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,720
sense cuz I'm like man I have to spend

1159
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,980
money again I just got this could I I

1160
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,350
don't get phone when they just come out

1161
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,550
yeah yeah I mean I just got I forget

1162
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:08,540
when it was and could have been the five

1163
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:10,520
or six it just like it just came out

1164
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,870
like well I'm standing and then two

1165
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,920
months later next week and my phone

1166
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,780
stopped working because for me there's

1167
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,310
no excuse that this phone that's one

1168
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,080
soul should stop working for that price

1169
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,240
yeah well that's that's a different

1170
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,400
that's it probably the phone itself but

1171
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,850
like for example I'm honest I've known

1172
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,340
seven okay my phone works completely

1173
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:31,250
fine and are now yes update for now so

1174
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:33,920
for me I'm like I know some people have

1175
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,940
that problem of where their slows down a

1176
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,650
lot yeah

1177
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:41,510
but why not me maybe maybe just for your

1178
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,250
phone I don't know see so that's why

1179
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:46,040
maybe it's not maybe it is but it's just

1180
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:48,230
in your not slowing down it's not really

1181
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,180
it's fast enough for me too

1182
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:52,100
so then what we're saying that it's not

1183
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,930
then it is just they have faulty

1184
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,460
products like a lot of it could be that

1185
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,560
it could be that because most people I

1186
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:00,620
know agree with what we're talking about

1187
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:02,960
mine what really creeped me out was mine

1188
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:04,550
only started messing up I mean this is

1189
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,650
gonna sound like huge conspiracy yeah

1190
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:09,050
mine only started like getting really

1191
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:11,270
glitchy when they started having new

1192
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:13,850
releases and I was watching videos on

1193
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:15,640
the new phones and radix and that's when

1194
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,930
I was like this is weird but that's

1195
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,820
there is like I mean there's already

1196
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:22,430
talked about that with whole like Alexa

1197
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,560
and that's Amazon and yeah Google home

1198
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:26,180
and there's already like things again

1199
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,100
and your phone there's that Sunspear see

1200
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,480
and it's and it's been proven and I'm

1201
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,430
people have tested it yeah like not

1202
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,870
simple like slow down I'm talking like I

1203
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:34,460
would type I'd be typing that's

1204
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:37,190
Facebook's thing and it wouldn't type

1205
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:39,140
and then it would go that's what I had

1206
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:41,030
anyone like and they would type like

1207
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,410
really fast yeah it would and it would

1208
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,850
like interesting and there was otherwise

1209
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:45,950
just didn't work I never had that

1210
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,630
problem and I try to push the off let

1211
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,190
that sleep button and it wouldn't do it

1212
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,990
and then like two minutes later it would

1213
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,640
go to sleep and then come up again I've

1214
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,620
had that I've had that one yeah it was

1215
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,540
only after I started and then I started

1216
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,680
thinking it was like how sick would it

1217
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,540
be I mean this is gonna be really

1218
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,480
concerned if they did on purpose if

1219
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:05,030
there's a team yeah at Google that of

1220
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,400
saw 15 Apple I mean excuse me at Apple

1221
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:09,770
that are in charge of writing code to

1222
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,590
bug your phone like that would be I mean

1223
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:14,180
I honestly make you sick honestly I

1224
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:15,290
would not even if I heard that now be

1225
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,150
like man that's messed up but like

1226
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:21,500
they've already been doing it

1227
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:22,880
in my head like I know like I mean until

1228
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,740
there's a better I don't think they have

1229
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,799
teams that do that in my opinion I don't

1230
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,950
think either horrible press really like

1231
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:31,160
right but I mean there are some

1232
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:33,049
conspiracy

1233
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,260
obviously never gonna get caught what I

1234
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:38,539
will secret but I will say that that

1235
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:40,970
they are aware yeah of what that would

1236
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:43,430
do and maybe there are some problems

1237
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:46,329
that all I know is that when Steve Jobs

1238
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:48,559
was around my phone was amazing

1239
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:51,230
everything was great about it I would

1240
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:53,930
say I I would agree with that after he

1241
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:56,059
was a lot better it just Tim I don't

1242
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:58,460
know if Tim Cook is right you know yeah

1243
00:46:56,059 --> 00:47:02,089
he wasn't the visionary he was I don't

1244
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:03,589
know I mean I I just know my own

1245
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:05,150
personal experiences yeah I don't know

1246
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:07,970
like that Ike Ike for all I know I could

1247
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:10,069
be talking about of my whole maybe necks

1248
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:12,349
on Holly uh maybe the next upgrades we

1249
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:14,270
have to switch to Android together to

1250
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:15,529
experience it maybe but that's that's

1251
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,690
the thing I would have to convince all

1252
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:19,910
of you guys and my phones I do it unless

1253
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:22,549
like me give me like two or three years

1254
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:24,740
on this let's watch yeah and then you

1255
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:26,779
like your watch right I love it until

1256
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,160
they release the next one yeah this is

1257
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:29,750
the most brand-new one and I was like

1258
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:34,099
okay this has about maybe two years

1259
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:37,160
right which is sad conspiracy wait so

1260
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:39,470
like okay like would you guys want to

1261
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,180
keep the same exact phone for how long

1262
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:44,210
like until you get tired of it and you

1263
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:45,500
want to improve generally because you're

1264
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,260
not because you're forced but alright

1265
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,240
your own preference I think when it

1266
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,529
would naturally break down or in turn

1267
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,270
there's features where I feel like holy

1268
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:56,029
crap that's so awesome I'm gonna upgrade

1269
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:58,309
yeah saying normally the the phone one

1270
00:47:56,029 --> 00:48:00,230
phone away is not big enough maybe like

1271
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,819
two three phones away is a holy crap I

1272
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,859
need to get anything like use for

1273
00:48:01,819 --> 00:48:05,660
universe I would say how about three to

1274
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:07,579
three to five three or five because like

1275
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,410
the phone should still work and I know

1276
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:12,500
they used to work that long before yeah

1277
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:13,910
why all of a sudden after like see this

1278
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,529
is all I know it's not the phone when I

1279
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:18,380
got my last phone like I said I got it

1280
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:19,640
late I think it was the five I got the

1281
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,079
five really late and they were just had

1282
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,029
released the six like two months later

1283
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:24,890
that's what my phone start getting super

1284
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:26,119
buggy a brand new phone and you know

1285
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:28,220
it's not the phone honest it's just that

1286
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,020
one and it's unfortunate it worked

1287
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,829
perfectly right when that other one came

1288
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,029
out

1289
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:34,459
I don't remember if I updated right away

1290
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:36,679
or not I probably I probably updated it

1291
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:39,650
I probably just did it

1292
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:41,660
it got so bad everything was like what

1293
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,729
will is talking about I think it was the

1294
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:46,699
five going to the six it also be the six

1295
00:48:43,729 --> 00:48:48,170
going to the seven but regardless I was

1296
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:49,519
like okay well I know for a fact because

1297
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,569
I used to think okay maybe the phones

1298
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,539
just kind of you know maybe they

1299
00:48:50,569 --> 00:48:56,059
overheat over like a year and then I

1300
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:57,589
kind of break down but that wasn't the

1301
00:48:56,059 --> 00:49:01,279
case I was a brand if it was a brand new

1302
00:48:57,589 --> 00:49:02,059
two months in brand new phone same with

1303
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:03,589
what they were talking about with the

1304
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:04,880
battery life did you hear that someone

1305
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:06,049
tried to sue them so now they have to

1306
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,349
like if your phone dies in the first

1307
00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:13,309
like one of my my cousin actually had to

1308
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:14,929
do this her phone basically you in like

1309
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:16,309
a couple hours we'll go from a hundred

1310
00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:17,989
percent to like 20 percent brand-new

1311
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:20,839
it's like the new I fo she's got a bad

1312
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:22,880
battery yeah so so now they're because

1313
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:24,619
they're getting sued not you can go to

1314
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,089
any Apple store and tell them matter

1315
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:27,890
yeah yeah you can get a free chain but

1316
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:29,150
like no one had know one thing you got

1317
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:31,130
to do it before the end of this

1318
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,949
something something like that but I

1319
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:36,499
think if had no one tried to sue them do

1320
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:37,880
you think they would offer that probably

1321
00:49:36,499 --> 00:49:40,130
not of course not because they don't

1322
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,420
care about like oh because it wasn't a

1323
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,859
big deal to them because no one really

1324
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,089
don't know I'm late as much yeah because

1325
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:45,709
people thought like oh maybe it's just

1326
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:47,479
like I'm using it and my phone's getting

1327
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:49,999
old that's what I used to say but then I

1328
00:49:47,479 --> 00:49:51,769
realized that's not that's not how the

1329
00:49:49,999 --> 00:49:52,549
phones they don't they don't die that

1330
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:54,979
fast right

1331
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:56,809
only when the next ones coming up yeah

1332
00:49:54,979 --> 00:49:58,249
and that's only for one reason to make

1333
00:49:56,809 --> 00:50:00,559
more money to make you buy it the next

1334
00:49:58,249 --> 00:50:00,949
thing and that's why I think is messed

1335
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,479
up

1336
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:03,920
I think there's more than just that I

1337
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:06,019
think it's more than just money I think

1338
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,029
it's about influence it's about power

1339
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:09,949
it's like if this if Apple didn't have

1340
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:11,630
power it wasn't one of its power yes I

1341
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:13,849
formed them so the way that I see it is

1342
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,949
if if it wasn't Apple yeah it's gonna be

1343
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:18,380
someone else and don't watch that what

1344
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:21,199
it does what is the leader in in phones

1345
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:22,880
in soft wind phone technology right so

1346
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:25,130
it's if it's gonna be so I want someone

1347
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,479
else to do that then I want someone to

1348
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,549
have more influence because everybody

1349
00:50:26,479 --> 00:50:30,410
needs a competitor yeah or else things

1350
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:33,049
become for me kind of a monopoly yeah

1351
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:36,199
absolutely and for me it's like you know

1352
00:50:33,049 --> 00:50:40,020
who would I want to be bigger as a hi

1353
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:43,530
murder I know I keep talking about food

1354
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:47,190
Ferb's love looks like I don't mind that

1355
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:50,070
in and out yeah is massive okay I

1356
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:52,830
wouldn't mind actually if they took over

1357
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:54,510
the world because I just like me into no

1358
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:55,860
no but what if like when I want them to

1359
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,870
take over there's a difference what if

1360
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:00,900
they do take over the hamburger industry

1361
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:02,820
yeah and I would be fine because much no

1362
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,910
but they have a high standard say they

1363
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,950
double a triple their prices yeah you

1364
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,660
would still support them no no no no of

1365
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,220
course not exactly it's the same thing

1366
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,230
but I know that they have higher

1367
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,240
standard of hamburgers than like they do

1368
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,740
when like a McDonald's sure but let's

1369
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,020
say McDonald's kept their prices do you

1370
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:22,710
think they'd be able to take back in and

1371
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:27,270
out if in and out is Apple in my eyes

1372
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:29,550
McDonald's is Android yeah okay no okay

1373
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:33,240
well let's say for example right yeah I

1374
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:34,650
think so for me in and out just uses

1375
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,170
higher quality you're just doing an

1376
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:39,420
analogy yeah it's just okay so just as

1377
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:41,070
in the example yeah what I'm saying is

1378
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,480
if they were a trip with their prices

1379
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,650
because they can cuz they know how good

1380
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,550
they are and let's say they're doing

1381
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:46,800
better than McDonald's

1382
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:49,770
yes significantly so they have such a

1383
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,020
huge fan base Apple right and they

1384
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:53,520
tripled their prices mm-hmm right or

1385
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,840
they kept raising it more and more and

1386
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,940
more how what is that what Apple's doing

1387
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,230
though that in a way they are because

1388
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,370
they are making you buy and you they're

1389
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:02,490
increasing the revenue they're becoming

1390
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:04,770
more powerful sure right so at what

1391
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,660
point do all these in and out fancy you

1392
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:09,390
know what this is a great product but

1393
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,340
screw these guys are greedy hmm you know

1394
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:13,560
OB is in a big new hamburgers they're

1395
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,940
all great I you got a stay there cuz

1396
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,470
they're so good but at what point is

1397
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,240
maybe they need depending - I need

1398
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,920
another company another competitor came

1399
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,150
around and they're almost as good bond

1400
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,860
there's something yeah one-third the

1401
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:24,510
price that's great why wouldn't you

1402
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,470
support all of course but that doesn't

1403
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:30,140
that's just right now that's what I'm

1404
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:30,140
saying we need that in a no is not Apple

1405
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:36,450
no in and out if you are looking in and

1406
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,970
out yeah they have kept the same thing

1407
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,380
because they know it's good you know

1408
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:42,180
what I mean it's high quality they have

1409
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,900
their own farms but they have the cows

1410
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:48,120
they haven't like tried to like get you

1411
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,410
to pay for a little little bit more and

1412
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,850
they can keep increase enterprise you

1413
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,840
know I mean like stereotypically in and

1414
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:54,570
out right you got a picture

1415
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:56,880
in your head as a person as a compliment

1416
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:58,470
I would think it's like some old farmer

1417
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,390
guy who's just like wah just been making

1418
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:02,040
the same thing for a hundred years I'm

1419
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:03,990
not gonna change it and I'm gonna charge

1420
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,640
you a dollar you know what David was

1421
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:07,770
just using that as his analogy because

1422
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:18,780
he loves it yes yeah yeah and that's

1423
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:21,660
great no and I love McDonald's for their

1424
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,400
own reasons yeah but I just know that as

1425
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,290
far as the ingredients I think I was

1426
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,260
talking more ingredients

1427
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:30,750
yeah quality quality of ingredients with

1428
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,530
McDonald's versus in and out is a world

1429
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,930
of a difference

1430
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:37,350
sure less processed you know that type

1431
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:39,510
of thing yeah in terms like the yeah

1432
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:41,460
like the raising of the prices and you

1433
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:43,440
know having people like the money part

1434
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,910
I'm not the money part see there that's

1435
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,790
the difference because there's so many

1436
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:49,830
burger places back in the box whatever

1437
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:51,480
Burger King that they can't afford to do

1438
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,860
that the reason why Apple cans because

1439
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,060
they have such a stranglehold the weight

1440
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,260
the reason why YouTube can do what they

1441
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:57,240
do is because they have a stranglehold

1442
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,680
on the market and that's the difference

1443
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,230
and that's why I say there needs to be

1444
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,970
competition bar is low to fur to create

1445
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:06,390
a hamburger joint versus a phone company

1446
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:08,160
well it's yeah it's yeah there's not

1447
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:10,140
many competitors yeah that's why I was

1448
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,610
so excited for like that modular phone

1449
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:14,430
because if you think of like all the

1450
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:16,140
people who are upset like I don't want

1451
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:18,210
to buy a new phone every year it's like

1452
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:21,150
yeah that is kind of a solution yeah

1453
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:21,750
here's like a base processor or a phone

1454
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,670
right

1455
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:25,820
you just have to upgrade the parts right

1456
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:28,920
so it is essentially kind of a solution

1457
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:30,360
to that that bubble or whatever in the

1458
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,710
market of people who don't want to do

1459
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,880
that but I think the only thing about

1460
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:37,470
the modular phone is like you know what

1461
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,210
what can you upgrade in that I don't

1462
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:41,040
know I looking at it I just thought it

1463
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:43,230
was like a very cool exciting would yeah

1464
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,380
that's a cool idea but it's I like to

1465
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:48,150
execute that because like if your phone

1466
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,100
comes let's just say they come to the

1467
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,420
screen yeah right and then you have you

1468
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:55,050
can upgrade every other piece but the

1469
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:56,520
screen right then it's kind of like now

1470
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,930
I need to get a new screen again well

1471
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,060
maybe that's why I think Google stopped

1472
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:02,010
the project or maybe they maybe they

1473
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,640
reached a dead end and said like it's

1474
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,710
not really feasible right now right

1475
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,600
something like the idea is great yeah

1476
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:09,700
concept itself like having something

1477
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,950
that on the market that's an alternative

1478
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,050
you know it's like yeah like an

1479
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:16,270
attachment yeah and something like that

1480
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:19,120
would be very new and very exciting

1481
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:21,070
almost like a invent reinventing the

1482
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:28,510
smartphone and I do remember you're

1483
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:31,210
right about that phone and like I Oh

1484
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:32,920
still it's like politics right zette as

1485
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,490
I get over this even when it's proven

1486
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,440
yeah

1487
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:37,900
I'm under the spell me too it's not even

1488
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,060
a spell I'm committed because everyone

1489
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:44,320
else is you know does that make sense

1490
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:47,200
I literally have yeah it's a good

1491
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:49,600
product until they update until a new

1492
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,510
phone comes on yeah yeah I agree it's

1493
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,310
like when you first get it and it's new

1494
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:56,410
even with bugs it's like holy crap the

1495
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:58,720
fact that this is a real thing that

1496
00:55:56,410 --> 00:56:01,930
didn't exist ten years ago ten years ago

1497
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,850
yeah the iPhone yeah okay well whatever

1498
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:06,370
year you know that I won't even exist at

1499
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:08,410
one point yeah and how far it's gone is

1500
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:08,680
like this is an amazing about 14 years I

1501
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,540
think

1502
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,550
yeah it's regardless even in the first

1503
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:15,760
iPhone compared to now it's amazing it's

1504
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:18,190
a great brilliant product and maybe they

1505
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,960
needed all that all our money to make it

1506
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:21,730
to get it that far get it to that point

1507
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,260
yeah maybe maybe maybe that's the only

1508
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:24,820
way they're surviving but I highly

1509
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,310
highly doubt that I think they're making

1510
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,170
so much money yeah I don't think that's

1511
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:32,710
the problem to create a company like

1512
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:34,660
that it's a a lot of work and it's it is

1513
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:36,790
money to company you know like each

1514
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,350
engineer you know they have like I don't

1515
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:40,000
even how many staff they have probably

1516
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:43,810
like hundreds of thousands I'm guessing

1517
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,690
obably yeah like one engineer in for AR

1518
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:48,790
yeah it cost like 300 grand a year

1519
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:51,250
yeah right that's like not even

1520
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:52,630
including like health insurance right so

1521
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,600
let's say four hundred thousand a year

1522
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:56,350
yeah for one person what if they but

1523
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,330
think about it like this

1524
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:01,360
they're they have that many they have to

1525
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:03,010
pay a lot obviously alright but it

1526
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,480
that's not the issue like they they're

1527
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:06,070
making money they're making like they

1528
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,990
make a ton of my guy at the top is made

1529
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:09,700
Oney the people at Hilltop they all make

1530
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:11,710
a lot exactly like a ridiculous amount

1531
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:13,510
yeah so it's not the issue that they're

1532
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,890
like they need to do this to to stay

1533
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:16,430
competitive like they're doing it

1534
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,230
because it makes it makes

1535
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:20,210
and money yeah you know it's not about

1536
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:22,640
like because they're not making money

1537
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:24,500
they're dying no they can be making

1538
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:29,600
money but there's a difference between

1539
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:31,340
making money and being greedy that's it

1540
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,320
that's another conversation there's some

1541
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,880
philosophy in there a lot of philosophy

1542
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:39,350
in that one you know what else is greedy

1543
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:44,300
when you agreed he agreed with me oh oh

1544
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:46,190
because the word greed let me bring it

1545
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,720
back to the beginning point yes I said

1546
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:50,270
that because I do you knew we were gonna

1547
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:54,010
be DejaVu I'm starting to feel tingly of

1548
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:57,200
greed holy crap ASMR seat time in space

1549
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:59,540
I'm time in space all this whole podcast

1550
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,970
there's no order everything's happening

1551
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,780
at the same time did you have the very

1552
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,090
first iPhone

1553
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:07,550
I don't think Levi did I think I only

1554
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:09,410
got like the second third I was on I

1555
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:14,690
came in at before I think I was really

1556
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:16,370
late I was a blackberry guy or awesome

1557
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:19,280
dude you like the buttons you could text

1558
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:20,450
without looking yeah I like those and

1559
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,800
you know else you could do is play that

1560
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:23,300
little ball game where you bounce it off

1561
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,520
the walls and break all the things pong

1562
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,950
pong no you break like the block brick

1563
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,440
breaker yeah that see you don't even

1564
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:32,360
know dude Rick Baker was you know kids

1565
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,040
don't even know did you why does an

1566
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,500
iPhone have to it's like a simple game

1567
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:39,770
yeah they probably do they're starting

1568
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,030
to get into the you know software so

1569
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:43,760
they're gonna have a bunch of guys

1570
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:46,730
remember um the little block dude you

1571
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,350
know your ti-83 Spidey use your

1572
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:50,870
calculators had that that block dude

1573
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:53,060
game oh like and you would like have to

1574
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:54,500
like solve puzzles you remember that I

1575
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,630
don't remember that I never had a TI you

1576
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:00,380
never had ti a tattoo or didn't get into

1577
00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:01,700
calculus so I think I don't need it for

1578
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,610
account you need it for geometry I only

1579
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:06,740
got up to Algebra one that's a lie such

1580
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:08,510
a lie hey you know if there's people out

1581
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,110
there who've got only into algebra one

1582
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:11,150
it's okay

1583
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:13,610
it is okay Einstein didn't even get to

1584
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:15,110
anything he's a nobody he got somewhere

1585
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:15,740
he didn't even know what gravity was

1586
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,930
loser

1587
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:20,900

weird

1602
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:55,270

00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:56,950
that you know I mean do you know I mean

1604
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:59,260
cuz that's kind of the route you know

1605
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:01,390
what you know before you could be like

1606
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:05,380
oh and not that I'm saying this but back

1607
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:07,360
in the day they power like try think of

1608
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:09,010
a good example like being gay was so

1609
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,080
wrong and now if you were to say oh

1610
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:13,750
that's weird you would get so much flak

1611
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,220
for it yeah I mean but then I yeah so

1612
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,320
what if in the future it's like dude

1613
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:19,870
they love is love dude like if you want

1614
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:21,820
to love your sister and cousin like how

1615
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:23,200
dare you say it's weird you know what at

1616
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,970
what point does it stop because it might

1617
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,550
not it won't I don't think it will

1618
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:30,100
what you don't think about what I think

1619
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:31,810
it's okay I think it's okay if a guy

1620
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:34,510
loves your sister I think so too

1621
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:36,370
I don't know except yeah I don't think

1622
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:38,350
it's acceptable it's not except on and

1623
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:40,090
there's also health reasons for that I

1624
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:41,740
think if you have kids I don't like it

1625
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:42,850
there you know but there's also health

1626
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:44,260
reasons for a lot of things I don't

1627
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:46,690
think so either but I'm just saying it

1628
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:48,190
might we don't know it nobody thought it

1629
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:49,300
was gonna be at a time when everybody

1630
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:51,480
was like you know what there shouldn't

1631
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:55,690
be any laws against it if people want to

1632
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:57,400
yeah but like at what point is it but

1633
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:59,980
how is that dangerous to society or in

1634
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,780
menace I don't know I don't get the kid

1635
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,880
maybe there's more complications I guess

1636
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:05,530
you don't think just because people want

1637
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,570
to do it there shouldn't be laws against

1638
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:09,970
it no with with it with your system

1639
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:14,170
siblings siblings sibling love so in

1640
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:15,070
assessed instances illegal yeah it is

1641
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,990
right mm-hmm

1642
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:18,070
it's just it's not just like that's

1643
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:20,020
weird and gross

1644
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:23,710
I don't it's legal should it be illegal

1645
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:24,640
or I think it shouldn't be illegal as

1646
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:27,670
long as you don't have kids because

1647
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:29,800
there's complications there if we're

1648
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:32,890
getting into politics about it oh you

1649
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,910
always fall takes me out yeah but do you

1650
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:35,790
know what I'm saying though right like

1651
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:38,020
at what point the freedom does it stop

1652
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:39,880
if you want to if you want to marry your

1653
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,020
cow you should be able to seed so that

1654
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,490
so there's our you miss there too but

1655
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:44,910
like I think it's cute your

1656
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:47,710
you're late I get to that point where

1657
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:49,660
who's to determine what love is

1658
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:51,310
no but I'm but that's what we're art

1659
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:53,380
that's what we're saying yeah so I'm I'm

1660
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:59,110
saying it's okay okay so you're already

1661
01:01:53,380 --> 01:02:01,060
at that point I'm already there yeah we

1662
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:03,100
got legal paper so you think you're

1663
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:05,020
you're taking like a libertarian side

1664
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:07,480
where the government should not regulate

1665
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:09,670
personal right like love interest or

1666
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,010
like laws know what love we're already

1667
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:14,230
we already have that but but the

1668
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:16,750
argument there is that people when you

1669
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:18,610
get married there's benefits oh you're

1670
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,810
talking about the benefits part no but

1671
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,640
no but I that's what I'm saying that's

1672
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:23,500
why you should or that's the argument

1673
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,600
for like why people don't want to allow

1674
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:29,050
gay marriage or you know if gay if gay

1675
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:31,630
transsexual lesbian whatever else yes

1676
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:35,470
I'm missing if any of those people can

1677
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:37,600
benefit from from these laws because

1678
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:39,490
because what defines that is love their

1679
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:42,220
definition of love Yeah right right

1680
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:44,290
so if love is what it is if I love my

1681
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:46,119
dog but it's also consider them it's not

1682
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:48,820
considered maybe not my dog if I have a

1683
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:51,580
like brother or sister whatever right if

1684
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:54,550
that if that relationship is based off

1685
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:56,440
of old quote unquote love right yeah but

1686
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:58,630
how same exact it's different with a dog

1687
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,880
because a dog can't reciprocate okay so

1688
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:03,670
your sister like incest yeah like yeah

1689
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:07,060
your sister yeah that I get that

1690
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:08,650
perspective I just haven't thought about

1691
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:10,060
that much I don't think about it either

1692
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:11,350
I don't want to know but I know what

1693
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:15,520
you're saying disgusts me to think about

1694
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:17,170
it I know but so we're allowed to see

1695
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,330
that right now if they see this in like

1696
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:20,710
20 years when it's allowed maybe what

1697
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:22,720
I'm saying yeah I mean we're gonna be

1698
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:24,940
we're bigots know so what I'm saying it

1699
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,890
disgusts me personally yeah but other

1700
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:28,930
people that's what I'm saying but back

1701
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:30,460
then 20 years ago it was disgusting

1702
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:33,190
people to be gay like I don't want to

1703
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:35,859

1704
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:37,150

1706
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:40,600
yeah and that's okay I don't judge if to

1707
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,280
the other guys wanna do it that's fine

1708
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,050
your think what I'm saying you're not

1709
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,670
even allowed to say that anymore so you

1710
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:45,910
what what I just said yeah I just said

1711
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:47,740
it

1712
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:50,080

not allowed to say that you were oh no

1715
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:54,790
what I don't even like it when two

1716
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:55,440
couples we're allowed to kiss in front

1717
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:57,720
of me I don't

1718
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,780
like that right now I know sure well

1719
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:02,130
we're we're allowed to say right now

1720
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:04,530
here what we're pushing down a slippery

1721
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:06,240
slope no but I'm saying this is that's I

1722
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:08,220
it's interesting someone it is it is

1723
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,980
we're allowed right not to say oh my

1724
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:12,840

disgusting I think it's disgusting I

1728
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,650
think it's fine to say that because I

1729
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:21,900
feel that I know but I'm just saying why

1730
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:24,590
myself doing that my soul but I'm just

1731
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:28,290
saying we're allowed socially to say it

1732
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:29,850
yeah yes we are we are you say like oh

1733
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:32,040

mom was dating her 30-something your own

1735
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:36,810
son okay that's disgusting I know but

1736
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:38,760
you can't you can say that yeah if you

1737
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:40,800
see two people who write no matter what

1738
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,930
you believe I yeah I think anyone should

1739
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:45,150
be able to say anything they want yeah

1740
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:46,890
as long as it doesn't incite I know but

1741
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:51,390
I'm like paying a Wiley point or you're

1742
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:53,550
like you know I don't know I just

1743
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:57,110
he said no offence and he was talking

1744
01:04:53,550 --> 01:05:01,170
about people who are in like who are in

1745
01:04:57,110 --> 01:05:03,690
no no offense no that's what I'm saying

1746
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:05,220
it's my free speech yeah but as far as

1747
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:06,930
what other people do in their lives it's

1748
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:09,090
none of my business I agree with that

1749
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:11,250
there's a wall right there but I agree

1750
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:12,660
with between me and that same like like

1751
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:15,450
a sister something like you know like

1752
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:17,880
that's off limits right first like I'll

1753
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:20,970
take it to the crazy extreme for for

1754
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:23,310
human beings that have sexual relations

1755
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:25,260
with animals which does exist yeah like

1756
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,880
you know bestiality I don't watch that

1757
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,740
stuff never even actually even seen one

1758
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,040
sure but I know it exists right because

1759
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:36,360
people told me yeah and it's illegal Who

1760
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:38,070
am I to say though that like what that

1761
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:41,310
person does and feels what if they

1762
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:43,080
really feel in love like maybe there's

1763
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:45,780
psychologically a little bit strange

1764
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:48,090
from my perspective but if they are

1765
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:50,910
actually super in love sexually with a

1766
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:51,570
monkey and the monkey maybe feels the

1767
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:53,220
same way

1768
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:56,330
honey that's the thing how do you how do

1769
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:58,410
you know that the monkey could that's

1770
01:05:56,330 --> 01:06:01,470
okay fine let's let's take you

1771
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:04,680
brother-sister relationship yeah brother

1772
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:06,870
and sister sexuality and love and

1773
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,640
romantic and I would never do that

1774
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:11,130
let me put that out there and no offense

1775
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:13,380
no offense anyone like for voice no but

1776
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:15,150
it is offensive to them but it's in

1777
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:17,700
society it's not offense okay because we

1778
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:19,950
all agree that it's disgusting right but

1779
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,990
there are until that there are people

1780
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:24,600
who are okay with that there's very

1781
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:27,390
there's less and I'm sure they do exist

1782
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:29,730
but what I'm saying all this up is like

1783
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:31,200
what where do we draw the line because

1784
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:34,050
we used to draw the lines in different

1785
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:37,080
places so right now this same podcast

1786
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:38,520
video in let not even maybe like 20

1787
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,480
years yeah that's not a lot of time

1788
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,570
we'll still be alive

1789
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:45,630
30 years even at what point does this PC

1790
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:46,650
culture make it not okay to say what we

1791
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:50,360
just said that we're gonna be a

1792
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:53,010
considered yeah like just incest phobic

1793
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:54,330
we're bringing incest what you're an SS

1794
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:56,610
phone it sounds like something that's

1795
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:57,780
yeah like it's like yeah of course we

1796
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:59,850
could say that now but you're saying in

1797
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:02,430
10 years because before they thought

1798
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:03,840
being gay was wrong they did yeah they

1799
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:05,130
thought it would like every majority of

1800
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,300
people thought it was wrong they felt

1801
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,700
that even gay people vote they had to

1802
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:10,860
hide it yeah yeah so that's all I'm

1803
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,570
saying is to like let's say 40 50 years

1804
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,160
ago or same thing as being black they

1805
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,900
thought it was wrong to have that skin

1806
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,450
color to be Asian or whatever at some

1807
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,620
point yeah so as much as we believe

1808
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:22,470
something right now that incest is

1809
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:26,100
disgusting it is is a very part there's

1810
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:28,410
a possibility right yeah in in 20 30 40

1811
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,450
100 years I'm gonna get we're gonna I'm

1812
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:32,190
gonna be in trouble for having said what

1813
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:33,960
I said or everyone in this generation

1814
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:35,490
like wow they were so close-minded right

1815
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,890
yeah exactly but that's what I'm saying

1816
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:39,930
that was it stop so I'm progressing I'm

1817
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:42,960
like fast forwarding to 20 years later

1818
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:45,270
and saying right it's I know you do your

1819
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,680
thing I know you are I don't want to

1820
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:48,330
participate in it but you do your thing

1821
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,940
yeah but not for the animals that's

1822
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:52,140
different unless you can get animal

1823
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:54,540
intelligence level I'm just taking that

1824
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:55,980
the animal thing that's different but

1825
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:57,780
I'm talking about human human

1826
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,940
interaction yeah okay but here's the

1827
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:02,010
other argument yeah what about a 17 year

1828
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:04,170
old kid or like a 15 year old and an

1829
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:07,290
adult or a 12 year old and an adult who

1830
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:08,610
consents the government what if at some

1831
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:11,010
point yeah it does but what if at some

1832
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:12,990
point it becomes it becomes that where

1833
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:14,100
it's like okay well who decides how old

1834
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:18,930
you are when you can make choices

1835
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:20,510
conscious choices man it could you never

1836
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:21,800
know it could it could become that

1837
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:23,300
when you could didn't well you know

1838
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,040
because we can say I think pedophiles

1839
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,750
are disgusting I don't know what age

1840
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,540
yeah you know because some people you

1841
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:31,310
can consent when you're 17 years old

1842
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:33,350
that's the 18 right you have to be right

1843
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:35,390
to be allowed to get married or okay

1844
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:37,280
well let's say 16 to get love or to be

1845
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:38,810
macked you would know like you remember

1846
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,460
you as a kid maybe you only the smartest

1847
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,840
thing but like you could also say that

1848
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:43,280
about your 20 year old self or your 30

1849
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,020
year old self like maybe your 40 year

1850
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,250
old self would be like my 30 year old

1851
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,880
self should have never gotten married he

1852
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,680
didn't know better

1853
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,060
yeah should we make it illegal for him

1854
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,010
to get thirty year olds and under you

1855
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:53,570
get married marriage is a different

1856
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:55,490
thing from what I mean that's just my

1857
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:58,190
best my want that you know what I'm

1858
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:59,930
saying yeah yeah I think no but where do

1859
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:02,480
you where do you stand where do you guys

1860
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:05,690
stand somewhere right I follow the law

1861
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:08,030
yeah but like I think people pedophiles

1862
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:09,290
and some like that like I I think it's

1863
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:13,010
right for it I don't think it I don't

1864
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:15,170
think it's right to that someone up that

1865
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:16,760
age gap so what is that age gap for you

1866
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:18,440
I mean it's whatever to me it's been

1867
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,360
defined by what's the law what the last

1868
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,160
legal yeah I agree I'm in the same boat

1869
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,630
too right that's the only reason why

1870
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,520
though yeah but if you really think

1871
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:28,190
about and break it down it's like it's

1872
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,290
already weird if like say one one is 18

1873
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:33,200
which is legal and the other one's 50 I

1874
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:34,820
think that's weird I think it's like

1875
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,530
we're offending we could offend people

1876
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:38,210
most people society agrees that's

1877
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:42,500
probably weird but then you're also like

1878
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:45,230
a 8 Age Discrimination NIST yeah because

1879
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:47,390
back in the day I'm pretty sure like

1880
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:49,280
back like you know yeah maybe like

1881
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:50,060
during Genghis Khan era or something

1882
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:52,040
right mm-hmm

1883
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:54,590
even further back I'm sure there were

1884
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:57,160
marriages that looked like that yeah I

1885
01:09:54,590 --> 01:10:00,080
don't know if the word pedophilia really

1886
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:01,580
do you think it existed I guess the

1887
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,840
whole there the cultural thing maybe it

1888
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:04,910
was more of it religiously there was a

1889
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,920
set up right like you know what do you

1890
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:08,630
call arranged marriages at certain point

1891
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:11,840
maybe the parents thought okay my child

1892
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:16,100
here my son or daughter is at the age

1893
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:18,230
that I believe who that that can be and

1894
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:19,790
should be married well yeah I mean if

1895
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:21,380
you're talking about a long time ago you

1896
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:23,690
probably would get married and start

1897
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:26,330
being an adult as soon as it's like 13

1898
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:28,250
yeah soon as you get your period when

1899
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:30,020
they're fertile pedophilia and stuff

1900
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,000
like that it's probably I would assume

1901
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:33,280
more of a modern term that describes

1902
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,950
like predators

1903
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:38,470
right like modern society like the

1904
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:41,080
Predators who are into this thing behind

1905
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:42,880
closed doors and they they try to right

1906
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:45,760
right all right as a as opposed to

1907
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,140
having like an arranged yeah which is

1908
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,490
which was coming through culture a

1909
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:50,020
little bit something like that sense so

1910
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:52,270
what I'm saying and the whole reason why

1911
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:54,670
I brought it up is like it's not crazy

1912
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:56,500
yeah isn't it crazy to think and this

1913
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:58,900
goes back to like facts right right like

1914
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,620
as we know for a fact right now that's

1915
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:03,400
gross

1916
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:04,870
to me I mean I think so but we're doing

1917
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:08,890
it on camera and this will live forever

1918
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:14,440
we know that it's disgusting right now

1919
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:15,850
to people what oh yeah but like I'm just

1920
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:19,720
saying isn't it crazy to think that one

1921
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:21,640
day it might not be to be yes exactly

1922
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:23,230
that's what I that's what I think you

1923
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,850
think it won't that is so crazy

1924
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:26,080
most people I would say most people even

1925
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:28,180
people listening probably queer crazy

1926
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,550
but like it's true if you really think

1927
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:32,320
about it yeah that many years ago people

1928
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:33,880
thought it was crazy that black people

1929
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,160
are on the same level as everyone else

1930
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:39,340
even Asian that's true yeah same thing

1931
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:42,070
with especially gay people yeah it was

1932
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:44,050
illegal and now it's legal yeah so go

1933
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:46,480
back like a 100 I don't know hundred on

1934
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:47,760
my history but how many years and tell

1935
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,970
them there's gonna be a black president

1936
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:53,560
this this slave ancestor is gonna be in

1937
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,670
charge of all you guys mm-hmm I

1938
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,380
guarantee nobody would believe that

1939
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:59,380
nobody be like that's disgusting

1940
01:11:56,380 --> 01:12:01,030
yeah but what if what if in the future

1941
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:02,950
we're saying then that pedophile

1942
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:05,710
disgusting you're sick you deserve to be

1943
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:07,150
shot comes normal and then right yeah

1944
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:09,040
this is scary I see what you're saying

1945
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:10,750
yeah it's crazy to think that that could

1946
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,550
happen it's not impossible it's not it

1947
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:14,590
cost nothing is impossible because it's

1948
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:17,550
happened yeah it was started off with

1949
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:19,540
gays like being okay like being you know

1950
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:21,190
homophobia was a big deal it was like

1951
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:22,840
wrong to be homophobic like it was it

1952
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:24,520
wasn't and then it slowly we saw the

1953
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,860
change grow yeah I don't know about you

1954
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:29,950
but for me and oh yeah yeah like you

1955
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:32,350
could say the FA G you could say that

1956
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:34,480
yeah because I even said in a video back

1957
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:36,370
then and nobody blinked about it

1958
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,710
actually when I even said that word it

1959
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:41,110
doesn't bother junior high yeah like it

1960
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:43,570
wasn't it bad it wasn't it wasn't I'd

1961
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:45,400
even tie that with like me neither

1962
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:49,540
I just said because it was like this

1963
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:50,950
person came and then I stopped saying

1964
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:53,290
exactly yeah because we're finding the

1965
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:55,630
rules yeah society right Society yeah

1966
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:57,940
but like even even now like just seeing

1967
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:59,230
the progression of like I guess the most

1968
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:02,170
recent one in our lifetime our

1969
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:04,360
generation is the LGBT like thing but it

1970
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:07,150
wasn't a beauty it was just gay and

1971
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:08,740
lesbians yes and then after that and

1972
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:11,110
when that start movements aren't

1973
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:12,610
happening then transgenders and that's

1974
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:15,040
happening right now all right I think in

1975
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:17,320
I'm talking like law large face yes it's

1976
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,760
becoming a very normal and modern thing

1977
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,570
and then there's people fighting back

1978
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,490
there's always gonna be people

1979
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:22,960
especially because it doesn't go with

1980
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:25,000
like if we would they believe that's why

1981
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,550
I'm saying so at what point does it

1982
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,170
become not that trying so not time let

1983
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:30,880
me just say I'm not tying this like I'm

1984
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:33,790
not saying a pedophile is a gate like a

1985
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:37,120
gay person yeah yeah yeah your types of

1986
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:40,060
combinations of people and yeah that we

1987
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:42,670
looked at as being wrong and disgusting

1988
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:44,080
yeah and I just thought it was it was

1989
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:45,910
just a weird thought that's why alcohol

1990
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,670
that's why for me when you asked me the

1991
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:50,470
incest rule thing and I was like already

1992
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:52,120
fast-forwarding twenty years later

1993
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:54,520
having seen what happened in the past

1994
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:56,710
and saying yeah it should be legal yeah

1995
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:58,390
I know I know what you're saying yeah so

1996
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:59,950
I'm just putting that hat on and yeah

1997
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:01,810
like but you know what actually not

1998
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:05,320
think about it yeah the whole animal

1999
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:06,400
thing bestiality yeah if you really

2000
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,140
really know

2001
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,490
remember digging ourselves a hole but

2002
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,530
I'm just gonna say it if you were

2003
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:13,300
already really yeah it's fine that

2004
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:15,910
rabbits do to hole yeah the rabbit hole

2005
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:19,720
basically if you really if you really

2006
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:21,760
break it down you can get to a point

2007
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,170
where people who's to say it might not

2008
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,920
get to a point where people are like

2009
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:29,830
okay this guy can consent this animal

2010
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,120
can't consent or can't consent but who's

2011
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:32,410
who's to say that we don't get to a

2012
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,750
point where you're like well that is

2013
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:37,630
animalist you're being an animal like a

2014
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:39,130
animal for that animal has the right how

2015
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:40,210
do you know I can't make decisions how

2016
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:41,380
do you know that animal doesn't are you

2017
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,090
saying it's like a like you know like

2018
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:45,250
being a feminist are you saying like oh

2019
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:46,990
this you're treating this animal is less

2020
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:48,490
than you you think humans are that much

2021
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:50,970
superior that animals can't make

2022
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:53,170
decisions I feel like there's probably a

2023
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:55,570
subculture that's already like that yeah

2024
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:57,469
yeah but what I'm saying is we that's

2025
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:59,960
it's pretty ridiculous yeah

2026
01:14:57,469 --> 01:15:02,239
but who knows it happened yeah that's

2027
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:05,660
the crazy thing and in my I mean I think

2028
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:07,010
it will I think you know what I mean the

2029
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,750
way the way we're going I don't think it

2030
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:10,520
will I think because I think it's

2031
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:13,100
there's gonna be this we're still riding

2032
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,150
this wave of like legalizing and being

2033
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,580
accepting of everything but I think

2034
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:19,160
there's gonna be a corner culture that

2035
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:21,020
be like its back to the rules of the old

2036
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:25,070
days yeah and I think it's starting to

2037
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:26,360
already happen cuz of Trump no not no

2038
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:27,860
not just because of Trump I think that's

2039
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:30,140
a that's possible I think it's just

2040
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:32,060
effect of what's happening cuz of Obama

2041
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:34,370
I've been going to extreme exactly I

2042
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,210
think I think that's what's with

2043
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:38,330
extremeness

2044
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:40,250
you know with extremeness comes

2045
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:42,860
extremeness right right there's balance

2046
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:45,380
and hopefully yeah it lands somewhere in

2047
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:47,180
the middle yeah there's always there's

2048
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:49,580
always I mean everything in life is a

2049
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:51,530
sine and cosine graph and you know like

2050
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:53,480
even in the three of us I'm sure there's

2051
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:55,190
there would be things that you know just

2052
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:56,840
even on this in this in this tiny room

2053
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:58,790
like there are things that we would

2054
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,469
disagree with and there would have to be

2055
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:02,449
that balance in the middle of what we

2056
01:16:00,469 --> 01:16:04,880
all agree to yeah but if we bring in one

2057
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:06,830
more person that balance might that that

2058
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,239
middle point might need to shift over to

2059
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:10,280
the left or right or whatever right so

2060
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:12,500
else that's just that's the president

2061
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:14,320
human condition that's the president

2062
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:16,670
president is the president

2063
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,650
that's the influential people of the

2064
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:20,570
world they shifted which way they want

2065
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:24,320
yeah the majority so that's what Apple

2066
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:26,239
is in tech yep well that got really deep

2067
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:30,620
we started talking about bestiality I

2068
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:35,210
agree definitely agree all right so that

2069
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:38,989
was a nice that was a great while we

2070
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:41,270
really went we went deep to some faraway

2071
01:16:38,989 --> 01:16:43,730
places on that one yeah but you know

2072
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:45,380
what that I know that's the kind of this

2073
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:47,270
is what I want this blog has to be its

2074
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:51,130
called off the pill we didn't none of us

2075
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:53,480
took it's not planned it's not planned I

2076
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:54,890
like it like this I know I know this

2077
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:58,250
better to have things planned but I

2078
01:16:54,890 --> 01:17:00,230
don't like planning for one sure so too

2079
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:01,370
bad and this is honestly stuff that we

2080
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:02,960
probably would have talked about in the

2081
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:05,650
kitchen we do one minutes later and you

2082
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:08,150
David sometimes yeah even though like

2083
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:09,660
it's gonna sound really weird but we'll

2084
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:11,460
be on FaceTime working

2085
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,870
like a song or something yeah and then

2086
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,250
we'll end up like looking at my phone

2087
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:15,600
it's like three hours later I was like

2088
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:17,370
what are we talked to we're not even

2089
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,200
working on the song did we talk about

2090
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:20,760
it's usually really weird things it's

2091
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:22,530
the same thing we just talked about we

2092
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,540
talked about incest all the diversity oh

2093
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:25,560
just kidding just kidding guys this is

2094
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:27,020
actually the first time we talked about

2095
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,370
this I think it is the first time yeah

2096
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:31,200
other things we talked about that we

2097
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:32,640
should probably bring up another time it

2098
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,920
always starts with what do you think

2099
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,460

2100
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,560
you think
