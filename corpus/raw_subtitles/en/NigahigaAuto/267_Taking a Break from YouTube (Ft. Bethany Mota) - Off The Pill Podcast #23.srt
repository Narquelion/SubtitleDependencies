00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,750
like a few years and really really cool

49
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:22,370
it just I felt very out of place because

50
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,040
I was suddenly thrown in with all of

51
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,360
these like legit fashion designers to

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,579

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,739
together and I did well though it did

54
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,569
really well it did better than I could

55
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:35,930
have ever expected but yeah it was

56
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:38,180
definitely like crazy that I was like 18

57
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,340
at the time 2050 that's when I met you I

58
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,209
think right in Japan we met in Japan

59
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,680
yeah I was around that time I think even

60
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,420
later no I think it was way before that

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,180
oh really I think it was like it was a

62
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,269
while ago twelve or something mm-hmm oh

63
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,209
wow yeah how old were you at the time at

64
00:02:53,269 --> 00:03:02,269
sixteen okay that would mean sense yeah

65
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:03,590
we got you to eat squid ink remember we

66
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:06,409
heard you're really picky I still

67
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,269
remember that yeah terrified I know it

68
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:08,480
wasn't that bad though you didn't like

69
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:11,870
it

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,329
it was pretty bad how did the Arab

71
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,129
hostel like think umm about him kind of

72
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:17,329
interested in how that kind of came

73
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,660
about did they just reach out to you

74
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,430
randomly or I well it started with just

75
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,840
like a casual meeting like I didn't

76
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,359
think anything was really gonna come of

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,150
it and we basically just did a few meet

78
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:30,889
and greets like in New York and they

79
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,139
were like whoa we want to work with you

80
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,209
more so I basically like picked a few

81
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:37,040
items from their existing line and like

82
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,379
put that out as like these are my top

83
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,840
picks and then those kind of all sold

84
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:44,290
out and then they decided they want to

85
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,090
do like a full on like partnership so I

86
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,699
launched the bethany mota clothing brand

87
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,299
under them and so i was in all of their

88
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:55,639
stores and online and it was really

89
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,859
successful it was just really fun also

90
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,900
to like actually design and have

91
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:02,049
something out there that everybody was

92
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,760
like could actually have and wear and

93
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:08,750
yeah it was a crazy experience

94
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,329
you're 16 I think I've never been 17 or

95
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,129
18 when that happened that's crazy

96
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:15,019
that's still pretty young good you're

97
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:17,329
working with a bunch of adults yeah

98
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:19,699
that's what's crazy too is like because

99
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,889
I'm older now I mean I'm still young but

100
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,020
it's like I'm more aware of what was

101
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:25,750
actually happening I feel like because

102
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,760
it all happened so

103
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,580
and because I got into it so young I

104
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,160
didn't really know what was going on

105
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,710
almost like not to say I didn't

106
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,640
appreciate it but kind of kind of like I

107
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:42,400
just was so unaware of like how like

108
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,930
one-of-a-kind that was because it was

109
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,550
deal that was right that was a pretty

110
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,170
big deal right especially at the time

111
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,940
for youtubers that wasn't like you

112
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,610
really one of the first to get a major

113
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,880
that's a major brand like it's a I think

114
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,650
right yeah no absolutely not no we don't

115
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,940
have that in Hawaii though I think in a

116
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,320
while but when I heard about I was like

117
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,060
oh I've heard of that before and then

118
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,350
like that's a major Brannen for

119
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,320
youtubers back then we weren't getting

120
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,260
those kind of deals now maybe yeah back

121
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,460
then it was a big deal but are you still

122
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,530
so you're not working with them anymore

123
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,500
but are you still doing you're still

124
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,810
doing fashions related things right uh

125
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,920
not like developing clothing I mean it's

126
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,990
something that I definitely want to do

127
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,850
more in the future but I think it'd just

128
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,040
be much different than it was back then

129
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,810
because I was also obviously a lot

130
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,410
younger so I think anything I put out

131
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,850
now is just gonna be like a little older

132
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,650
but I haven't been designing I've just

133
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,450
been like like I still do fashion

134
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,430
related content but just not like

135
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,140
designing clothes that's your main focus

136
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,520
to look back to making more videos

137
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,360
because you did take a look a break for

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,090
a bit right yeah I took like I feel like

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,240
I took a lot of little breaks and then I

140
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:52,870
took a pretty big break most recently

141
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,620
and I think it's just like it started

142
00:05:52,870 --> 00:06:00,130
probably end of 2014 when I was kinda

143
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:03,070
just like I am so burnt out on this

144
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,980
thing because I was going hard for years

145
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,450
and I honestly had no social life like I

146
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,160
didn't have any friends I was also

147
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,010
homeschooled when I started making

148
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,840
videos so getting into it when I first

149
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,270
started first couple years it was like

150
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,160
three videos a week Wow and no one on my

151
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,810
team so it's just me filming editing

152
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,970
everything and I didn't socialize so my

153
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,000
question is if you're a homeschooled how

154
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,590
did you like come across YouTube and

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,370
knowing that you could make videos and

156
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,480
stuff like that

157
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,070
it was actually because I was

158
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,140
home-schooled that I feel like I was

159
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,790
more aware of it because I was home all

160
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,250
the time and so it was like always

161
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,320
online and then I stumbled across it I

162
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,630
feel like actually if I was in public

163
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,669
school at the time I probably wouldn't

164
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,470
have cared as much about it and

165
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:50,260
definitely wouldn't have made videos I

166
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,510
think was just because I was just bored

167
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,210
and so I started watching them and then

168
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,730
decide to make them also being so shy

169
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,460
growing up I think if I was in public

170
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,570
school there's no way I would have even

171
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,200
started a channel but it was because I

172
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,240
felt like I was kind of like hiding in a

173
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,010
way and then this is like me being able

174
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,070
to talk to the world from like my own

175
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,740
room that's true I feel like back in the

176
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,600
day especially like I don't know if this

177
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,190
is true or not but I feel like a lot of

178
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,130
the older youtubers people who start a

179
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,720
long time ago or more like shy and

180
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,970
introverted people who fall in the space

181
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,400
to express themselves and it's kind of

182
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,520
changed to like the opposite yeah I

183
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,580
noticed that I think there back then

184
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,100
there was a lot of it was mostly I think

185
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,770
introverted right people that felt like

186
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,900
this was kind of their only outlet to

187
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,730
actually express themselves in ways that

188
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,610
they would never do in front of people

189
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,780
right and then now it's uh I mean I

190
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,410
don't want to say it but it sounds like

191
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,970
it was like like the losers the loser

192
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,530
kids who are kind of on it and it kind

193
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,360
of made it big and then now the cool

194
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,210
kids are here you know like the Logan

195
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,400
Paul is like tall buff looking

196
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,220
good-looking dudes and like you know we

197
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,750
weren't that back so we found a space

198
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,240
where we were like safe but now the cool

199
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,890
kids took over do you feel like it kind

200
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,140
of helped your person like help develop

201
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:15,160
your personality oh absolutely

202
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:17,500
like even comparing Ben to now my first

203
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,740
video I was so awkward I mean I'm still

204
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,080
awkward but back then it was so bad like

205
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,880
I was whispering in the video because I

206
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,400
didn't want anyone to hear me talk like

207
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,620
in my house and then I also was wearing

208
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,390
glasses back then because I was too

209
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,099
afraid to wear contacts so every video

210
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,410
I'd have to like take my glasses off and

211
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,790
just be like school win team just so I

212
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:40,450
could look in the viewfinder and like

213
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:42,280
see what was going on so awkward and so

214
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,900
scared but don't you think that's what

215
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,339
made you loveable though like to the

216
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,980
people who really like loved you they're

217
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,630
like oh my god I relate she saw quick I

218
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,040
think that's like why we watch people

219
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,610
like we watched certain people that we

220
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
kind of

221
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,779
yourselves in so I feel like a lot of

222
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,120
girls that were my age could relate to

223
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:00,760
so much of what was going on with me

224
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,980
back then cuz I was just really trying

225
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,579
to figure it out kind of all over the

226
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,370
place

227
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:07,510
well what's getting back to the just

228
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,640
because I brought it up earlier but

229
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,810
didn't continue about the story that you

230
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,399
were telling us about oh yeah that Dom

231
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:18,279
so you're dating d-trix it's not a

232
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,250
secret right it's very public I lived

233
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,180
with d-trix for a long time and now he's

234
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,790
actually the reason why I moved out to

235
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:29,260
LA for like a few years but uh yeah so

236
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,730
Dom Dietrich's is currently what she was

237
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,279
he on So You Think You Can Dance

238
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,050
they think you dance so he was gonna be

239
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,560
here but he will be here another time he

240
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,720
said well I don't know how that story

241
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,290
came basically the night that you had

242
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,000
your ninja milk release party Dom held a

243
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,730
small little get-together like a

244
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,800
barbecue at his house and so like a lot

245
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,690
of the rhpc guys went and we kind of

246
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,950
like hanging out he showed us around and

247
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,140
then he was like hey you guys want to

248
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,800
see this this room I made for Beth and

249
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,320
we made a room he made a room yeah yeah

250
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,550
what was the occasion well let you take

251
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,949
it away cuz you know this best

252
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,540
so basically Dom made a room for me it

253
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:09,490
was for Christmas because we have this

254
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,630
rule with like any gifts that we give

255
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,180
whether it's like birthday or Christmas

256
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:17,019
that we have to make them and it can't

257
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:19,540
be like store-bought so I made him like

258
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,949
this light-up sign and I like used power

259
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,560
tools for the first time I was really

260
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:26,140
proud of myself but he made me this room

261
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,399
that was basically he recreated my

262
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:32,680
childhood room and so he did all this

263
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,360
research apparently like looking at what

264
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,310
my room looked like and like watched all

265
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,709
my old videos when I had like hot pink

266
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,820
walls so he painted this wall hot pink

267
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:44,740
and then created this like stitch mural

268
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,519
cuz lilo and stitch is like my favorite

269
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:51,490
Disney movie and then he had these

270
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,050
pictures of me I like walk in and the

271
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,160
first thing I see are these letters at

272
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,370
the top of the window that just say

273
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,190
little Beth and then there's like all of

274
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:03,730
these pictures of me as a baby but he

275
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,059
photoshopped himself into them so it's

276
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:13,729
like a little

277
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:15,829
babies together agreed that it is creepy

278
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:18,169
like it is I thought is there though

279
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:19,339

00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,200
but good but when I see you guys

316
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:29,050

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,490
guys have met before because I mean like

320
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,620
we're just talking about this earlier

321
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,930
but you actually sing and I didn't know

322
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,769
that at first but you you guys came here

323
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,810
I don't know if you guys work together

324
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:52,540
or not but I know Dom came here as well

325
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:55,480
to work with David oh yeah we did one

326
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,220
song you guys made a song yeah Dom Dom I

327
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,529
think you guys both wrote it or dumb

328
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,680
dawn wrote that one okay it's very sweet

329
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:05,019
song mhm and I mean I was I've always

330
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,589
told Beth this but I think you know

331
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:11,850
she's one of the most underrated singers

332
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:14,350
on YouTube I think she could have done

333
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,839
music if she didn't do Beauty but you're

334
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,160
doing that right now right yeah a little

335
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,070
bit I think it's just one of those

336
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,890
things that I've dabbled in so much and

337
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:26,380
I really want to do but it's like I'll

338
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,269
do it I'll like I put out a song like

339
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,170
five years ago or something and then I

340
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:32,440
was like I don't know it's

341
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:35,680
I'm just so unsure and also I just want

342
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,910
to like I know it's one it's one of

343
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,980
those things or it's like almost waiting

344
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,290
for the right time but I also kind of

345
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,300
just wanted to perfect it more before I

346
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,160
start putting it out because I just

347
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,279
always want to give people something

348
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,019
that I feel is of substance and that I'm

349
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,940
proud of and if I feel like it's not

350
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,459
really there for me then I don't really

351
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,930
want to share it that's kind of like you

352
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:59,769
you do you should sort of like that too

353
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:05,170
like I was I was more like that and then

354
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:06,790
now it's just I make podcasts oh no I

355
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,040
mean I mean we still we still have

356
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,930
projects like that but I yeah I wanted

357
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,319
to be able to just do things that are

358
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,970
like I don't know free not having like

359
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:18,040
so much thought into every single thing

360
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,560
I still want to do those things as well

361
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,899
and I feel like you're the same way but

362
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,100
like what is your main focus right now

363
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:25,690
because you you do so many things that

364
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,269
you're doing your videos you know like

365
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,779
you said you were doing the the clothing

366
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,819
the fashion thing and then

367
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:33,079
you sing when she trying to dance to for

368
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:34,879
a little bit obviously you learning

369
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,350
dance if you're living well you're not

370
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,300
living with Dom but since you guys are

371
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,680
dating cuz all he does is dance and

372
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,170
every moment if he will be in the car

373
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,879
and he'll just start like yeah he does I

374
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,660
started doing a lot of freestyle dance

375
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:49,670
you it's really bad uh no I haven't

376
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,519
really been dancing you would think like

377
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:55,279
we don't really dance together he's

378
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,809
actually taught me a few things and he's

379
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,629
like choreographed little things for us

380
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:02,290
that we never like finished but dancing

381
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:04,220
is something that I kinda really only

382
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,160
went for with Dancing with the Stars

383
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,110
like that was the most I've ever really

384
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,170
pursued that I kind of wanted to pursue

385
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:15,079
it a little more after the fact but yeah

386
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,910
I don't know I think it was fun but it's

387
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:20,089
definitely not something that I see

388
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,279
myself doing like it being amazing fun

389
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:24,410
you were like I thought you were a

390
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:26,720
dancer from that I mean you're pretty

391
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,480
good I mean I took dance classes growing

392
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,800
up and then once I got the offer for

393
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,240
Dancing with the Stars I was like I

394
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,740
really want to do it cuz dance is always

395
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,069
something that I really enjoyed but just

396
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,870
never really went for and yeah I think I

397
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:40,160
definitely surprised myself maybe was

398
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,589
also just like having such a good

399
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480
teacher but I definitely found myself

400
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,149
doing things that I didn't know I could

401
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,920
do especially because it's so many

402
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:50,540
different styles it's like every week

403
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,399
it's like you'll have salsa then you'll

404
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,639
have like jive then you'll have like

405
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,120
contemporary and so I just became more

406
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:01,459
aware of my body which was really cool

407
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,529
but yeah I think I kind of fell in love

408
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:05,720
with dance a little bit during that show

409
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:07,220
it's just something that is kind of cool

410
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,959
to have like I think I could incorporate

411
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,309
it into certain things in the future but

412
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,260
definitely wouldn't be like my main

413
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,980
thing how long ago was that when you

414
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,970
were on that show

415
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:21,020
that was 2014 I think would you say that

416
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:23,809
you're your excitement about dance got

417
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,939
you more interested in dawn it was about

418
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,520
the time right yeah I thought about that

419
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:30,260
I don't think so

420
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,570
maybe she maybe it was like a

421
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:36,320
subconscious like wow I'm really loving

422
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:38,510
dance good this guy is a dancing that's

423
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,720
actually attractive that's actually what

424
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,549
made us like hang come together yeah

425
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,380
because it wasn't like a YouTube

426
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:47,720
YouTube creator summit like one of the

427
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,860
after parties and I was just really into

428
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,480
like anytime I would be at an

429
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,370
after-party or anything I'd always be

430
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,179
salsa dancing I don't really know how to

431
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:58,460
do it but I enjoy it and so I just

432
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:00,320
remember there was like this crowd of

433
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,929
people and I was like who here is gonna

434
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,419
salsa dance with me tonight and I kind

435
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:07,309
of knew you said that no I just thought

436
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:09,200
it I thought that every time I would

437
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:10,520
like go to a party I was like who here

438
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,580
looks like they would salsa dance with

439
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,470
me and so I knew he was a dancer

440
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,840
obviously and so we just started salsa

441
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,690
dancing and then we just like dancing

442
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,179
with my instant the attraction that was

443
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,880
actually the first time that I was like

444
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:30,020
oh he's cute because I met him before

445
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:33,110
that at the Tony Robbins conference and

446
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,360
I just he was like cool as I go cool

447
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:38,870
cool but isn't really intuitive see the

448
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,870
skills yeah I didn't see those moves I

449
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,090
was like see the advantage of being a

450
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,029
dancer because I don't know what it is

451
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,460
about dance but women just love it it is

452
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:50,960
attractive it is and yeah it's

453
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,659
attractive when someone knows how to

454
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,250
move their body mm-hmm well Paco can

455
00:18:53,659 --> 00:19:00,470
dance is how's that working not any more

456
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,279
I used to as a breakdancer b-boy oh

457
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,559
really

458
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,380
Dom did but he got more into like uh it

459
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:08,419
was a go choreo I guess Dom's well

460
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,880
versed in in dance

461
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:12,950
David and I was variants at all I'm the

462
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:21,590
worst dancer I'm too stiff like I look

463
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:23,270
like a would going back to what David

464
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,250
was saying like you're actually a good

465
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,809
singer and David doesn't just give out

466
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,880
compliments he's very blunt actually

467
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:32,470
borderline mean to people that don't

468
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:38,840
know how David is like talented people

469
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:39,980
yeah like they will be straight up and

470
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,250
he won't say you're good unless you all

471
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,140
unless you really are but he does tell

472
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,210
I've asked David before I was like can

473
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:50,600
everyone sing and what was your answer

474
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:52,460
to that all honesty you want me to be

475
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,270
honest or happy off be completely honest

476
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,320
can anyone sing or learn to sing yes yes

477
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,029
they can learn to sing but

478
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,009
but I do believe some people are born

479
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:03,529
with natural talent and some people will

480
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:05,269
never have that will never sound good

481
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:07,490
even if even if they learn they won't

482
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:09,889
have that I think weird that but with

483
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,120
dance David and our that will with dance

484
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:12,710
that's what I'm saying like I you look

485
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,940
like a dancer when you dance even he

486
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,220
looks like a dancer when he dances but

487
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,889
when David and I dance where that where

488
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:25,190
those people who just can't wait I think

489
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:27,380
I can no what I'm saying is you can

490
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,779
learn but you'll never be you never look

491
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,639
I'll never be a d-trix yeah that's for

492
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:33,379
sure

493
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:35,509
wait so you're saying so like I said

494
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:38,120
some people that are really great

495
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:40,309
singers that it's natural someone who

496
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,029
worked really hard could never like

497
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:45,889
attain that sort of I'm gonna disappoint

498
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:48,110
a lot of people no but to a certain

499
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:49,639
level it's true right I think that they

500
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,350
come down to just their natural speaking

501
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,850
voice that sounds better I don't think

502
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,889
it's about the speaking voice for me I

503
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,690
think it's more about like so the way

504
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:59,299
that I would explain is you know you

505
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,279
find young kids who are amazing singers

506
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,470
right you guys agree with that you'll

507
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,750
see like turn on on those TV shows

508
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,580
they're naturally gifted they did not

509
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,950
learn how to do that because they were

510
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,179
taught they were just born that way and

511
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,529
I think there are a lot of people like

512
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:16,429
that in many different fields like

513
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:18,950
including dance singing or intelligence

514
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:21,710
right I think like there are people who

515
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:24,440
are born with it but then I do think

516
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,230
that you could work on anything you can

517
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,470
get good to a certain point but I don't

518
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,389
know if you could achieve greatness that

519
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,159
makes sense I think it's true it's just

520
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:37,009
like being good at basketball right like

521
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,789
I could be the like I could work my ass

522
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:43,250
off and I'll still be five eight and

523
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:44,629
never in the NBA and even there are five

524
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,490
eight players shorter people who can

525
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:48,860
dunk I think no matter how much I would

526
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,350
have work like that I could come haha I

527
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,450
can done there's a basketball game that

528
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,980
Ryan and I are playing and those right

529
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,840
after the game we're kind of sitting

530
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,690
down just like relaxing and then this

531
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,649
one Asian kid just like Palm the ball

532
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:05,210
ran up and dunked and he was like a

533
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:08,580
little bit shorter and the first thing

534
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:12,120
me and Ryan did was we stood up

535
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:15,480
really he's shorter than us but like

536
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,840
possible so I mean why did I bring that

537
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,360
up

538
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,950
Oh about Island musical time yeah and

539
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,140
then in for dance like you could dance

540
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,789
because it's kind of natural for you I

541
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,899
was saying like no matter how much David

542
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:27,000
and I train we'll never

543
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:32,039
we could get good to let the point our

544
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,169
cap I think I get it yeah but like you

545
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,779
have like this high cap for like dance

546
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:42,570
and singing mm-hmm and I don't know

547
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:43,710
things that you I mean I would never do

548
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,210
that show let's put it that way

549
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,159
Dancing with the Stars you'd never do it

550
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,750
never there's got to be some great

551
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,580
incentive for me to embarrass myself

552
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,340
that way but also I think taking this

553
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,620
and in another route is like you are a

554
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,139
very kind of introverted kid it sounds

555
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,510
like but you have all these natural

556
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:01,980
talents within you that what did you

557
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,029
kind of always just know what's there or

558
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,380
was it just like oh this seems

559
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:07,860
interesting and you pick it up very

560
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,080
easily I like with the singing I feel

561
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:13,289
like I was always singing when I was

562
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,169
younger and I just remember remember

563
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:17,909
like getting mad when people in the car

564
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:21,690
would sing with me and they were like

565
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:24,330
off-key eight-year-old me so mad about

566
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,580
that that means you have really good so

567
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,980
we're saying is a pitch and like I think

568
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,860
I mean this is a question I like to ask

569
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:35,880
a lot of musicians and singers is who

570
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:38,100
and your family is musically gifted so

571
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,700
usually when I ask my musician friends

572
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,769
it's either their mom dad both grandpa

573
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,169
grandma it's always like that so I was

574
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:48,450
wondering if if that applies to you as

575
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:51,419
well maybe an uncle or not it's like

576
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:53,399
gifted and actually a lot my mom is and

577
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:57,210
my grandpa and then a lot of my cousins

578
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:58,769
is a mom so my mom sign gotcha yeah so

579
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,750
it's it's true my theory is still

580
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:03,570
correct see it so it is something you're

581
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,799
kind of born with and it is to I mean to

582
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,880
a certain degree it's gotta be genetic

583
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:11,250
right mikage in your genes because I

584
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,080
mean I it's gonna sound bad but like

585
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,419
there's certain ethnicities that ever

586
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,880
like my majority of that ethnicity can

587
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:20,159
sing you know I mean like I think the

588
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,669
majority Filipinos but a lot of

589
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,679
Filipinos can sing a lot like black

590
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,390
most of them I know can at least sound

591
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,440
better than your average person yeah I

592
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,000
don't know if that's true or not I might

593
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,340
be making stuff up but how by people I

594
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,409
know yeah are all at least somewhat

595
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,029
decent like have nice either it's a nice

596
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,169
deep voice or like they came to actually

597
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:38,539
sing or something

598
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:42,169
as a musician I will verify that okay so

599
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:44,960
I'm not being the truth I find the

600
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:46,580
african-americans Filipinos generally

601
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,470
speaking the darker you I don't know

602
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,020
what it is I don't know what it is I

603
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:54,860
think it's maybe the the their vocal

604
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,940
cords their structure darker - yeah well

605
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,960
pretty I don't know now we're just

606
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:02,539
basing it on racist on it but it's it's

607
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,299
a great root of thing it's a positive

608
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:08,179
stereotype yeah even I've heard some

609
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:11,270
like even you know African Americans are

610
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:12,860
not greats they say that I'm so bad and

611
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,870
they sing and I'm like they're so good

612
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,350
you're such a liar like you're just all

613
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:20,720
really good at singing or they have a

614
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:24,620
high cap for that right they could learn

615
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,840
to sing right yeah and it sucks being

616
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,950
Filipino and not being able to sing well

617
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,750
you're only part you know what I've

618
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,520
never heard you sing because I can

619
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:35,179
that's what they all say have you tried

620
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:43,820
yeah yeah let's hear something no next

621
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:46,640
question that was a nice tone you next

622
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,529
question okay

623
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,330
well now we know so you're gonna be a

624
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:51,140
singer dancer you're basically made to

625
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,309
be a pop star

626
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,220
you got the fashion a little bit of

627
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:57,080
everything what is in like not joking

628
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,799
around what is your next thing you want

629
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,870
to do uh I mean honestly the music is

630
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,390
one thing that I've just recently

631
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,789
started taking more seriously and I

632
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:10,640
think it's because I've been so scared

633
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:13,159
with it for so long that I just kind of

634
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,970
have been diving deeper into it recently

635
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:18,620
and yeah so definitely music stuff and

636
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,630
then just kind of getting back into

637
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:25,309
YouTube again I think that I needed to

638
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:28,610
take a break to kind of just reset and I

639
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:31,909
think I felt this almost this pressure

640
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:33,980
of also who people kind of perceived me

641
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:35,750
to be for so long especially getting

642
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,160
into it so young that was

643
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,490
kind of one of the biggest challenges I

644
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:44,480
faced was as I got older was kind of

645
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:46,880
breaking from these ideas of how people

646
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,430
saw me which definitely I was never fake

647
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,350
like that was 100% me at the time but

648
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,090
then as I started getting older and then

649
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,670
I did start having more of a social life

650
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,370
and did start like kind of exploring

651
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:01,630
myself more it didn't necessarily add up

652
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:04,940
with what people were used to seeing so

653
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:07,970
yeah I just kind of needed time to take

654
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,200
a break from all of that and it's kind

655
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:12,080
of like what you said is like I want

656
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,580
that kind of freedom back of not feeling

657
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,440
so much pressure of everything that I

658
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,080
post has to be like the most perfect

659
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,290
thing in the world right and just the

660
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,330
fact that I could actually just post is

661
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:25,040
enough and as long as I actually enjoyed

662
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,350
it that's more than enough because I

663
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,890
definitely got to a point where I wasn't

664
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:34,700
enjoying it and it was just a big stress

665
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:37,250
ball I can relate to that 100% like I

666
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,130
definitely have seen your vlogs this is

667
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,170
like a wall aback but just like knowing

668
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,240
you outside of YouTube because I met you

669
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,410
before I seen your videos and then I

670
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,820
want to go check out your videos I was

671
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:50,150
like oh that's interesting you're a lot

672
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,710
more you know like like myself a lot

673
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,770
more like energetic than you would be

674
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,300
like talking here and it is hiring and

675
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:00,050
especially for getting older since you

676
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:02,480
started at what age was that 13 yeah 13

677
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:05,030
you're basically one of those you're

678
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,970
like one of those Disney kids right who

679
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:09,590
was trapped in the same like hey guys

680
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,300
you know like one of those things and

681
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,040
then not that you were like that I'm

682
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,420
just saying the Disney no but when

683
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,280
you're trapped into this thing you just

684
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,380
it's it's exhausting because you grow up

685
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,120
everybody grows up and to a certain

686
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,860
degree you just you need to have that

687
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,440
switch and people aren't gonna like it

688
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,170
but it has to happen look at Miley Cyrus

689
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,530
and it works yeah okay

690
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:32,780
well oh we are at the sheshe brake part

691
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,190
of our show so I guess we'll be right

692
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:43,799

00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:48,669
about that but I mean that's that's what

722
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:52,419
they're interested in we where we can

723
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:55,390
take that too is a lot of youtubers or

724
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:58,270
even content creators have been taking

725
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,470
breaks lately they've been saying like

726
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,029
you know I need to I've been getting

727
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,919
burnt out or I need to take care of my

728
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:04,990
mental health and stuff and maybe this

729
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:06,549
is something that you vibe with and

730
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,840
that's something that you felt at the

731
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:10,299
time or maybe you feel a little

732
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,399
differently so maybe we can get an idea

733
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:14,380
and like pick your brain about that so

734
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,990
kind of y-you know you took a break and

735
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:20,260
what do you been doing yeah I mean I

736
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:22,990
feel like the YouTuber break thing has

737
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,640
definitely become like a thing for a lot

738
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:28,059
of people especially in the past like

739
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,590
two years I it's almost like when I

740
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,360
first saw that other people were doing

741
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,299
it it was kind of comforting I was like

742
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,350
okay I'm not the only one that's like

743
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,570
experiencing this and having these same

744
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,240
feelings coz when it happened to me I

745
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,730
feel like no one had ever talked about

746
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,440
that at that point or at least I had

747
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,170
never heard anyone talk about that and

748
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,970
so I felt like it's something going

749
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:53,170
with me that that like I'm suddenly

750
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:58,120
feeling all of this stuff like mentally

751
00:30:53,170 --> 00:31:00,070
with my craft and yeah cuz when it first

752
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,900
happened to me it was I think I didn't

753
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,600
realize that maybe I needed to take a

754
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:07,510
break but it's been incredibly helpful

755
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,120
for me I think just to kind of distance

756
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:12,130
myself a little bit and work on myself

757
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,610
because for me at least I feel like I

758
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:18,700
was so in it that I completely a little

759
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,410
bit like kind of lost a part of me and I

760
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,260
wasn't keeping up with myself so I

761
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,790
wasn't like my full self for my audience

762
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:29,470
and I feel like they definitely saw that

763
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:32,410
and yeah so I think when I first noticed

764
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:34,210
it was like 2014-2015 when I was just

765
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,520
like I need to like step away and even

766
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:40,780
doing that was so hard because people

767
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:42,160
want things like all the time and it was

768
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,780
really hard to kind of step away from

769
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,340
that and I feel like a lot of people

770
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,400
were confused because I never really

771
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,500
liked old people why I took a break but

772
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,370
it was kind of just what I needed to do

773
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:56,170
for my own mental health and just kind

774
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,780
of checking in with myself and and just

775
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,220
kind of like reconnecting with the world

776
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,800
a little bit and appreciating things

777
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,060
outside of social media that helped so

778
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,020
much because I used to find myself

779
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:10,120
almost like getting anxious if I was

780
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,980
like if I was somewhere really cool and

781
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,410
experiencing something if feeling this

782
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,420
need to have to post about it and if I

783
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,340
didn't I felt like dang it I didn't do

784
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:20,170
that and I'd be upset about it and like

785
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,380
Who am I getting upset that I didn't

786
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:25,390
show this to everybody yeah and I I

787
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,280
could have had an amazing time but I

788
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,140
didn't because I was so worried about

789
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,230
posting and I think everyone can relate

790
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:34,660
to that even you know people like girls

791
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,310
who were worried about impressing a guy

792
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,290
it's like oh I didn't post this thing

793
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:40,090
that I went to this party so I'm so mad

794
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,800
about that instead of just literally

795
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:45,220
enjoying it and not worrying about

796
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,480
having to post it because it just kind

797
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,890
of takes you out of the moment so that

798
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,780
was one of the most valuable things I've

799
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:53,410
learned is to actually just kind of

800
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:56,290
enjoy life and now it's easier to kind

801
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:59,890
of get back into it because I feel much

802
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:01,040
more myself than I was what are some

803
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,450
other ways that you can

804
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,760
said you were working on yourself

805
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:06,530
outside of you know creating creating

806
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,790
YouTube videos like what what were some

807
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,510
other things that you did for yourself

808
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:13,430
besides not posting on social media some

809
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,690
activities or like what does that mean

810
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,890
to you like to that you're working on

811
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,320
yourself is something taking a break

812
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,240
even like what does that mean yeah some

813
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,760
people may go out to a meditation

814
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,260
retreat or see you they know yeah it's

815
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,750
huge right now some people may just

816
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,450
focus on a relationship or some people

817
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,400
may go traveling like what or maybe do

818
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,310
nothing right like what what are some

819
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,350
things that you you did to kind of get

820
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:39,040
to that place where you feel free uh I

821
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:41,540
definitely didn't go on any retreats

822
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,910
yeah I feel like I didn't do any of that

823
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:46,520
like meditation which meditation is

824
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:50,090
great and I've tried it and it's cool I

825
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:54,140
just didn't really do any of that stuff

826
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:56,420
I feel like I just more so dove into

827
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:00,200
myself and asked myself questions about

828
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:02,510
like kind of where I was at with myself

829
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,270
and how I felt about myself and then I

830
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:08,290
started to realize that also because I

831
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:11,900
started making video so young I think I

832
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:15,350
I know at one point I felt this pressure

833
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:17,480
of like my appearance in my body at one

834
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,190
point because like everything that I do

835
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,410
is so like it's always been so like

836
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,690
fashion and that kind of focused so

837
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,970
obviously like my appearance was a part

838
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:29,600
of that and I think that I let that

839
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:32,060
stuff kind of tarnish my view of my like

840
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:35,240
self if that makes sense so I kind of

841
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:37,940
did a lot of like almost just like kind

842
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,500
of doing like I don't know how to

843
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,800
explain it more so just like thinking

844
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,260
about it and in understanding myself and

845
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,669
what made me kind of get farther away

846
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,669
from myself and it kind of had to love

847
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:52,370
myself again and love myself more than I

848
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:54,440
ever had before which then I think it

849
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:56,630
comes into like a whole other thing it's

850
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,040
not even about youtube as much that's

851
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,990
just kind of like life stuff that I

852
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,090
think everybody on some level at some

853
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,280
point in life experiences it's like I

854
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:07,340
feel like I didn't fully love myself at

855
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,620
that point and then kind of feeling like

856
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,300
I had to please everybody at that point

857
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,640
in my life wasn't helping the fact that

858
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,840
I wasn't really loving myself and so I

859
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,390
needed to step away from

860
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,570
everything to figure out how to get that

861
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:23,210
love back for myself and it just came

862
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:26,210
down to honestly what helped me is like

863
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:29,000
being a kid again and like just being

864
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,040
curious about life in a way that I feel

865
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,380
like I kind of got jaded to a lot of

866
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,810
things in life kind of what I was saying

867
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,790
earlier were when I was younger I didn't

868
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,530
realize what was going on to the point

869
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:42,890
that it was happening so much that I

870
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:46,250
think I failed to even be as grateful as

871
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,960
I could have been and that was one of

872
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,760
the most valuable things that I've

873
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,490
learned in like the past few years and

874
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,460
during taking a break is just how to be

875
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:57,950
amazed by life again and be excited

876
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,500
about living that was that's beautiful

877
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,850
it's great no I think a lot of people

878
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,650
need to hear that yeah and I think

879
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,810
because you're in the beauty space in

880
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:08,240
particular you know beauty is all about

881
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:09,680
kind of like an outward parent your

882
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,110
outward appearance right now if you

883
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,380
write down beauty in the superficial

884
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:17,030
form but like you know it's going back

885
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:19,070
to what you said about rediscovering

886
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:21,650
yourself and figuring out like Who am I

887
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:24,640
first before I can start putting on the

888
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,930
makeup and the outfits right I think

889
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,010
it's it's pretty interesting that you

890
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,650
brought that up because never thought of

891
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:33,200
it that way yeah and I think that's good

892
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:37,190
for other creators to hear like you said

893
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,960
at the time I guess 2015 you said you

894
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,730
kind of took your break it wasn't the

895
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,440
same thing as like this past year right

896
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:45,230
wherever you hear everybody is like oh

897
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,630
I'm burnt out I need to take a break it

898
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:49,940
definitely must have been hard to have

899
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,760
to like you had so much success and so

900
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,710
much momentum that it's not an easy

901
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,120
thing like even even now for me this is

902
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,490
like my version of a break but I'm still

903
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,350
doing stuff it's I can't even imagine

904
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,870
like I just just getting myself to this

905
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,670
point was so difficult like how did you

906
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,440
how did you convince yourself to be like

907
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,840
okay this is the best decision for my

908
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,420
life to take a break when you have all

909
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,770
this momentum going for you you have a

910
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,740
successful channel that's bringing in

911
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:17,720
revenue and you know at any point if you

912
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,760
do stop you'll still have your hardcore

913
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,620
fans but you do know if you do stop

914
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,290
there's a most youtubers know that

915
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,940
that's like deadly to your career right

916
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,590
yeah so how did you get to the point

917
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,490
where you convinced yourself or where

918
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:30,530
you add a breaking

919
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:34,940
point where you just said I have to do

920
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:37,820
it it was kind of both because I think

921
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,560
that I was continuing to try to put

922
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,600
stuff out when I was already feeling

923
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,130
that way and I just felt like it wasn't

924
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,160
as good as it could have been if I was

925
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,900
like in a better place so I knew for

926
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,369
that reason that I probably needed to

927
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:54,710
like take a break and it was really hard

928
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:58,070
to step away but I think it was a bit of

929
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:59,570
a feeling of just like I know that I

930
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,070
could be happier and I know that I could

931
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:03,440
be in a better place so maybe I just

932
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:06,200
need to to listen to how I feel right

933
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,580
now and take the action that I need to

934
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,900
and also it's like I feel like at the

935
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,500
end of the day I don't really have

936
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:20,360
anything to lose because as long it's so

937
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:23,450
cheesy your truth you know like I'm so

938
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:26,770
happy like I'm so happy with life in a

939
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:29,869
way that I'm like wasn't back then and

940
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:31,700
so I wouldn't change any of that and and

941
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:34,040
I knew that obviously it was gonna

942
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,930
change things if I wasn't uploading as

943
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,000
consistently especially if like there

944
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:39,470
are people girls my same age that are

945
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,720
posting exactly what I'm posting that

946
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:43,670
are more consistent than me obviously if

947
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,770
I'm not keeping up with that then people

948
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:47,480
would prefer to watch them but I think

949
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,520
was just learning to be okay with that

950
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,290
and not letting that it was almost more

951
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,410
of an ego thing and I feel like once I

952
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:57,500
let once I kind of understood my ego and

953
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:59,119
I was able to control that it helped so

954
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,040
much because I was like I would I had

955
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,720
these fears that didn't even really

956
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,119
exist but it was only because of my ego

957
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,160
mm-hmm fears of like other people

958
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,930
surpassing you like the girls your age

959
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,020
and stuff like that yeah talking about

960
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:13,100
yeah okay that makes sense that is a

961
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,560
tough thing to do I don't think

962
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,840
necessarily if you haven't really been a

963
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,520
creator it's hard to explain that fear

964
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,650
yeah a lot of people when you tell them

965
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,530
oh I'm burnt out or like recently like

966
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,730
Lilly as mentioned and other youtubers

967
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,720
have came on and said oh you know what

968
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,940
they're burnt out they gotta take a

969
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,410
break I see all these comments are like

970
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,270
oh wow must be tough being a millionaire

971
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,790
who's famous and they don't really

972
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:37,609
understand you know or they think it's a

973
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:39,350
lot easier to do what we do to a certain

974
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,240
degree where even if it wasn't easy

975
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,160
though it's like everybody knows

976
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,150
themselves better

977
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,250
and anyone else right so I think that

978
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,210
part of it for other creators I think

979
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,150
they understand now like that's

980
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:55,150
everybody can burn out yeah for people

981
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:57,250
who don't have these kind of who aren't

982
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,780
in these lucky fortunate situations

983
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,319
where some people just can't take those

984
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,430
breaks

985
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:05,319
what would you say that those people I

986
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,640
mean I mean it's hard I know it I'm not

987
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,539
putting you on the spot cuz I I try and

988
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,160
think about that too

989
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:10,720
because I understand what you're saying

990
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,520
but I feel like it's hard for me to

991
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,069
preach that to people who can't afford

992
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,230
to like you know that my job is too much

993
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:19,569
right I'm burnt out I need this job but

994
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,950
I have to do it how would we I'm just

995
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:22,210
trying to see for myself how do you

996
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,670
reach out to those people and give them

997
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:26,619
the same advice absolutely yeah I think

998
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,920
that there are ways that everyone can do

999
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:33,609
it to be completely honest I think that

1000
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,140
if I don't think I really what I did in

1001
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:38,079
my situation is I completely stepped

1002
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:40,210
away but I don't think that I really had

1003
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,250
to do that I think that there definitely

1004
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:46,599
was ways for me to continue what I was

1005
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:48,609
doing while being smart in accomplishing

1006
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:51,069
what I did in the past few years as far

1007
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:52,299
as like myself personal growth I think I

1008
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:55,210
could have done that simultaneously

1009
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:58,270
while staying consistent but I didn't do

1010
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,279
that I think it's because I was just so

1011
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,529
in fear I was so afraid and so confused

1012
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:04,210
that I just wanted to completely shut it

1013
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:05,559
all off but I don't think that was

1014
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,859
really necessary I think that's just

1015
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:11,140
what I felt that I needed to do because

1016
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:13,630
I look back on it and and yes I did take

1017
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:16,119
that break but part of me is like you

1018
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,130
know maybe I should have just at least

1019
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,230
stayed a little more consistent and and

1020
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,849
worked on myself so I think there's a

1021
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,859
lot that you can do even if you can't

1022
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:26,049
just completely stutter away yeah I

1023
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:27,640
think it's what I found to be the most

1024
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:31,569
valuable is literally just being able to

1025
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,789
be honest with myself and be just

1026
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:36,069
transparent about where I am personally

1027
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:37,809
and just really diving into yourself and

1028
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:40,900
that's kind of the part that can be hard

1029
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:43,660
for people too is you know it's it's

1030
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,890
being open with yourself about like what

1031
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,510
your fears are what you're afraid of

1032
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:47,980
what it is because I think also the

1033
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,680
biggest problem is that I didn't want to

1034
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,059
admit that it was my ego and I think I

1035
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,770
could have figured all that out while

1036
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:56,049
still being consistent I just kind of

1037
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:59,529
chose to step away okay with

1038
00:41:56,049 --> 00:42:01,839
it's good advice I'm wondering did you

1039
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:03,429
have like what is your circle look like

1040
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,799
your circle of friends I know you worked

1041
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:08,799
with you work with your dad he's been

1042
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:10,299
pretty integral in your career like did

1043
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:12,339
you have friends to kind of like help

1044
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:14,589
you get through this I know you're

1045
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:16,390
dating DOM but was there anybody else in

1046
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:17,890
your circle or was it your family that

1047
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:21,759
kind of helped you come to this

1048
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:25,809
realization and kind of eliminating your

1049
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:27,939
ego yeah I mean I definitely surrounding

1050
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:31,390
myself with friends is helpful and I've

1051
00:42:27,939 --> 00:42:33,549
done that it's also nice just to like

1052
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:35,019
like I said just be more in the moment

1053
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:37,630
with people because I feel like I wasn't

1054
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,319
always the best at doing that so yeah

1055
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,079
definitely

1056
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,309
just making more time for friends and my

1057
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:46,029
family has always been really supportive

1058
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:48,969
my dad has been there since the first

1059
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:51,069
video so I always like go to him for

1060
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:53,079
that kind of stuff as well because he's

1061
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:55,719
always very encouraging and also kind of

1062
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:57,459
helps me remember like why I started

1063
00:42:55,719 --> 00:43:00,039
doing it all in the first place and it

1064
00:42:57,459 --> 00:43:02,170
wasn't for obviously like we didn't know

1065
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:04,119
that any of the success was even

1066
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,739
possible at that point like back then

1067
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,319
it's like we didn't even know that you

1068
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:10,479
could make a career out of it and so he

1069
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:14,140
always kind of reminds me of that like

1070
00:43:10,479 --> 00:43:15,759
the little me that started it so yeah

1071
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,339
and when you started you were you're

1072
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:20,410
pretty young so like like how do you

1073
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:22,599
balance like your dad like the

1074
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,969
relationship between your dad as someone

1075
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:27,699
who's integrating your business and then

1076
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:31,630
also your dad like it's kind of it can

1077
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:34,779
get a little weird right I mean yeah I

1078
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:36,489
think it was definitely it was

1079
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:38,759
definitely more challenging when we

1080
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:42,339
lived together because it was hard to

1081
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:44,679
separate the two but once I kind of

1082
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:46,869
moved out and like had my own place and

1083
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:48,069
all of that it honestly got way easier I

1084
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:49,119
think there's something about it's like

1085
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:52,239
I don't really want to talk about

1086
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,859
business over dinner you know it's like

1087
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,359
you want to separate the two so I think

1088
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:57,579
that's the only time that it was really

1089
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,339
challenging but everything else it's

1090
00:43:57,579 --> 00:44:02,380
like he's always just down for whatever

1091
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:04,239
I want to do and just backing me up and

1092
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:08,920
whatever my decision is for whatever it

1093
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:09,970
may be but yeah he's definitely I got to

1094
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,340
I got to know him

1095
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,290
better than you actually on the a couple

1096
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,970
of tours that we've done like a lot of

1097
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:18,880
times you'd be like you and your dad and

1098
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:20,290
your mom yeah and basically be with your

1099
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,810
mom and we just be hanging out with your

1100
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,920
dad and I guess that's kind of speaks to

1101
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,250
like what you were saying like you were

1102
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,440
kind of like to yourself kind of thing

1103
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:31,180
but he would constantly be like he has

1104
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,359
good ideas he's constantly like pitching

1105
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:36,010
he's like he's always coming to music

1106
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:37,390
not even for you he's like hey what if

1107
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,640
we did this what if you did this and he

1108
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,170
keep pitching ideas so I think I know

1109
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,630
what you mean when you say like once you

1110
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,190
weren't in the household because if he's

1111
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:46,540
constantly I don't know if he did the

1112
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,130
same thing to you but to me I was like

1113
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,650
these are good but if I had that every

1114
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:52,480
single day like morning and night I

1115
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,670
think that would be pretty yeah it could

1116
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,160
be a lot I mean it's all great intention

1117
00:44:54,670 --> 00:45:02,470
like oh he's right he's great yeah he

1118
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:04,060
definitely yeah I think kind of tying it

1119
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:07,000
back to what David said in the first

1120
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:09,670
half where music can be tied to like

1121
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,250
your parents and stuff so in the aspect

1122
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:13,869
of like how hard you were grinding and

1123
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:16,089
like possibly like you know you burnt

1124
00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:17,700
yourself out and stuff like it sounds

1125
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:21,130
like maybe you got that from your dad

1126
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,780
just that that work ethic and yeah I'm

1127
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,589
just curious as to what like what does

1128
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,320
he do

1129
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:29,020
besides you know before like you were

1130
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,540
doing YouTube instead of farmer yeah he

1131
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,670
worked on dairy farms cuz we grew up

1132
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:36,640
like central California so it's like

1133
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:43,960
only dairy farms like no shopping malls

1134
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:45,700
los Manos our from Fresno cuz like

1135
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,200
basically if we wanted to go to any

1136
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,970
shopping mall we'd have to either go to

1137
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,160
Modesto at Fresno cuz there's like

1138
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,510
there's nothing in the town we got a

1139
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,160
target and everybody was like really

1140
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:56,440
stoked about I was like my where I'm

1141
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,230
from Hilo small small town yeah yeah

1142
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:02,020
super small town so he would just work

1143
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:04,630
on like electricity and like building

1144
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:06,670
dairies and he owned his own dairy

1145
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,990
business so he was like knew how to be a

1146
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,450
business owner but yeah I was all like

1147
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:12,910
dairy farms up until I asked him to be

1148
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:16,089
my manager do you know to milk a cow I

1149
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:19,180
don't I've been around a lot of cows but

1150
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:21,310
I never never tried to milk when I had a

1151
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,589
lot of pet cows too because we lived

1152
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:25,989
though isn't it

1153
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:27,609
you have to you know hey what do you

1154
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:30,509
mean I mean I was a farmer

1155
00:46:27,609 --> 00:46:39,369
I guess dairy everyone talked about

1156
00:46:30,509 --> 00:46:42,099
their pets in there also if you're no

1157
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:46,599
they just they went to another farm they

1158
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:50,890
just went through the other I mean I I

1159
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:52,150
don't know I'm family members who had

1160
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,430
college but they had them for different

1161
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:56,710
reasons

1162
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:58,329
yeah we we had cuz we lived literally on

1163
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:00,190
a dairy farm one of the farms that he

1164
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:02,410
worked on and so we just had like a

1165
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:04,299
bunch of cows I remember one night like

1166
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:05,859
two o'clock in the morning there was a

1167
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:08,710
bunch of noise outside of the house and

1168
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:11,109
I woke up and there was just like cows

1169
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:13,749
like I opened the window and just a cow

1170
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:15,609
like right there at the window cuz they

1171
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:18,099
just broke free and so your sleep

1172
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:20,920
surrounding our honey I grew up with

1173
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:22,599
cows too all around me so it's like that

1174
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,900
constant I know I can I can just smell

1175
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:25,589
it

1176
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,729
I can smell where you live manure yeah

1177
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:31,299
do you have any siblings

1178
00:47:27,729 --> 00:47:34,089
everyone's sister younger older she is

1179
00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:36,940
older she's five years older and she has

1180
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:39,940
two beautiful daughters what does she

1181
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:42,759
think about your YouTube career and she

1182
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:45,130
actually started a channel like shortly

1183
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:46,329
after I did and she was going with it

1184
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:49,029
for a while I don't know if she's still

1185
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:52,239
posting on it but yeah she got into it

1186
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:53,619
for a second - it's funny cuz I think

1187
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:55,749
she might have made fun of me right in

1188
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:57,579
the beginning when I started and then

1189
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:59,380
she was like I'm gonna get on this - in

1190
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,249
what way like what are you doing yeah do

1191
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,979
you think you are

1192
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:04,749
yeah I feel like everybody yeah I got

1193
00:48:02,979 --> 00:48:07,299
about so much flesh in the beginning

1194
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:10,019
yeah she was probably had public school

1195
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:13,329
like my sister makes YouTube videos

1196
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:15,579
public school yeah okay and then you

1197
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:19,660
were saying on the break that you you

1198
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:21,569
chose to go do private schooling yeah

1199
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:25,210
and your sister chose the public route

1200
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:28,029
why did you choose private school

1201
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:31,930
instead of public I just was I just

1202
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:34,029
never really liked public school and my

1203
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:35,319
parents just gave us a choice or like if

1204
00:48:34,029 --> 00:48:36,580
you want to be homeschooled you can so I

1205
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:39,220
was like okay I'm

1206
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:41,530
doing that I just felt like I just felt

1207
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:44,320
like I was wasting time like in between

1208
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,910
like if I cuz if I had it my way I was

1209
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,700
like I just want to go to school do all

1210
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:50,350
the work no recess no lunch just like

1211
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,960
let me do all the work and then go home

1212
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:55,090
and that's what homeschooling was is it

1213
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,220
still like five hours a day or well well

1214
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:58,810
how long at school yeah how does that

1215
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,760
work how does the homeschooling system I

1216
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:02,530
never asked this to someone before but

1217
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,030
I'm does it yeah what do you wake up at

1218
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:07,450
a certain time do you just do York when

1219
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,230
you want um your yeah you basically do

1220
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:10,810
whenever you want

1221
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:13,630
that was a problem though is I feel like

1222
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:16,390
it definitely taught me a lot about like

1223
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:18,160
managing my own stuff and like having a

1224
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:21,340
schedule a little bit though because

1225
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,680
actually not maybe not because I started

1226
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:26,890
to get in this habit where I would do

1227
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,540
all my work for the week like the night

1228
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,610
before I had to go in because basically

1229
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:33,520
I still had a teacher so I'd meet with a

1230
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:35,470
teacher once a week and I would give her

1231
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,540
all of my work for that week and then if

1232
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:40,000
there were any tests then I would do

1233
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,950
those tests and so basically it's like

1234
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,900
if I had to meet with her every Tuesday

1235
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,120
I would literally leave all my work for

1236
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,830
like Monday you'd procrastinate which is

1237
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:52,000
the same thing as every other student in

1238
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:55,060
public school really I would do my work

1239
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,560
as soon like in class if I could like

1240
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,230
homework and stuff like that just so I

1241
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,550
could like have fun at home it was just

1242
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:02,920
so I don't have to worry about it

1243
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:04,720
I was opposite well anyway that's in

1244
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,460
know you had a I thought it was your

1245
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,380
parents that I you know I don't know

1246
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,900
much yeah well I mean I would like

1247
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,330
supervise I guess or like held me here

1248
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,850
and there but yeah it's like I had an

1249
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:18,520
actual teacher technically got it so

1250
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:21,910
with a teacher like go to your home or

1251
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:24,220
you me now at this place and there's

1252
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:26,440
other homeschooled kids or is it just

1253
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:27,910
like one thing she's you would like go

1254
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,270
in and there were like all the teachers

1258
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:41,080
had friends from public school and then

1259
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:42,910
also once I became homeschooled for a

1260
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,680
couple years that's when I was in dance

1261
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:47,230
class and then I took theatre for a

1262
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:49,750
little bit too so I made new friends

1263
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:50,500
through that well do you still keep in

1267
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:03,300
I should

1268
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:07,560
well that was one long Twitter question

1269
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:09,970
do you have any scary fan encounters oh

1270
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,750
it's a pretty consistent question yeah

1271
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:13,510
yeah hurry

1272
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:20,380

interesting creepy yeah okay a really

1274
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:27,430
good pitch that was a good pitch the way

1275
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:30,760
that she said yeah you got some okay hmm

1276
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:39,190
well I have one that's like weird to

1277
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:43,840
talk about now a curious no um this guy

1278
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:48,760
a while back this was probably I don't

1279
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:50,980
even remember May 2013 2014 this guy

1280
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:54,580
that watched my videos he was a lot

1281
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:58,150
older than me maybe by like twenty or

1282
00:51:54,580 --> 00:52:00,390
thirty years he came to a couple

1283
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:05,349
meet-and-greets and it was just like

1284
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:09,310
strange scenarios but then the weirdest

1285
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:11,650
one was I got a like a package or like a

1286
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:13,060
letter to my house

1287
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:14,619
this is when I was still living with my

1288
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:17,530
family and we opened it up in there was

1289
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:19,000
like this USB thing and so we put it in

1290
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:22,030
the computer and it was the video of

1291
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,040
this guy and he just started saying like

1292
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:27,400
all this stuff and he was just like so I

1293
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,560
have your address and like I'm going to

1294
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,359
tell you how I found it and he like

1295
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,730
pulled up the listing of like my house

1296
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,500
and it was like clicking through the

1297
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:39,670
photos for some reason I'm like yes I

1298
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,990
know what my house looks like photos of

1299
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:43,450
your house well like has he found the

1300
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,890
listing of the house mine and so just

1301
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:46,869
like started clicking through it and

1302
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:48,040
just like was like you should like just

1303
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:49,930
basically he was telling me like I

1304
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,520
should be more careful with my personal

1305
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,960
information cuz like it could really for

1306
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,599
him he was like it could affect your

1307
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,560
well-being and I was like you're so

1308
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,869
right

1309
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,869
and just like said some like honestly

1310
00:52:58,869 --> 00:53:04,600
weird stuff and it really freaked me out

1311
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:06,910
and from that point I was like I can't

1312
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,880
live here anymore is that why you moved

1313
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:12,160
um yeah that was one of the reasons oh

1314
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,380
so this is a little more recent then not

1315
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,180
like when you first started no well yeah

1316
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:22,780
this was like probably four or five

1317
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:26,740
years ago yeah what about your your

1318
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:28,600
parents are not there anymore in that at

1319
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,640
that location at the gun oh no we all

1320
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:33,190
moved from there yeah so that was

1321
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,800
probably the most like creepy weird

1322
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:37,060
situation yeah

1323
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,520
and then I've just other than that it's

1324
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:42,900
just been like little mishaps here and

1325
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,920
there mm-hmm well what about like weird

1326
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,000
interactions because you do a lot of

1327
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,440
meeting greets and stuff

1328
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,980
what's the weirdest thing somebody said

1329
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,080
to you uh I got proposed to a lot but I

1330
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:56,550

but shorter that too yeah it's

1338
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,210
interesting because people see and I'm

1339
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:15,190
sure it's even worse for you because

1340
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:16,480
you're in the beauty space right well I

1341
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,830

1342
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,820
do they come up to you and be like oh

1343
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:23,800
you look good and you're in your videos

1344
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:25,900
they say they say I've not seen that

1345
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,250
before it's just like they don't mean it

1346
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,940
as insulting they're like oh you're a

1347
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,870
lot taller or oh yeah you look a lot

1348
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,520
skinnier in your videos or something

1349
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,540
like I've gotten all of those I've

1350
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,160
gotten that too I don't know if it's the

1351
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:38,710
same for like you cuz you're a girl

1352
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,270
no I the only one I've gotten is height

1353
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:43,030
is like a lot Oh really like oh wow

1354
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:47,200
you're a lot shorter in person you take

1355
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:48,880
that as a dis or I mean I yeah not so

1356
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,800
much anymore but back then it was like I

1357
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,840
was really I really hated being so sore

1358
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,370
I hated being five three and so when

1359
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,290
people would say that I'm like thank you

1360
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:57,460
for reminding me

1361
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,200
but that was probably the only thing

1362
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,590
there was one time at a meet-and-greet

1363
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,640
this wasn't like she didn't say anything

1364
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,930
maybe it was the lack of her saying

1365
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,820
something that made it happen is like

1366
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:09,550
she basically wanted me to give a

1367
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:12,070
piggyback ride but I didn't know that

1368
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:13,510
she like maybe she told me but I didn't

1369
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:15,640
hear it cuz I was like really loud so I

1370
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,539
was like this girl she comes up she just

1371
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:22,669
jumps on my back and

1372
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:25,849
what that's that's assault she jumped on

1373
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:27,289
my back and I just what obviously wasn't

1374
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:30,909
expecting it so I just fell to the

1375
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:30,909
ground and I was like wearing a dress

1376
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:37,519
fall to the floor and she immediately

1377
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:39,649
just like gets back up and runs away and

1378
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:42,799
that was yeah so embarrassed

1379
00:55:39,649 --> 00:55:45,619
I felt so bad press charges against her

1380
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:47,479
that's why she ran she was so happy like

1381
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:49,909
she doesn't she just wanted like a cute

1382
00:55:47,479 --> 00:55:53,149
picture how could you I know that's

1383
00:55:49,909 --> 00:55:57,319
funny if she's listening you're

1384
00:55:53,149 --> 00:56:00,289
remembered now have you ever gotten any

crazy gifts cuz I know I know from what

1386
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:05,779

1387
00:56:03,649 --> 00:56:09,109
extravagant gifts from fans than males

1388
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:10,699

hour early it really la people are

1404
00:57:03,109 --> 00:57:06,949
always late so much that I literally was

1405
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:09,799
like should I not go in it's like 10

1406
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:13,279
minutes early maybe I should wait yeah

1407
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:16,989
that's very proud of us but other than

1408
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:19,939
that other than that uh most proud of

1409
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:23,929
like that's a tough yeah like in what

1410
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:25,969
genre of life like whatever you want it

1411
00:57:23,929 --> 00:57:27,289
to be yeah let's say career do you feel

1412
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:31,109
like um do you feel like you're

1413
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:33,749
successful now I do

1414
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:37,140
you didn't when you were actually making

1415
00:57:33,749 --> 00:57:38,430
videos um you had to yeah yeah

1416
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,319
definitely

1417
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:44,249
I think I also feel it like in a

1418
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:46,499
different way now where I just feel like

1419
00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:48,599
I I mean I feel like I know a little

1420
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:51,779
more like I still have obviously so much

1421
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:55,019
to learn but I feel like I I feel

1422
00:57:51,779 --> 00:57:57,450
success in a way of like I guess what I

1423
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:59,160
understand and what I'm aware of now and

1424
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:04,799
like just kind of how I define success

1425
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:07,229
too because I think like how I defined

1426
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:11,700
success in the past was maybe a little

1427
00:58:07,229 --> 00:58:14,099
different than I define it now but as

1428
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:15,420
far as like my like biggest

1429
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:17,579
accomplishment or like things I'm most

1430
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:21,989
proud of I think we I think your answer

1431
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:23,219
is great like yeah yeah like I think I'm

1432
00:58:21,989 --> 00:58:25,589
definitely proud of everything that I've

1433
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:27,869
done career-wise like obviously I'm like

1434
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:29,910
whoa that was that's really cool I did

1435
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:31,440
all that especially starting so young

1436
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:33,869
and not knowing that any of that was

1437
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,259
possible and like building something at

1438
00:58:33,869 --> 00:58:39,089
this age and also just doing something

1439
00:58:37,259 --> 00:58:41,069
that I never thought I would do cuz I

1440
00:58:39,089 --> 00:58:43,289
just never saw myself as that person and

1441
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:45,959
even the people around me never saw me

1442
00:58:43,289 --> 00:58:47,880
as that person so I'm definitely really

1443
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:51,749
proud of that and I definitely felt that

1444
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:54,509
success but I'm also really proud of how

1445
00:58:51,749 --> 00:58:56,999
much I've evolved as a person and how I

1446
00:58:54,509 --> 00:58:59,999
also define success now because I feel

1447
00:58:56,999 --> 00:59:01,769
like it's just a lot healthier and more

1448
00:58:59,999 --> 00:59:03,660
fulfilling that's a good answer to a

1449
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:06,029
very broad question yeah and if you

1450
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:07,829
didn't if you didn't feel successful I

1451
00:59:06,029 --> 00:59:14,609
was gonna say you should because you're
