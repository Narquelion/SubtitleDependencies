like to think about all the good things

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,210
that happen in the year but I'm a

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,310
pessimistic person I see the glass

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,240
half-empty even when it's full so here

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,470
are a few reasons why 2009 sucked let's

22
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,420
start off with one of the biggest events

23
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,710
of all that's right Michael Jackson's

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,300

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,559
people talking about how sad Michael

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,300
Jackson's death because everybody knows

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,369
how sad his death was what about Farrah

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,470

29
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,030
before him she was first she won yet

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,200
nobody gave a damn because apparently

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,119
Michael Jackson's death was more

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,160

Billy Mays you know who that is right

OxiClean so I did in my opinion he was

52
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:59,940
