00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,820
instead of basketball even though I

38
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,290
loved basketball I was not good at it

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,700
and I was a little bit better at

40
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,799

mean nothing to them you got to do

116
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,390
something for them that money can't buy
