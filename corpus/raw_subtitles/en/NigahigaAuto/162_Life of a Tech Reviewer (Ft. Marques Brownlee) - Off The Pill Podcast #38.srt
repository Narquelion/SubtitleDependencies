know if you want to bring it up I do

30
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:19,799
you're here dude so I came out here

31
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,689
we're in LA for there is a Motorola

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,189
event where they they announced you know

33
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,860
you've probably had the razor one of the

34
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,890
most popular phones ever made a folding

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,360
screen version of it and so it was

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,530
they're having this announcement event

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,390
it was cool we got to see it in person

38
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,100
it was revealed mm-hmm but the event

39
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,930
itself was pretty bad

40
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,380
and I think kind of like roasting them

41
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,439
on in my video in other places but it's

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,090
a it's happened it's out there now it's

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,890
it's out there that Motorola doesn't

44
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,149
know how to throw events I can tell it's

45
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,040
been a while yeah well the last phone

46
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,740
they even had well we have a lot of

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,939
mid-range phones like their Moto G is

48
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,439
one of the most popular like $350 phones

49
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,180
and so they don't really have to do a

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,250
big showy fancy event for it they just

51
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,899
put it out and suddenly it's the most

52
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,750
well selling phone on Amazon because

53
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,780
people love cheap phones really oh but

54
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,760
you know big 900 this is a $1500 phone

55
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,950
they got to do some some showy stuff

56
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,160
they tried to put on an event Diplo was

57
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:25,890
there but it wasn't that great was the

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,300
music good no sorry but in general I

59
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,430
mean like you said you like the phone

60
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,110
though yeah I mean it was so I didn't

61
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,140
even use a razor but like I could tell

62
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,420
like just from holding it like wow this

63
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,400
is kind of cool a little folding screen

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,670
thing is still pretty sweet I don't know

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,250
if it's worth $1500 oh my gosh I think

66
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,720
you have to really love that nostalgia

67
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,550
that they're sort of wrapping it in and

68
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,470
I think a lot of people will try to get

69
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,820
it for that reason but yeah I mean I saw

70
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,220
a mean movie I thought it was fake but

71
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,140
that's I mean it does look cool I mean I

72
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,120
don't know at functionality-wise I don't

73
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,040
know but and that's kind of a thing that

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,020
uh other companies are pushing right the

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,830
foldable screen stuff yeah yeah yeah

76
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,750
Samsung has one Huawei has one this

77
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,100
company royal made one there's like a

78
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,360
couple floating out there but they're

79
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:14,310
all over $2,000 so on one hand this is

80
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,070
one of the cheaper folding screen phones

81
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,840
but it's still like an iPhone is you

82
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,060
know a thousand eleven hundred bucks and

83
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,890
most people are just just getting a new

84
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,840
iPhone right so you gotta you gotta have

85
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,370
a real reason to spend that much so

86
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,959
right they're trying so you're

87
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,490
constantly going to these different

88
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,350
events and releases and stuff because I

89
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,600
mean that's what you do yeah and I'm

90
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,330
sure people invite you and bring you out

91
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,770
because it benefits them the thing I

92
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,420
appreciate is that you're pretty honest

93
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,820
with your reviews like it's not always

94
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,270
positive and I'm sure they're bringing

95
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,680
out or even paying you how do you manage

96
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,330
that if some if someone's bringing you

97
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,920
out and even if I don't know maybe they

98
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,420
don't but I'm sure there must be like

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,190
some kind of compensation right since

100
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,820
you're doing them free promo there has

101
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,610
never been ever so I've done so I yeah

102
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,110
fly to events I go I pay for the flight

103
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,300
in the hotel really go out there they

104
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,459
always invite me and it'll be up to me

105
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,570
to decide is it worth going like is this

106
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,030
one of those things that people are

107
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,650
interested in should I go see it or not

108
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,750
the Motorola one I was like yeah people

109
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,459
who will care about this folding phone

110
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,100
like or the more interesting things this

111
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,780
year but yeah a lot of times there is

112
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,450
events that are just sort of more casual

113
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,540
or and I'll just not go or they'll

114
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,250
invite me in a

115
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,490
I have to decide it's worth it but in

116
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,590
general I just know that valuing my

117
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,210
honesty yeah like is actually that's the

118
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,220
reason I'm there is to give you my

119
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,600
impressions what I really think is the

120
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,980
product worth the money that either

121
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,900
they're announcing they're gonna charge

122
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,040
for it that's what I'm there to show so

123
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,330
if I'm not honest and none of that's

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,980
worth it for anyone right right right

125
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,520
right yeah okay well that's I mean

126
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,400
that's good to know

127
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,950
yeah so how long exactly have you been

128
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,950
doing it 2009 was the first video so

129
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,860
almost 11 years 11 years do you still I

130
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,630
mean it seems like you enjoy it but yeah

131
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,950
at some point I mean I'm sure it's

132
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,270
exciting as you you're really into it

133
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,320
but some point is there ever time where

134
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:04,300
you're just like man I just want try

135
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,980
other stuff kind of yes but also so much

136
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,120
of what I'm into is trying to make the

137
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,300
videos as good as possible

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,680
uh-huh and the more you do in this I'm

139
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,600
sure you know like in this world of like

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,270
trying to make videos unique and better

141
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,370
the more you find that you can also try

142
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,800
to do mm-hm and so we're in this like

143
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,170
crazy world of like we got this camera

144
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,790
robot that's specifically made for

145
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,740
moving a camera

146
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,600
it's you'd see a robot in like a factory

147
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,640
that would like move parts around mm-hmm

148
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,260
a company has like written software to

149
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,090
control it and keyframe it and so now

150
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,650
we're attaching the camera to it and

151
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,570
like having the robot do crazy camera

152
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,860
moves we're at this point now we're like

153
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,290
that's the type of fun that we have

154
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,120
making a video well that's kind of where

155
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,620
exactly where like if I was just doing

156
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,510
the same type of video I did eight years

157
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,940
ago I'd probably be really bored but

158
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,920
that's just just advancing your craft

159
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,570
actually exactly it just so happens to

160
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,280
be something you're still interested in

161
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,860
yeah yeah that's always gonna be new

162
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,020
tech exactly that's part of why my job

163
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,810
is easy I don't have to be interesting

164
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,150
and exciting and I mean I guess often

165
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,190
you know you have to be a little more

166
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,650
than my normal self but I like the tech

167
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,760
has to be interesting and so I don't

168
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,440
have to work as hard as the engineers

169
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,690
trying to get everyone's attention right

170
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,300
have you always been into tech like what

171
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,920
what got you started and all that yeah I

172
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,590
feel like I have pretty much always been

173
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,270
into tech somewhat of a nerd my dad was

174
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,600
an IT I don't know if that had anything

175
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,950
to do with it but you know finding you

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,020
know computer when I was in high school

177
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,580
and buying my first iPod touch and being

178
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,710
like this is amazing I went on box it in

179
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,660
front of a camera like that's probably a

180
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,740
pretty nerdy thing to do so like I've

181
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,840
always been into tech

182
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,150
someone I also read that you majored in

183
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,699
business and information technology that

184
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,220
that must also play into like what you

185
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:47,229
know your your passions right yeah yeah

186
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,780
I and I went to a tech school so that's

187
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:53,110
like almost everyone there was technical

188
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,660
in some way I've you know I always had

189
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,310
the my best score all nine times I took

190
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,069
the SAT it was always the math section

191
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,740
so I feel like I've always yeah had sort

192
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,180
of a technical inclination but then it's

193
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,979
just exciting like new gadgets are just

194
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,280
fun so it sounds like you were made for

195
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:11,169
this like with your dad being an IT do

196
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,819
you talk to him a lot about like

197
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:14,139
different gadgets that come out and was

198
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:17,680
that was that always like a part of your

199
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:20,530
life growing up uh yeah and his job is

200
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,580
like about like solutions in a way so

201
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,479
software solutions like custom you know

202
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,009
infrastructure type stuff so it's not

203
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,440
even like the gadgets he's like more

204
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,150
like behind the scenes but even that

205
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,650
like now that's like what we talk about

206
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,270
is like did you see this new phone or

207
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,860
are you trying out the Chromebooks right

208
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,440
now what's your deal so like yeah that's

209
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,159
just sort of always been part of what we

210
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,469
talk about and how old are you 25 25

211
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:46,210
yeah and you've been doing like

212
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:49,630
interested in tech stuff for a long time

213
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:53,199
since like a young age then yeah and was

214
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,240
it ever an issue where you were growing

215
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,409
up like that people because you know a

216
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,060
lot of people are like oh black people

217
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,830
should be athletic which you are because

218
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:10,030
you'd play on a professional Frisbee

219
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:13,719
team and currently yeah team yeah it's a

220
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:15,250
pretty new world a pro ultimate Ultimate

221
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:18,460
Frisbee is like 50 years old but yeah

222
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,960
row ultimate is pretty new yeah

223
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,210
does that mean you get paid to play the

224
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,069
game someone yeah it's almost nobody's

225
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,080
full-time job yeah everyone who plays

226
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,449
professional too prefers me pretty much

227
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,000
always also has there a doctor a teacher

228
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,370
or whatever uh-huh but yeah when we go

229
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,409
out and we play in front of a stand full

230
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,570
of fans and there's referees and it's

231
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:41,169
like it feels like a pro thing that's

232
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:43,240
like the craziest part yeah like what

233
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,949
else things like you're not only smart

234
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,750
you do have the athletic side so but did

235
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:48,550
you ever have to deal with people

236
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,279
teasing you because like oh why don't

237
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,220
you play like

238
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,649
or whatever yes dear - yeah I don't know

239
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,569
if it probably wasn't ever teasing as

240
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,310
much as it was just like it almost seems

241
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,709
like an innocent question like anytime I

242
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,740
like meet someone and I walk in the room

243
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:05,269
and I'm a 6-3 black guy and they're like

244
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,860
basketball right that's usually what

245
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,980
they assume I actually remember pretty

246
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,889
recently I like called an uber from

247
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,600
Newark Airport and I like timed it

248
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:17,029
perfectly so that I was walking out the

249
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,410
airport as the uber pulled up and I like

250
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,350
walk out the airport and as I was

251
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,670
getting in some like lady saw that and

252
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,170
literally was like I don't know who you

253
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,749
are but I'm sure you're probably an

254
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,519
athlete so hi whoa just because like she

255
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:31,069
assumed that that's like something like

256
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,660
and like a Giants player random just a

257
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:34,220
random person whoa do you take offense

258
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,670
to those things I don't take offense

259
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,620
well she's also not wrong she doesn't

260
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,749
dude you're a pro at yeah it's like it's

261
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,160
almost like the the implication is like

262
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:45,050
that's definitely what you're probably

263
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,319
gonna be doing and I watch basketball I

264
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,300
love basketball but yeah that's I get

265
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:53,930
the innocent assumptions I think you

266
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:56,149
have a tuna so kinda I watched the

267
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,740
Rockets games oh and that's because I

268
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,930
was following Chris Paul for like the

269
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,459
last like five or six years now that

270
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,410
he's not when he got to the Rockets I

271
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:05,480
started watching them and then James

272
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,860
Harden started having historic seasons

273
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,360
and now he's on the Thunder which is way

274
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,000
like the sighting so I'm just a Rockets

275
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,910
viewer now really but you're from New

276
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,189
York

277
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,689
like the nets are over the Nets I

278
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:19,579
started liking the New Jersey Nets

279
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:22,910
they moved to New York yep they're

280
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:23,629
pretty great but the Knicks voice - my

281
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,389
dad's a Knicks fan

282
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:29,360
I apologize every time that he's still

283
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:31,339
in expand to him but I yeah I've never

284
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,230
really had like an allegiance like to a

285
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:36,170
city I just want to respect some players

286
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,209
I I think something about his game like

287
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,149
I've been a defensive player in Ultimate

288
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,139
Frisbee and Chris Paul's defense

289
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:43,279
specifically we're the same height and I

290
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:46,040
feel like I watch him move and I'm like

291
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,389
that dudes like n basically I think he's

292
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,699
like 6 1 yeah there's something like

293
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:51,199
that but like he's an awesome defender

294
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:53,360
and his IQ is off the charts and I just

295
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:56,029
like watching smart players be at him no

296
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,819
because you've met a lot of I've met

297
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,459
some players yeah I have not met Chris

298
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:02,340
Paul but I have been to a couple Rockets

299
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,740
games

300
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,330
yeah yeah Bettina I have always been a

301
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,690
Spurs fan it's personal to get pick

302
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:11,970
rivals kinda they've ended the rocket

303
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,580
season once or twice yeah and well I

304
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,680
think we're we we've got we've have a

305
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,270
bigger rivalry with Dallas to be fair

306
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,589
from back in the day anyway we're

307
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,390
irrelevant now

308
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:25,110
so I think you can make the playoffs

309
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,640
here [ __ ] let's see man we'll see but

310
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,260
that's kinda surprising actually you're

311
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,330
a Houston fan and Chris Paul

312
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,480
but speaking of people that you've met I

313
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,650
mean you just a quick youtube search

314
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,140
Google search the people that you've

315
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,800
interviewed and talk to is it's kind of

316
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,089
amazing

317
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
and I just thought we'd bring it up I

318
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:44,190
mean like Bill Gates

319
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,050
Elon Musk Kobe Bryant Neil deGrasse

320
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,120
Tyson Will Smith in the most recent

321
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,070
rewind just said he's one of the first

322
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,620
things he says is your name yeah I mean

323
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,860
that's gotta be kind of cool pretty wild

324
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,210
yeah it's always fascinating when I do

325
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,460
like an interview or something like that

326
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,839
to figure out like every interview yeah

327
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,940
every interview has its own like

328
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,800
circumstance of like you know someone's

329
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,960
on a press tour or they're they're just

330
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,070
trying to do their YouTube presence

331
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,020
whatever they're trying to do Robles

332
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,670
yeah and it's always fascinating to like

333
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,930
try to figure out what that situation is

334
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:17,970
and yes some of them are just like they

335
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,140
just want it to be in a video they just

336
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,600
wanted to be on the channel Neil

337
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,640
deGrasse Tyson was doing he was shooting

338
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,630
some of his TV show called star talk

339
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,600
radio show

340
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,280
Macie million a radio show and there's

341
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,930
like we got to get you in and they just

342
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,089
saw in your work

343
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,560
yeah and I think obviously the audience

344
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:37,230
has part to do with that but like the

345
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,270
tech connection and a lot of times they

346
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,070
they want to be in this tech world and

347
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,350
they don't know exactly how to but

348
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,730
obviously they've watched some videos or

349
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,970
something that gets them interested

350
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,860
that's been a way to do that you want

351
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,300
had no other reason he's just like yeah

352
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,380
I'll do it

353
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,410
wasn't he doesn't have any reason to do

354
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,600
a press tour but like down to do yeah so

355
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,100
so was it a combination of you reaching

356
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,970
out to some folks and then some of them

357
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,800
reaching out to you definitely yeah

358
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,660
probably about half and half a lot of

359
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,880
people have their team's reach out and

360
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,620
it's always like their team's trying to

361
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,140
reach out to my team but my team's just

362
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,690
me so it's just me answering their email

363
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,300
are you not represented by neh

364
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,640
I do manager yeah I do have an agency

365
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,180
and they have worked it on like a couple

366
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,070
smaller like sponsored projects but

367
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,100
every single one of the interviews has

368
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,540
been through me so yeah it's just them

369
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,350
emailing me like who do we get in touch

370
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,970
with I'm like me oh wow you have a

371
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,980
personal touch on there I guess then

372
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,240
that exactly yeah and I can talk

373
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,650
creative with them pretty much right off

374
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,090
the bat usually they're like what can we

375
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,440
can we do a video and I'm like well

376
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,420
here's the talking tech series you've

377
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,330
probably seen this and we can talk about

378
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,520
whatever tech stuff that they're into so

379
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,100
yeah have you have you had good good

380
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,410
experiences with with having agents and

381
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,390
managers in the past being an online you

382
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,240
know concentrator yeah my experience is

383
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:02,130
pretty limited I've only had one agency

384
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,580
that I've worked with and so technically

385
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,320
one agent / manager but other than that

386
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,710
it's pretty I don't even do that much

387
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,880
like sponsored stuff or any crazy

388
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:15,420
extracurricular like outside of the

389
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,770
video stuff so I haven't really had too

390
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,770
notable of an experience does that mean

391
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:22,380
that the gear that you receive to review

392
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:25,680
are they are they just sending it to

393
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,030
your is it are you buying them a little

394
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,300
bit of both mostly really that's

395
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,280
probably so it depends on what kind of

396
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,950
gear the the stuff I'm reviewing like

397
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,910
the smartphones the the headphones the

398
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:41,370
gadgets that's probably like 80% sent to

399
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,750
me 20% and bought but it's gonna end up

400
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,490
in the video no matter what if they

401
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,960
don't send it I'll buy it but all the

402
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,730
other stuff people think I also get for

403
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,440
free like the cameras we use and the

404
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,720
studio lighting and the equipment and

405
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,800
the space like that's obviously all we

406
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,080
pay for it but yeah the the smartphones

407
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,490
are the main thing that sort of has it

408
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,290
down to a science now where they like

409
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,120
have a release date they'll send it out

410
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,270
to a bunch of press and some youtubers

411
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,070
five days before the release date and we

412
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,480
all get to use it and review it and then

413
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,190
by the time the release stage shows up

414
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,610
then our videos are all ready to go so I

415
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,980
see yeah that must be in a great feeling

416
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,170
to get something before like the rest of

417
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,060
the world does yeah like do you still

418
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,710
find enjoyment in that because like it

419
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,390
seems like you get every single phone

420
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,180
that ever exists or has ever created

421
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,880
yeah and your

422
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,590
you know it's like do you feel that like

423
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,450
Christmas feeling like I get to open a

424
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,450
new new thing it's still kind of a dream

425
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,920
job yeah I feels like when I go back to

426
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,330
the studio tomorrow there's gonna be a

427
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,860
bunch of boxes waiting for me and I'm

428
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,260
just pumped to open them like it's

429
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,320
Christmas every time sometimes it's

430
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,270
because I don't have a public like a p.o

431
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,330
box or anything for like anyone to send

432
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:53,240
stuff to so every time a package arrives

433
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,850
I like kind of know what it is but

434
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,140
sometimes it's like oh this agency has

435
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,670
my address they've sent me stuff in the

436
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,530
past this is from them but I don't know

437
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,840
what it is it's probably related to

438
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,970
something else like I can sort of piece

439
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,690
it together but it's usually pretty

440
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,920
sweet to just open gadgets time yeah

441
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,900
what do you do with all the other ones

442
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,180
you don't you other bad ones

443
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,850
I can either sell them give them away

444
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,560
give them back it would depend on what

445
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,110
it is I also some people out of old

446
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,400
giant storage somewhere it's not

447
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,260
actually that bad because a lot of

448
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,360
gadgets are pretty small and I'll either

449
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,780
throw away the box and then like give

450
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,880
away or ship back the item but I keep

451
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,710
like about two generations old of

452
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,110
smartphones from like every single maker

453
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:38,600
so I just have like a it's like a drawer

454
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:45,590
literally full of I have a CD rack and I

455
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:47,600
don't have CDs the only way yeah it's

456
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,430
like having shoes but it's phones I mean

457
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,010
how many phones do you have I can

458
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,600
imagine you have a ton Hey the drawer is

459
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,830
getting so heavy that I'm kind of

460
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,870
worried that if I open it all the way

461
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,610
it'll just snap off I think there's

462
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,220
about a hundred something phones in

463
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,980
there but I don't know how many phones

464
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,620
do you use though currently two two I

465
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,709
always have my main Android phone and my

466
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,930
iPhone and my main phone is my main SIM

467
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,760
card I have two SIM cards two which is

468
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,830
kind of annoying but my main number and

469
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,410
then like my iPhone number and that's

470
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:22,040
what I carry yeah so do you say your

471
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:25,880
androids your main because if I put my

472
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,580
sim card in the iPhone notoriously

473
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,180
iMessage will just start to like take

474
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,670
over that SIM cards messages okay and

475
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,370
ecosystem lock in is also very real and

476
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,770
I've been part of my job is to be to

477
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:43,220
have a foot in like both ecosystems and

478
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:45,440
constantly be using both so I yeah I'll

479
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,910
have like my main phone will be sort of

480
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,440
rotating between phones I'm testing

481
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,450
which right now I have the pixel four

482
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,760
before that it was the one plus seven

483
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,070
Pro I was just testing a Xiaomi me note

484
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,660
10 and there's just a long line of

485
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,790
phones before that but my other phone is

486
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,550
has been the iPhone 11 Pro for a couple

487
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:06,430
months so you're you're are you so would

488
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:09,200
you if you have to choose between oh boy

489
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,480
yeah at the moment let's just say at the

490
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,370
moment the current time right now yeah

491
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,740
which one would you choose if he had to

492
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,080
choose if you had to only use one phone

493
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,840
if I had only use one phone that I would

494
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,890
use the 1 plus 7 Pro Wow and that's an

495
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,590
Android phone and not a lot of people

496
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,360
even have heard about but I love the

497
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,340
performance it has an awesome high

498
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,590
refresh rate screen the camera is not

499
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,600
that great but a lot of the reasons

500
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,500
people use the iPhone are great about

501
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,170
that phone too

502
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,510
so I could do without like the iPhone or

503
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,860
the pixel if I just had to use one but

504
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:44,510
luckily I don't have to use one so I

505
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:48,740
don't did you at any point love Apple

506
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:56,510
more than Android in some worlds yes not

507
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:59,750
even in the video editing world I was a

508
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:02,330
premiere person for like 7 years or

509
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:06,610
something and I finally got convinced to

510
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:10,160
try Final Cut Pro and loved it so for my

511
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:13,250
computer I've been a Mac for like four

512
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,870
or five straight years and not even

513
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,370
close to switching back to a Windows

514
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,080
desktop I will probably be on a Mac as

515
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,430
long as I use Final Cut well I have to

516
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,170
be on a Mac as long as it's so

517
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,780
interesting so many people including us

518
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:26,150
we'd switched from Final Cut to premiere

519
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,340
right what do you like so much better

520
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,930
about Final Cut okay so a lot of people

521
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,450
switched cuz you were using Final Cut

522
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,760
like probably in like row eight or nine

523
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,410
I don't know and it went through this

524
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,720
like transition where it got like worse

525
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,820
like simpler and a lot of people dropped

526
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,480
it right around then that's when I was

527
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,100
on premiere

528
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,090
so I saw all that dropping and happening

529
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,250
and I was like I don't really care

530
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:48,050
whatever and then it was actually the

531
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,960
Kobe interview that I was doing with

532
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,310
another youtuber John TLD and he was

533
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,330
shooting the behind the scenes video so

534
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,369
we are literally like

535
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,350
next to each other both editing our

536
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:59,539
videos me the interview him the behind

537
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,539
the scenes we both finished editing

538
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:04,639
around the same time I hit export in

539
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:08,179
premiere he had export and final cut his

540
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:10,039
video finished upload exporting he

541
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:12,529
watched him back found a mistake went

542
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:15,259
back fixed it finished exporting again

543
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:17,690
before he uploaded it I was out like 19%

544
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:20,539
we went out to dinner came back it was

545
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,369
that like 70% it eventually finished the

546
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:24,379
fans are cranking I finally get to

547
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:26,090
upload the video but that was when I was

548
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:27,559
convinced I should at least try final

549
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,619
cut because this isn't hilarious you

550
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,659
can't edit on my laptop you're the same

551
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:35,480
laptops

552
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:38,330
yeah well the footage so when you edit

553
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,309
like regular ProRes for K it's actually

554
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,909
yeah it'll it'll handle it pretty well

555
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:46,129
but I've been editing this is a multicam

556
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:49,580
red project so this is three red raw

557
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:51,619
streams of 6k at the time that I was

558
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,970
trying to push through a laptop and it

559
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:56,509
was just not handling it well

560
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:59,450
I traveled here with an iMac Pro because

561
00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:03,139
it's still really hard to edit red raw

562
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,820
on a laptop I could get away with it if

563
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:07,220
I was just shooting on like my Canon or

564
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,499
whatever but that's been my challenges

565
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,080
raw do you feel like it's difficult

566
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:14,869
because you are known for tech I mean

567
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,580
that's what you're known for if you feel

568
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:18,470
that pressure of always having to stay

569
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,379
at the top of your game quality wise and

570
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,570
I mean you do have to people look to you

571
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:25,789
right you're the guy so do you feel that

572
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,590
pressure like man I can't stoop down to

573
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:29,359
a lower quality and someone else or like

574
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,730
this is so much more work but I have to

575
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,679
use the red yeah I I don't look at his

576
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,960
pressure as much as I actually want to

577
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,629
push the game to the next level right I

578
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,960
would love if red made like a smaller

579
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:43,399
camera with like the same color science

580
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,480
and autofocus and I could take that

581
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:47,600
places because it would make my life

582
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,129
easier but when I watch back I've tried

583
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,629
this I've gone to events with like just

584
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:55,279
my rx100 or ESR or whatever and I edit

585
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:57,080
all the footage and I'm like I don't

586
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,600
like this as much this isn't as good

587
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,240
looking so something about my eye for it

588
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,119
is like the main reason why I want to

589
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,619
bring like the nice camera and deal with

590
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,359
the extra work yeah it's cuz you

591
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:10,970
genuinely just want to do something

592
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,159
better yeah okay so do you have like a

593
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,749
team that helps you because I know you

594
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:16,249
answer emails yourself but yeah what

595
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:18,799
does your team look like yes so I have

596
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:20,960
three people working with me Andrews my

597
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,340
full-time assistant and sort of like a

598
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,200
second pair of hands but he also

599
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,529
co-hosts the podcast and edits it and

600
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,830
then VIN and Brandon are the sort of

601
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:32,029
cinematography extra hands and they're

602
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,009
super talented in their own right but

603
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:36,049
they'll do things like their behind the

604
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:38,029
camera when I'm on camera they do set

605
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:40,190
design they do motion graphics sound

606
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:42,019
design all that stuff so when I do like

607
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,929
the main edit I can pass off clips to

608
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:46,220
them they can make that clip incredible

609
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:47,749
and we bring it back in and we'll do

610
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,879
like a robot shot is what we call it

611
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:51,740
bring that back in and we sort of mix it

612
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:53,840
all together and then I'll finish the

613
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,259
whole project she's still very hands-on

614
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,269
in your process then definitely yeah and

615
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:01,070
I sort of not struggled with that but

616
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:02,990
I've thought a lot about like what if I

617
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,999
just gave them the whole edit and we've

618
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,879
we tried that actually a couple times

619
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:10,249
and every time we do that it feels great

620
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:14,470
to not have to work as much because

621
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:17,570
they're editing but I feel like the the

622
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,700
personal touch is lobby's you have to go

623
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,039
back in and change it's gonna take a lot

624
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,080
of time anyway yeah little things and I

625
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:26,629
you know over time I'm sure we could

626
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,669
like hone that down for them to to

627
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:30,320
pretty much edit it exactly the way I

628
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:33,740
would but it definitely feels like I

629
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,450
should just keep doing the main edit and

630
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,429
if you're not I mean you say you still

631
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,799
get excited by it so it's not like yet a

632
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:42,200
chore right yeah no I I know that the

633
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:45,019
Edit is the most tedious part yeah but

634
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,029
it is the most personal like execution

635
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:48,499
and I think I think that's a similar

636
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:51,489
situation you and Greg have to go

637
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:56,679
through right yeah yeah we still do that

638
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:59,629
I've had to learn to I guess kind of I

639
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:02,119
was I was a lot worse I mean not Alan if

640
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:03,799
it's called worse I was very like not

641
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:05,029
perfectionist I just like things a

642
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,009
certain way and I was talking about

643
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:08,299
timing to point something of a second

644
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:10,840
you know like it makes a big difference

645
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:13,549
to me but I had to learn like okay I

646
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,529
know it bothers me but I know most

647
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:18,049
people it's not all people don't even

648
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:20,120
realize this and I've tested that theory

649
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:21,679
and it for the most part

650
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,840
I know exactly what you're talking about

651
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,330
I had to get okay with being like okay

652
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,970
this is realistically for them on time

653
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:31,669
that we have left to post this this is

654
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,320
enough yeah and it was it was it's a

655
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:35,809
tough thing to do and it hurts sometimes

656
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,890
yeah but I definitely know what you're

657
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,500
talking about have you gone back and

658
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,029
forth like you edit one and like you can

659
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,620
see how the audience reacts versus

660
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:43,220
someone else who edited a video and oh

661
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,169
for sure

662
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,029
yeah sure and it would just became a

663
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:48,950
thing of like the times that I really

664
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:52,039
care about something that's exciting and

665
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,690
new yeah then I won't like budge on it

666
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,890
yeah if it's something that I'm like not

667
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,880
that proud of that sounds bad I'm not

668
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,880
proud of stuff and then it's just like

669
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,190
well I this is enough you know what they

670
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,350
say to do like one for you one for them

671
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,090
that's like a general rule but like you

672
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,240
can sort of go back and forth where like

673
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,980
some things are just you know we already

674
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,990
kind of have a basic idea of what this

675
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,490
is gonna be and so we can easily pass

676
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:19,100
that off and then some of them are like

677
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,539
like more passion projects or whatever

678
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,710
gonna call it and then you end up I mean

679
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:24,470
I recently liked one that you did a

680
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,789
video you made that didn't I didn't know

681
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,250
you did that kind of video there wasn't

682
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:29,570
a review it was just you um I don't

683
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,520
remember what exactly do I think you

684
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:36,919
just exported the same video like over

685
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,510
and over I like this one I want to do

686
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,460
more of that I think you should do I

687
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:42,500
like that video how did that do for you

688
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,419
though it was fine actually updated well

689
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,429
I think it's because it ended up like a

690
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:47,929
fun video right I think the initial

691
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:49,490
performance of it was probably worse

692
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,799
because people are all used to like new

693
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,380
gadget new gadget tech new thing and

694
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,000
then what happens when you download and

695
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,010
read upload a video a thousand times or

696
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,750
like I don't know I guess I'll watch

697
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,250
that later but once people watched it

698
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,590
and start sharing it people like really

699
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,590
liked it I am I am the reason why I

700
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:11,059
thought that was great so you actually

701
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:12,409
did that then yeah I'm bloated yes so

702
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:15,080
Egypt I was like the download button

703
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:18,080
inside of it so we uploaded this 8k

704
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,570
beautiful like 40 second file downloaded

705
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,179
it and then uploaded that and they

706
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,490
downloaded that and uploaded that and we

707
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:27,529
did that a thousand times so what was

708
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:31,250
your internet bill like some people web

709
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:32,760
cap I'm like a fiber it was since it was

710
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,760
such a short file it wasn't so

711
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,990
it was more of like the tedious someone

712
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,340
every all the comments are like why

713
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,050
didn't you just write a script to do it

714
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:44,550
which we were like oh I didn't know I

715
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:47,250
could yeah it turns out there's a limit

716
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:48,780
of like a hundred uploads a day and so

717
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,580
once you get to that limit you have to

718
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,290
like wait 24 hours to start again so

719
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:56,280
that's at least 10 days of 100 uploads

720
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:57,870
but then some of them it was Andrew and

721
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,550
VIN and I all trying to do this but like

722
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,620
if you download a video and then upload

723
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:03,300
it and then download that too fast it

724
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,130
was like not done processing so you

725
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,570
didn't get the full quality and then if

726
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,100
you like didn't really check them for

727
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,870
like 50 and then you like look at it

728
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,340
you're like why is this 480p and you go

729
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,640
back 50 and you realize you messed up

730
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:17,180
you you lose those 50 towards the castle

731
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,580
is like a month project yeah exactly

732
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:22,620
worth it I thought that was one of the

733
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,720
best videos I've seen a long is good it

734
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,670
was just creative what do you use for

735
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,590
your camera to shoot with or do you

736
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:32,040
change it once in a while or yeah our

737
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:34,860
our main camera is a monster Oh 8k this

738
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:38,280
division direct their names are pretty

739
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:40,920
weird now but it's a red camera and it's

740
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,350
a huge nearly full-frame sensor which is

741
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,390
wild for video and then the image

742
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,450
processing pipeline just spits out a que

743
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,950
red raw with like 16 stops of dynamic

744
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,500
range or something crazy I could no

745
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,610
doubt about it forever but it's a that's

746
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,870
the primary camera

747
00:27:53,610 --> 00:28:00,690
well no autofocus huge file size is kind

748
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,820
of terrible to use but the image is so

749
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,980
nice that I'm willing to work with it

750
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,690
and and sort of that I have that

751
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,750
pipeline pretty much down I mean for a

752
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:12,240
YouTube video like you may be using

753
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:15,570
probably the best camera out of any

754
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,670
youtuber right that's not shooting film

755
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,250
right yeah it's kind of funny it's like

756
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:23,070
I know another guy John who uses an Ari

757
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,630
Alexa mini one my friend Judd nur who's

758
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,850
also from New Jersey also uses a red

759
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,430
camera and it's something about the tech

760
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,660
crowd and maybe this is just because

761
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,700
we've been leading the way and a lot of

762
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,900
people are sort of copying it but for

763
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,210
whatever reason we just really like

764
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,120
crispy video and the better you can make

765
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,160
it out it's kind of funny you've noticed

766
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,430
like if you watch a bunch of other tech

767
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,360
videos even from like CNET or The Wall

768
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,659
Street Journal yep

769
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,099
suddenly all their videos

770
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:49,840
really cinematic in the past couple

771
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:52,960
years and that's because that's just the

772
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,009
look that's over kind of set this bar I

773
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,570
mean that's kind of like what you're

774
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:58,119
known for it to a certain degree right

775
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,710
like yes so I never really thought about

776
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:01,269
taking credit for it cuz there's sort of

777
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,739
a group of us that are all sort of

778
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:04,659
pushing the envelope and doing different

779
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:08,039
things but like if I see a robot shot

780
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:10,989
from one of them yeah I start right yeah

781
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:12,369
yeah uh you said there's a small group

782
00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:14,080
if you guys that do that yeah do you

783
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:16,419
guys have like a group chat where you

784
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,299
discuss all do you try to this this like

785
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:21,820
exchanging tricks and trades yeah we not

786
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,590
a group chat but we all sort of it's

787
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,080
kind of funny at tech events because

788
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:28,179
like tech companies invite all the same

789
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,759
people to all their events we sort of

790
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:32,499
all collaborate and we'll chat at these

791
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,960
things so like CES every year we're all

792
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:36,369
there but like when Samsung comes out

793
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,109
with a new phone they invite all of us

794
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:39,609
so we're all there anyway so we all

795
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,109
talked there and then we're all at the

796
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:42,729
Apple event we all talk there and a

797
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:45,129
Motorola and like it just sort of

798
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:47,080
happens a lot during the year um but

799
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:49,779
yeah that's when we'll end up like just

800
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,190
talking about the techie Tube world or

801
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:52,929
do you feel like sometimes because

802
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,309
you're always hanging out together when

803
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:57,460
you guys talk about things sometimes

804
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:59,619
their opinions influence you so almost

805
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,389
like it bleeds into your commentary

806
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:05,529
probably yeah and I think even just

807
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:07,149
watching other videos like I know my my

808
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:08,830
edit style has changed watching other

809
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:11,229
people's videos like what you say about

810
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,849
like a point ii like 0.1 second

811
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:15,999
difference like if you watch a philip

812
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:17,979
defranco video you would know if the

813
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:20,049
Edit style changed because like the

814
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:21,580
cadence would be off right and i don't

815
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:24,279
know how many people would notice if my

816
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:26,080
edit was a quarter of a second off but

817
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:28,629
like that's the sort of thing i'll like

818
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,460
sort of hone based on like watching my

819
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:32,320
own in other people's videos and i think

820
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:36,669
that happens in a lot of things and in

821
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:39,039
tech and other genres too yeah well

822
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:40,599
we're about at that halfway mark okay

823
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,529
cool i guess we'll do a quick

824
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:46,059
shishi break and this is something we

825
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:47,710
just started doing since yesterday but

826
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,119
do you have any things for our halftime

827
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,169
show that you want to perform any skills

828
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,629
anything you can do

829
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:55,089
can you sing I will drink more of this

830
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:56,790
water and do a bottle flip do it right

831
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:59,290
now but it's gonna take a while okay

832
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:01,660
[Music]

833
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,980
you actually have to do it yeah I don't

834
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:16,570
even have any crazy yeah

835
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:19,960
well then we'll be right back and we're

836
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,850
back sweet awesome so I wanted to ask

837
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,270
you something about this cuz you know

838
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:27,730
you're definitely a tech channel have

839
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:30,130
you seen how like the youtubes Peace

840
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:33,220
Corps recently got leaked kind of I did

841
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:35,260
see that I don't think I saw myself in

842
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,210
that but I saw the articles but yeah and

843
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,610
I was like definitely pushing tech and

844
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,400
gaming and stuff like that yeah is it

845
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,630
explicitly pushing tech uh it talked

846
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,090
about that because that's like a great

847
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,730
consumer it's really that you can buy a

848
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:51,070
lot of right ad companies will probably

849
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,050
purchase into that area as well yeah uh

850
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,970
and so I was just curious how if you

851
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:56,980
felt like oh like this is good for us or

852
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,320
I feel like I've always sort of known

853
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,600
that what we're in one of these genres

854
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,860
that's like pretty clean for YouTube

855
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,570
like I know a lot of people like the ad

856
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,550
pocalypse happens like a lot of certain

857
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:09,100
genres of channels were like really

858
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,630
struggling to deal with it and if you

859
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,420
watch any of my videos or any tech

860
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:17,050
videos basically they're all pretty much

861
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,490
like clean the the normal demographic is

862
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,200
awesome for YouTube because it's like

863
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,810
people who are unreachable anywhere else

864
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,390
it's like 18 to 34 year old affluent

865
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:27,700
spending you know consumers that are

866
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,560
like ready they like like put our ad

867
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,270
dollars right there like it's perfect so

868
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,880
like I've always kind of known that's

869
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:35,530
it's a good safe place on YouTube and

870
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,450
it's kind of a happy coincidence that I

871
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,970
happen to love tech but yeah it's been

872
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,190
pretty smooth sailing as far as dealing

873
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,600
with YouTube so how do you um do you

874
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,700
guys have to like look at algorithms

875
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,380
constantly that's your thing are you

876
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,970
kind of just like oh no we're clean so

877
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,850
we know we're gonna be good yeah there's

878
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,350
still ways to play with algorithm

879
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,210
especially in the whole quantity over

880
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,430
quality game I think about that a lot

881
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:59,800
and we make about a hundred videos a

882
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:01,150
year which is like one every three days

883
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,550
like twice a week something like that

884
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:05,830
and I know for a fact because other

885
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:08,500
channels do this if I uploaded daily the

886
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:11,500
channel would do massively better on

887
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,669
paper it would get three times as many

888
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,039
views every month they

889
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:17,049
would get recommended in the algorithm

890
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,989
there would be a bigger category a

891
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:23,470
bigger library of things to recommend

892
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:25,720
but as far as sanity I don't think I can

893
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,399
like do that to myself so yeah we think

894
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,359
about the algorithm a little bit but

895
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:33,940
generally a title thumbnail in the

896
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,669
description make a great video yeah yeah

897
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,200
and uh just went with terminology I

898
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:39,759
forgot for audiences who don't know he's

899
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,340
like YouTube's P scores basically like

900
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,899
their preferential score what type of

901
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,639
videos they'll suggest you and your

902
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:49,239
recommended in your sidebar stuff like

903
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:52,389
that and as of a couple of days ago I

904
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:54,519
don't have you seen YouTube's new UI in

905
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:56,799
terms of uploading stuff like that not

906
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,629
uploading I saw the new homepage mm

907
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,049
which is like much bigger thumbnails

908
00:33:58,629 --> 00:34:04,749
which I don't hate because I've our

909
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:07,269
thumbnails are like kind of like made to

910
00:34:04,749 --> 00:34:08,710
be really tiny like it when I do a

911
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:10,450
thumbnail of like a phone like there's

912
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,649
only so many angles you can show a phone

913
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,480
where if you shrink it down to that

914
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:15,040
postage stamp-sized you can even tell

915
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,599
what it is so I kind of like the bigger

916
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,690
thumbnails but the new upload interface

917
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:20,950
I haven't seen so what do you do when

918
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,540
you're not making youtube videos I think

919
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:24,309
a lot of people are pretty interested in

920
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,460
knowing what your life is like outside

921
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:29,139
of that to have like a girlfriend you

922
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,030
just hang out with your friends like or

923
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:33,520
is it just work work work and frisbee

924
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:37,059
frisbee yeah well I was gonna say is

925
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,099
like usually if I'm not at work it's

926
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:41,079
some ultimate related thing like

927
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:44,889
weekends for the most part on the East

928
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:47,710
Coast when it's warm from like March

929
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:50,079
when is getting warm to like September

930
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,929
which is Nationals is Ultimate Frisbee

931
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,429
which is it's a lot because you have

932
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,260
practice during the week and then you

933
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:58,150
have games and tournaments on weekends

934
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:01,180
but that's mostly what I'm doing when

935
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,319
I'm not at work and that's like mainly

936
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,970
the reason I'm I wouldn't I would go

937
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:05,980
insane if I didn't have some sort of

938
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:08,260
especially cuz like when you're a

939
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,910
youtuber people know nothing about this

940
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,400
but you're like sitting down all day and

941
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,839
like I can't really sit down for more

942
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,520
than about three or four hours like I

943
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,049
hate cross-country flights because I

944
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,319
really just don't want to be sitting for

945
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:22,569
that long so something about like I can

946
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:24,369
get through sitting and editing for five

947
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:25,330
straight hours because I know you have

948
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:28,330
practice tonight like

949
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:29,590
we'll be the opposite Wars exactly like

950
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,660
chomping at the bit trying to get out of

951
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:34,090
that so I think that's like the the

952
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,700
balance of when I don't have to work

953
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,110
that's that's where I'm at what is a so

954
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,660
you said it's like games and tournaments

955
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:43,210
is it mostly tournament based your

956
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,430
season or how does because I've no no

957
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,880
idea yeah yeah yeah it's kind of complex

958
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:51,310
and anytime I try to explain it I try to

959
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,900
simplify it basically Club ultimate

960
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:55,330
which is like if you think of like club

961
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,460
soccer like area teams are that's like

962
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,560
the main version of ultimate college

963
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,180
kids will join an area team people who

964
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,040
are graduating things like that I play

965
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,620
for the New Jersey area team now I play

966
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,250
for the New York area team and those are

967
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:11,950
all it's a better team yeah we came in

968
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,540
30 Nationals Dan OH Congrats thank you

969
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:16,240
that just happened to you said September

970
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,350
yeah that was was it a month ago maybe

971
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,050
he's a month ago no I don't how many

972
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:24,100
teams because Nationals I think there

973
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:26,410
were 16 teams well and is it also kind

974
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:30,700
of like other sports we have to travel

975
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:32,920
to another city to play yes yeah so so

976
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:35,860
yeah tournaments will be in various

977
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,380
cities around the u.s. so we had a

978
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:41,050
tournament in Colorado this year

979
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,570
Nationals is in San Diego there's other

980
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:46,270
tournaments on both coasts generally but

981
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:48,520
anywhere you get like a huge field space

982
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:51,310
that's like generally like Minnesota and

983
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,650
is really popular with fields and and

984
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,700
certain states have much more fields

985
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,020
than others but it's tournament

986
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,140
basically you play like four games in a

987
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,910
day and hopefully you win but that's

988
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,890
your like your stress relief and

989
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:06,730
something you love doing yeah definitely

990
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:09,520
would you say that I guess let's say the

991
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,170
Ultimate Frisbee became the thing like

992
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,810
it became like the next big thing right

993
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,460
well would you leave the tech industry

994
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,300
and would you do that professionally if

995
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,100
it paid off

996
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,990
paid away more than you know let's say

997
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,970
you got a 20 million dollar contract to

998
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,440
be a frisbee player but you got to focus

999
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,040
on playing frisbee can't make tech

1000
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:32,080
videos anymore

1001
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:33,550
you could do it LeBron vlogging yeah

1002
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,670
your new hate comments be like dog get

1003
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:39,240
back to the field

1004
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:41,819
get that disk going dang uh Wow I I

1005
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,530
assume it's your stress relief right yes

1006
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:47,250
they don't want compact this they want

1007
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,609
frisbee this exactly uh I never thought

1008
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,240
about that

1009
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:51,900
I guess yeah I guess I would you would

1010
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,030
enjoy it more

1011
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:57,510
I would enjoy it but I think yeah my

1012
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:59,490
offseason yeah like you know some sort

1013
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:02,400
of creative outlet cuz I think I would

1014
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:04,829
also go crazy right now if I never had

1015
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,750
any creative outlet so I think they sort

1016
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:09,150
of you know each other they keep each

1017
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,980
other like in check or from overwhelming

1018
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,349
the other do you find that your fan base

1019
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,640
cuz allow your stuff is educational so

1020
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:17,460
like if someone's interest in something

1021
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,049
I would assume they type in something

1022
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,040
and they find you and they what they

1023
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:22,349
learn and they'd like you or they don't

1024
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,569
and they trust you or whatever do you

1025
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:25,859
find that your fans would care care more

1026
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:30,000
about you or care more about your

1027
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:32,910
content I think the content but I think

1028
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,760
it helps to have a palatable personality

1029
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:37,530
yeah I think there's a bunch of really

1030
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,150
good examples of channels that are

1031
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:41,010
successful because of their personality

1032
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,750
and like the audience is there for them

1033
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:45,869
right and oh they're so relatable

1034
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:48,599
they're so funny they're so whatever and

1035
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:51,089
I think I sort of mentioned earlier but

1036
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,460
like the best the easiest part of my job

1037
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:56,130
is like I don't have to be the most

1038
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,390
entertaining person personally I'm like

1039
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,400
covering the tech and that's what people

1040
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,980
care about and hopefully my coverage of

1041
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,359
the tech is also entertaining and that's

1042
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,220
where we push the limits of like well

1043
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,530
that's why you have fans because they

1044
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,240
like you doing it right just some random

1045
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,190
person ever eat every week or every

1046
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,569
three days doing it right yeah yeah

1047
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,190
there's a million places to get do you

1048
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:15,450
think I mean I don't know if you have or

1049
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,460
not but don't you think what if you did

1050
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,839
something about you playing professional

1051
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,250
frisbee you think they would care about

1052
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,049
you or do you think they would not like

1053
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,420
that because like what is this yeah I

1054
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:26,460
think I have wanted to do that and I'm I

1055
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,670
struggle to find the time to really give

1056
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,369
it the time it deserves I think any time

1057
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:34,799
we're playing I'm so that's the problem

1058
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:36,510
I'm so hyper focused on playing that I

1059
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:37,890
would be like annoyed that I couldn't

1060
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:41,040
give my attention to how it was being

1061
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,869
recorded filmed I'd have to honestly

1062
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,490
like take a season where I'm injured or

1063
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:46,710
something so I'm up I don't like to not

1064
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,510
I'm not like worked like mad that I'm

1065
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,570
not playing because I couldn't play so I

1066
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,520
could focus on recording

1067
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:54,640
but like usually the entire season I'm

1068
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,960
like focused on like peaking physically

1069
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,730
at the right time of year and like

1070
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,560
eating right and like oh like everything

1071
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:02,080
I'm doing on the field is like for very

1072
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,970
purpose built so like it's really hard

1073
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,220
to make something about that yeah yeah

1074
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,440
using other people's footage so yeah

1075
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,850
with yeah I know what you mean yeah I

1076
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,050
would I would like to do that though and

1077
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:13,540
you'd have to like get people to sign

1078
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:16,990
like release forms exactly

1079
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:19,630
but on the off season though what do you

1080
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:22,300
do that's sure right now is the off

1081
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:25,630
season it's a lot of just like working

1082
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:29,380
out boring staring at a wall biking like

1083
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:31,150
it's it's not as exciting we do have

1084
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,120
like some winter leagues that you can

1085
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:37,840
play in in New Jersey which is a lot of

1086
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:40,000
like weekday night stuff randomly but I

1087
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,500
do enjoy like having random time I I

1088
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,840
took a day the other day and I just

1089
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,910
played 2k for like I think the entire

1090
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:49,360
day because it sunsets at like 4 o'clock

1091
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:51,850
and I think from like from like 10 a.m.

1092
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,710
to like 4 o'clock I just played 2k 2

1093
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,750
whole day cuz I hadn't gotten 2k 20 yet

1094
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:59,200
so I had to like get in get in the

1095
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:01,030
storyline yeah yeah I usually get 2k

1096
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,760
every year like right when it comes out

1097
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:05,740
same and this year I slacked a little

1098
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,250
bit and I didn't get to it until after

1099
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,590
nationals

1100
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,780
mm-hm and so I just got into it I got a

1101
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:12,460
question I mean a shift modes a little

1102
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,900
bit get a little more deep sure go ahead

1103
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,180
what like so you know you're obviously

1104
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:19,540
very very successful you've interviewed

1105
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:22,720
some of the leaders of the world right

1106
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:24,880
in technology and science and you've

1107
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,190
been you know Oliver on every

1108
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,570
publication and whatnot and you're

1109
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,060
you're doing this thing that you really

1110
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,770
enjoy right what what is what's driving

1111
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,160
that like what is it like you do have

1112
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:38,860
like a purpose or like a reason for

1113
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,600
doing this I know it's very deep but but

1114
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,430
I'm curious because you know that it's

1115
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,440
obvious that a lot of people are super

1116
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:46,300
drawn to your personality right even

1117
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,740
though it may be something that's you're

1118
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:55,860
just reviewing products right something

1119
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:58,240
technical technology but but you know

1120
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:00,670
seems like you had a really good

1121
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,780
upbringing and you seem like a very you

1122
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,730
know likeable

1123
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,920
and I'm just wondering like what is

1124
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,970
driving you to like what's your end goal

1125
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,250
like what are you trying to accomplish

1126
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:10,510
just I know it's not just you know

1127
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,890
you're not just trying to review

1128
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:14,560
products like there's yeah there must be

1129
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:17,800
something there I think the the way it

1130
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,480
all started was I wanted to make videos

1131
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,120
that I would want to watch so it sort of

1132
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,980
it was like created from I wanted to

1133
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:27,760
create something that I wanted to exist

1134
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:30,220
in the world and I sort of started to

1135
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,020
pivot it but stopped because it was way

1136
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:37,060
too much into creating like a website

1137
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,650
where you could just like look up a

1138
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,000
product and just like see if you should

1139
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,980
buy it or not and I whether that was a

1140
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,810
video or like some collection of videos

1141
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,090
or some information or comparison or

1142
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:48,970
whatever it was you could just find it

1143
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:50,950
decide if you wanted to buy or not and I

1144
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,870
think like the videos that I make are

1145
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:55,840
like kind of the next best thing it's

1146
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:57,400
like I think of a product I wonder if

1147
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,650
it's any good I'm just curious about it

1148
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,150
generally or some topic I wonder what

1149
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,940
happens when I upload a thousand times

1150
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,520
and download it upload it again and I'll

1151
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:09,220
just go search it up find it and boom up

1152
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,470
here's the best possible comprehensive

1153
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,870
video about what I wanted to see that's

1154
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,070
just kind of basically what it's based

1155
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,950
around you know it's I guess it's

1156
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:21,040
nothing too deep as far as like what is

1157
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:22,630
my purpose what I what I want to do with

1158
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,880
his time I feel like it's it's mainly

1159
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:27,340
just creating what I want to exist and

1160
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,530
making it better as we go it seems like

1161
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,970
you're on a quest the way I see it at

1162
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:34,210
least from this explanation just love it

1163
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:38,140
I see it as a quest to create the best

1164
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:42,730
library of reviews for any particular

1165
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:44,320
phone or you know gadgets yeah yeah yeah

1166
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,330
it kind of has end up ended up being

1167
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,570
that and I think the like branching out

1168
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:53,410
into other types of videos is the more

1169
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:56,200
fun part that I want to do more and so

1170
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:58,600
maybe it's less of a catalog of products

1171
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,450
and more of a catalog of entertainment

1172
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,250
but tech happens to be the common thread

1173
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:05,500
that goes through it we're doing a retro

1174
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,300
tech series that starts premiering in

1175
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,800
December or it's like obviously no one's

1176
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,880
buying these products anymore they're

1177
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,250
all gonna be you know 20 30 40 year-old

1178
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,810
iconic pieces of tech but it's like the

1179
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,100
Aryans of diving back into what made

1180
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,470
them iconic it's just sort of

1181
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:23,050
entertainment instead of like product

1182
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:25,780
based stuff yeah so yeah it's just a

1183
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,160
lesson in history yeah yeah exactly and

1184
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,720
still tech related some people aren't

1185
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,130
good don't give you the past it's not

1186
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,700
your usual stuff but it's still related

1187
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:36,010
yeah common thread right yeah so we do

1188
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,670
have some questions from fans here oh

1189
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,470
boy

1190
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:41,250
many many questions yeah I got a

1191
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:44,800
question first okay for that I love it

1192
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:48,910
because like you said I like what you

1193
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,890
said palatable personality sure what is

1194
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:52,990
the weirdest band interaction you've had

1195
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:54,640
though we're just fan interaction

1196
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,870
because I'm sure you're so likable that

1197
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,010
they just come up and they're like I

1198
00:44:55,870 --> 00:45:00,730
know you

1199
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:02,880
I'm just right into it you're right that

1200
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:05,440
like when people come up to me they they

1201
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,030
it's a it's a power a social

1202
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,260
relationship everyone knows everything

1203
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,930
already about you and you don't really

1204
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:15,220
know them so it's kind of one-sided at

1205
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:17,440
first but on one hand that actually does

1206
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:20,260
produce a lot of like fun like

1207
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,720
interactions I on my way here as I was

1208
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,760
getting into the uber lady walking by

1209
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,410
didn't even like do anything she just

1210
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,090
walked by and went I really liked your

1211
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:35,230
YouTube videos and then just kept

1212
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:39,340
walking I was nice but yeah weird

1213
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:40,630
weirdest fan interactions I'm trying to

1214
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,820
think of like because I'm sure you have

1215
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,860
to be at a lot of conventions stuff like

1216
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:49,210
yeah well here's the thing about a tech

1217
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:51,880
audience is a lot of nerds like me don't

1218
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:54,190
go out too much or whatever so when we

1219
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,310
get to like a tech convention imagine

1220
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:59,710
filling a hall with all these people who

1221
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:01,060
like are used to being like just on the

1222
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:04,570
computer and now they're just sort of

1223
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:06,190
checking out tech so it's sort of a like

1224
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,660
everyone that comes up to me will have

1225
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,190
like a different way of trying to

1226
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,620
explain that they know who I am but it's

1227
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:16,500
usually pretty awkward it'll be either

1228
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:19,240
like oh my daughter knows who you are

1229
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,530
YouTube right or they'll like say 410

1230
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,680
they don't know I like I like the

1231
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,640
everyone says in the acronym wrong I was

1232
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,500
walking through the airport and someone

1233
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,240
said mkb D or something like they just

1234
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,410
said the

1235
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,010
letters and I was like yeah that's me

1236
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:33,360
not really but yeah everyone's got a

1237
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:36,270
different way I noticed stuff like just

1238
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:38,490
saying nothing too crazy nothing yeah

1239
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:40,380
nothing like no crazy I don't want to

1240
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,030
like jinx it but nothing like stalkerish

1241
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,340
or anything wild because your audience

1242
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:49,380
is a little more mature yeah they're all

1243
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:52,619
at home alright so we have a question

1244
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,369
here from three number three do you ever

1245
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:59,250
want to produce or create your own tech

1246
00:46:55,369 --> 00:47:01,440
yeah that's a big challenge like a big

1247
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,670
undertaking I've thought about and this

1248
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,200
is come up before like why don't you

1249
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:06,510
make yeah so much to say about phones

1250
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,950
why don't you make your own phone it's

1251
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:11,880
like well okay you need you need like a

1252
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,200
manufacturing process you need to

1253
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,220
basically partner with an entire

1254
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,260
smartphone company

1255
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,880
the thing about partnering with a

1256
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,280
smartphone company when you have to

1257
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,990
objectively review smart phones is that

1258
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,000
compromises your relationship with at

1259
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:28,590
least that company's products forever if

1260
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,050
not the rest of those products so it

1261
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:32,940
seems like that might be like an end

1262
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:34,770
game like when I'm 50 I'd be like

1263
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,000
alright I'm done making videos I'm gonna

1264
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:38,760
make the perfect phone and I'm out of

1265
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,390
here or when your professional ultimate

1266
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,150
Blair yeah I'm your sponsor yeah by your

1267
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:48,990
own bone exactly and then the logos on

1268
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:51,810
the Jersey is perfect yeah

1269
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:54,000
what this is actually Mike my question I

1270
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:58,380
you know everybody knows that you are a

1271
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,700
fan of Tesla yeah you drive a Tesla what

1272
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,560
do you think about the future of Tesla

1273
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,090
and what their automobiles like where

1274
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,750
they're headed right now like do you

1275
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,200
think they're headed in the right

1276
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,480
direction

1277
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,920
yeah whenever I look at Tesla and I

1278
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,720
compare it to I try to stay objective

1279
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,340
like I'm obviously fan of Tesla but I

1280
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,520
look around at other electric cars and

1281
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:17,340
every time I look around Tesla is miles

1282
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,670
ahead in so many ways as far as electric

1283
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:22,530
cars and I think we're just now getting

1284
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,690
to the point where there is legitimate

1285
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:26,940
competition to a couple of their models

1286
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,920
the Porsche ty can seems like one of

1287
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,720
them but it's still more of a driver's

1288
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,100
car versus the everyday like the model 3

1289
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,340
when you're out here it's everywhere

1290
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:38,150
basically so they're kind of on a great

1291
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:41,040
path i I was talking to someone recently

1292
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:43,460
about a potentially unique way for

1293
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,440
to exist which is just for them to sell

1294
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:48,690
parts like they have the gigafactory

1295
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,790
and they have such great drivetrain

1296
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:54,090
technology they could sell electric

1297
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:56,760
drivetrains cell batteries and then kind

1298
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:58,800
of like Google just sell one car like a

1299
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,330
Model S and Model 3 but still the rest

1300
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,860
of those parts to make everyone else's

1301
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:04,470
electric cars better the way Google

1302
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:06,360
license is Android mm-hmm so there's an

1303
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:09,150
Android phone from Samsung from Motorola

1304
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,100
from Huawei from Xiaomi they can all use

1305
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:13,350
that to make their phone better so they

1306
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:15,930
don't have to build their own OS because

1307
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:17,730
right now Ford doesn't really make great

1308
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:19,200
electric drivetrain Toyota doesn't I

1309
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,670
mean I have a hybrid but they don't make

1310
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,950
their own great electric drivetrain so

1311
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:24,600
if they just partnered up with Tesla and

1312
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,580
use the supercharger network they'd

1313
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,080
already have a much better car so I was

1314
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,130
thinking about it in that unique way

1315
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,650
recently and I think that could be

1316
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:34,190
pretty cool but as it right now I just

1317
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:34,190
want the Roadster

1318
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:41,040
it's supposed to be 2020 but also for

1319
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:43,590
sure delete Oh all right next question

1320
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,170
here from Joseph Liu

1321
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:55,230
what does mobile tech look like in the

1322
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:57,090
future oh man if I knew I think also I

1323
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,410
struggle with being maybe a little bit

1324
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:00,390
short-sighted because people make these

1325
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:02,270
like crazy renders of like Oh it'll be a

1326
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:05,130
hologram that comes up out of your I

1327
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:07,050
don't know maybe I just think like we'll

1328
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,880
always have like ice and smartphones as

1329
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:12,810
just like this object that you like pick

1330
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,250
up use and put away and so on when we

1331
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,900
get these like wearables and like I just

1332
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,130
broke out Google glass again for like

1333
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,990
the first time in years and I'm like

1334
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:20,370
trying to understand like maybe VR is

1335
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:23,550
the future maybe AR

1336
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:25,950
but I don't quite see it yeah and I just

1337
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:27,450
I go back to like well if we can make

1338
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:29,550
phones better that'll be the future yeah

1339
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:31,020
so uh maybe I'm sure it's sighted but I

1340
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,850
feel like I just look at smart phones

1341
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,360
the smaller phones aren't going away not

1342
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:35,880
anytime soon

1343
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:39,270
mm-hmm yeah I have a question actually

1344
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:42,390
so yeah rewind we talked a little brief

1345
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:45,780
about it but I touched on that yeah and

1346
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:47,940
I feel like you kind of got thrown into

1347
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:51,300
it yeah hard because you were like that

1348
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:54,320
first big line sure yeah did you do you

1349
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:56,300
feel the brunt of the hate yeah you

1350
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,130
almost like a face of it that's why yeah

1351
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,540
I don't know if you know it was funny

1352
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:01,760
what on the face but he was one of the

1353
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,130
biggest yeah yeah yeah it it I I don't

1354
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,050
think I got that much hate for it

1355
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:07,970
I think the memes in the comments were

1356
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:12,110
relentless for like three months

1357
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:13,730
mmm-hmm but as far as my involvement in

1358
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:16,040
it like I kind of told my story and I

1359
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,230
made a video about it but like we all

1360
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,240
thought rewind was gonna be this

1361
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,500
different thing this year I don't know

1362
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,660
if you got like that email that was like

1363
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,100
this is the first year everyone's gonna

1364
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,230
feature creator voices and we've

1365
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,750
narrowed it down to 50 creators instead

1366
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:31,340
of 350 and I was like oh this is gonna

1367
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,190
be different and then we did this shoot

1368
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,600
and in the shoot the producers are all

1369
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:37,520
telling us the same stuff like it's

1370
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,140
gonna be great we did multiple takes of

1371
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,400
different lines everyone gets a close-up

1372
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,320
shot we're like wow this is different

1373
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,110
and then you watch the video like this

1374
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,940
is not different this is the same thing

1375
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:49,120
so yeah it was like I don't feel like I

1376
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:52,100
got thrown into it as much as I just I

1377
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,690
along with everyone else involved didn't

1378
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,110
have any control over the final product

1379
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:59,180
and it just kind of happened mm-hm

1380
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:01,760
hopefully this year is better if they

1381
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:04,850
even do a rewind this is sure they will

1382
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,650
think you're doing something yeah so

1383
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:12,410
there's another question here I'm from

1384
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:14,330
hot sure whoring your reviews are now

1385
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:17,690
quoted by the biggest companies in the

1386
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:20,120
world has that kind of pressure changed

1387
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:21,890
how you approach reviews in any way and

1388
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,770
it's it's I mean I would think that you

1389
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:26,660
know when you're making these reviews

1390
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,850
some of the biggest publications may

1391
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:31,670
also quote you right I mean do you feel

1392
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:34,280
that pressure or is it just just don't

1393
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:38,300
think about that at all uh at most I

1394
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:40,220
think maybe it might like make might

1395
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:43,220
tempt me to use more quotable language

1396
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:44,930
hmm but as far as like how I actually

1397
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:47,690
talk about the product I don't think it

1398
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:49,850
changes anything at all I think even

1399
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:52,100
since like the the beginning day is

1400
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:53,480
eight nine years ago I got a tell like

1401
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,430
it is like if a products bad I'm gonna

1402
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,830
tell you exactly why it's bad but the

1403
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,570
good thing about that is a company who

1404
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,580
makes that product when you put out a

1405
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:03,950
review and say something's bad like

1406
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:06,560
let's say the battery life for the

1407
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:08,160
camera or whatever it's bad the fact

1408
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:11,160
that I'm telling the truth about it

1409
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,990
helps them to either improve it they can

1410
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,780
do a software update or to make a better

1411
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:18,060
one the next time and if no one told

1412
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,650
them it was bad they kind of wouldn't

1413
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,630
know like they put out a product the

1414
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:23,850
best they can and hope for the best and

1415
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:26,040
turns out the battery's bad no one wants

1416
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:27,150
it good to know make the next one bigger

1417
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,460
battery but if they don't get this

1418
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:32,940
useful valuable feedback about why

1419
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:36,690
something's bad it won't help the

1420
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,920
consumer a good example of that was I'll

1421
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,530
go back to when I was in college I

1422
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,180
reviewed a Motorola phone and I'd worked

1423
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:44,370
with him a bunch and the phone came out

1424
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,900
and I reviewed it and I went to the the

1425
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:47,280
specs and I was talking about the camera

1426
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,510
about how like this is the worst part of

1427
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,220
the phone if they only made the camera

1428
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:52,020
better this would be a great phone and I

1429
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,360
showed all these example photos and I

1430
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,220
reached out and I sent them a bunch of

1431
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,690
sample images I was pointing at circling

1432
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,460
stuff in the videos like here's where

1433
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:01,830
the coherent Hertz here's where dynamic

1434
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,380
range would've been better and there was

1435
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:06,150
software update like within weeks

1436
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:08,400
specifically addressing what I had asked

1437
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,750
about and sure enough like months later

1438
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,730
people are talking about what this this

1439
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,170
phones cameras gotten better that's

1440
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,340
pretty good for them so that and I'm

1441
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,440
sure the next phone had a better camera

1442
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:21,030
too so thanks to you I think we all win

1443
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,800
yeah when reviewers do their job what so

1444
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:26,250
this is my personal question um what

1445
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,880
what was the most exciting review that

1446
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:32,280
you ever made what was the worst review

1447
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,610
that you felt pain to have to make this

1448
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:39,630
review okay and then yeah I guess those

1449
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:41,880
two okay exciting review I don't know if

1450
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,680
it even counts as a review but I got to

1451
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,690
make it I've started this autofocus

1452
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,140
video series pretty recently where we

1453
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:55,290
talk about car tech which lets me review

1454
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:58,860
cars we're like five six episodes in but

1455
00:54:55,290 --> 00:55:03,630
I've already I was given a McLaren 720's

1456
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:05,820
for a week and easy we we shot it in

1457
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:07,620
like December and it was impossibly cold

1458
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,630
like every time we had to lean out a car

1459
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,460
window to get a shot it was like the

1460
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,780
camera would start to like freeze up and

1461
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,760
we'd have to take it back in like it was

1462
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,920
really hard to shoot but that was the

1463
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:20,370
most exciting product I think I've ever

1464
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:22,140
had damn you're upgrading man yeah

1465
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:25,560
they're like hey here's our car our new

1466
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:27,620
car the road out well that's every boxes

1467
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:30,420
it's already a thing there is already

1468
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:32,180
there's automotive journalists who kind

1469
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:35,190
of do this already they regularly

1470
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:36,750
receive cars to review and I know they

1471
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:39,150
have like press cars that like go around

1472
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,530
the country when I did the Tesla video

1473
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:43,590
that was a press car they don't do it

1474
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:46,020
very often but McLaren Toyota whoever

1475
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:47,700
they have a fleet of cars that they will

1476
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:50,790
give to press for a couple days and get

1477
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:53,100
take back so it's already a market that

1478
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:54,630
you can get into if you want I just had

1479
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,370
never done car videos and I don't know a

1480
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:58,590
lot about cars but as soon as I got my

1481
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:00,870
car I was like oh I love cars so I got

1482
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:04,010
started to get into that but yeah that's

1483
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:08,280
that was pretty exciting most painful

1484
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:11,060
yeah so the one that comes to mind was

1485
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,930
last year I reviewed the red hydrogen

1486
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:16,320
and I don't know if you heard about this

1487
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:17,550
what red makes great cameras and they've

1488
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,960
been in Hollywood they have the best

1489
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:24,360
color science I love my red cameras so

1490
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,530
red or last year about two years ago it

1491
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,080
started hyping that they're gonna make a

1492
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:29,850
smart phone oh that's gonna be a smart

1493
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,650
phone okay it's gonna have like the best

1494
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,940
camera in any phone right this is right

1495
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,920
around the time when smartphone cameras

1496
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,150
are getting really good Reds gonna get

1497
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,500
in the game they're gonna change the

1498
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:40,110
game all right I'm ready I'm ready for

1499
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:42,150
the red smartphone they were taking a

1500
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:43,830
while to make it there was all this hype

1501
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:45,930
building up and you could kind of tell

1502
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:48,090
that this was red not knowing how to

1503
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:49,380
make a phone really like every time I'd

1504
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:51,030
ask them for an update about it they'd

1505
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:53,040
be like oh we're we're doing carrier

1506
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:54,150
certifications so we're it's we're it's

1507
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,440
too late a little bit but it's gonna be

1508
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:58,560
great don't worry I was like I'm ready

1509
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,380
any time I'm ready and I made a video

1510
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:03,060
actually or they they gave me a world

1511
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,590
exclusive first look at like one of

1512
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,440
their first prototypes so people got

1513
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:08,930
what what the design would look like and

1514
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:12,300
so I'm everyone's ready for the phone

1515
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:14,250
super excited for it it finally comes

1516
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,260
out and when it comes out first of all

1517
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:17,730
the parts are so old because they've

1518
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,610
been working on it for two straight

1519
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:23,520
years it had like a two year old CPU the

1520
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:26,370
camera was an off-the-shelf Sony sensor

1521
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,740
with really not great photo quality

1522
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:31,740
didn't do high quality video which it's

1523
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:33,160
made by read/write of all headings that

1524
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:35,019
should be good exact

1525
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,869
it had a really big battery but like

1526
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:40,359
that it was a thick phone like it it had

1527
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:42,160
one of the worst screens of any phone

1528
00:57:40,359 --> 00:57:44,769
where they were claiming it could do

1529
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,869
like 3d really well but if you turn the

1530
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:49,329
3d mode off the actual display was like

1531
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:52,150
not nice so all these things flopped

1532
00:57:49,329 --> 00:57:53,589
fill hard on their faces and so my

1533
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:57,339
review of the phone was like I wanted

1534
00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:59,529
this to be good so bad but it was a one

1535
00:57:57,339 --> 00:58:01,390
Maya my I do smartphone worth at the end

1536
00:57:59,529 --> 00:58:06,039
of every year it won my worst phone of

1537
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:08,890
the Year award I get a little there they

1538
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:10,059
did not ask for their trophy some of the

1539
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,880
other companies asked for them they did

1540
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:14,890
not want this yeah I mean I guess that

1541
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,749
shows I go with show you you're honest

1542
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:18,640
you know like I mean you love the brand

1543
00:58:16,749 --> 00:58:19,839
but you had to be honest so exactly and

1544
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,489
I've been I went on and bought one of

1545
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:29,079
their cameras last week so okay that's

1546
00:58:21,489 --> 00:58:32,799

1547
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:35,170
