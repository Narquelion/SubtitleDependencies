farting is a natural process of life you

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,710

20
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:57,470

00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,199
meet people whose breath smells like

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,369
fart and sometimes it's worse so I don't

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,030
see why it's such a big deal everybody

26
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:10,399

cup so why is it such a big deal because

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,570
we make it to be I like to answer my own

33
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,619
questions isn't that right yes anyway

34
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,630
for those of you who don't know there's

35
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,640
four major types of parts the first one

36
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,990
is loud and proud these cars are really

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,460
loud and they usually don't smell that

38
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,440
bad so they're perfect for birthday

39
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,300
parties next we have the silent but

40
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,100
violent these parts are freakin ninjas

41
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,600
they just right out without anybody

42
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,360
knowing and yet those are the stinkiest

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,739
ones next we have the queefs these are a

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,920
bunch of wannabe farts that come from

45
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:51,319
the vagina posers and last but not least

46
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,700
we have the shorts these parts are the

47
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,050
reason you should never force on a fart

48
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,940
because if you do you might end up

49
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,860
farting ouch anyway those are the major

50
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,179
types of parts personally I think parts

51
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,349
are nothing to be ashamed of but for

52
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:01,550
those of you who are here's some

53
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:03,800
techniques for you guys to hide your

54
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,929
farts raising the volume all you have to

55
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,520
do is make noise louder than your fart

56
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,319

out that's genius see how easy it is so

70
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,900
stop trying to hold in your farts is

71
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,099
healthier if you just let it out because

72
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,180
if you don't let out your farts all the

73
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,290
gas inside your body is gonna start to

74
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,549
build up if it starts to build up it's

75
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,719
gonna make you expand if you expand too

76
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,769
