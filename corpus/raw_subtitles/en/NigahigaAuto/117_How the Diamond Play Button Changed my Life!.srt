over 10 million subscriber you know it's

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,099

00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:26,640

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,829
channels this one or higatv you know

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,210

00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:34,890
care you want to know why I don't care

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,390

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,670
thumbs in the 10 million subscriber

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:44,370
diamond play button ha ha ha that's

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,230

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,210
one too woo

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,550
Sehun is the hundred thousand silver

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,530
button when you got the gold and the

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,390
time I don't care at all most of the

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,410
time I mean I do care a little bit but

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,030
it's not like it's on my mind all the

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,320
time it's a little weird you know don't

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,059
you think it's freaking weird it's like

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,450
if you have a Wartortle and a Blastoise

28
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,769
but no spoon squared glad we're not but

29
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,960
anyway I'm getting totally off topic

30
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,909
video was not meant to be about what we

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,439
don't have but what we do have it for me

32
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,630
what I do have is a 10 million

33
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,210
subscriber diamond play button I can

34
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:20,340
honestly say to that change my life

35
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,340
oh my oh my god it's so bright

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,670
everything changed the day I got my

37
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,030
diamond play button I just got this

38
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,830
sense of empowerment knowledge I could

39
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,800
see the world for what it really was

40
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:36,850
water felt wetter I could suddenly see

41
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,560
the air move I couldn't smell music but

42
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,479
with this neat gift the vision I could

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,580
now see what this award really meant to

44
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,409
me wasn't about the fame that came with

45
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,720
it it wasn't even about the fortune it

46
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:49,840
was about making my dad proud my dad

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,910
want you to have this what is the Sun

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,440

you too dad okay yeah obviously I

57
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,280
exaggerated a lot receiving the diamond

58
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,050
play button didn't actually change that

59
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,630
much at least in terms of fame and

60
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,680
fortune like I said those things

61
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:24,670
fame fortune they never mattered to me

62
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,150
they never did it was and always has

63
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,299
been

64
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,950
about making my dad proud and that is

65
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:32,370
what the diamond play button really

66
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,959
meant to me dad want you to have this

67
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,670
what is this son to dia ten million

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,200
subscriber diamond play button there's

69
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,940
only a few people in the world that have

70
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,760
it and I want you to have it so you'll

71
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,840
finally be proud of what this [ __ ] oh

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,670
okay yeah maybe this award isn't

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,650
something that everybody understands and

74
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,750
appreciates it's a big deal I'm sure

75
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,459
maybe the award is a few years late cuz

76
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,290
most of us you know that celebrated 10

77
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,299
million subscribers did so about a few

78
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,220
years ago yeah it's not an Oscar an Emmy

79
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,170
so by having it you don't get more

80
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,519
famous or more wealthy in fact it's not

81
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,140
even made out of diamonds so it doesn't

82
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,730
add really any monetary value at all

83
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,760
what you don't want bro you naysayers

84
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,370
and doubters this this award is still

85
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,500
awesome oh yeah there's a lot that this

86
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,239
award can still do okay first of all it

87
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,799
still makes a great house decoration I

88
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,420
mean for you have to probably put on the

89
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,530
ground or like on a table or something

90
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,390
because it's too heavy to hang on the

91
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,100
wall but it's still nice to look at or

92
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,019
you could just carry it around with you

93
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,070
at all times because it makes a great

94
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:26,070
conversation starter

95
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:37,569
whose heavy season here has I got so

96
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:40,989
there's shine what is this oh yeah oh

97
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:43,000
wow a trophy or ten million subscribers

98
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,219
that's a lot of subscribers and if you

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,349
ask me you know like you say something

100
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:48,340
what what huh did you say something no I

101
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:52,120
don't think so

102
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,340
I didn't say okay cool cool look at this

103
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,379
no see and that's just a little taste of

104
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,790
how valuable and useful the diamond play

105
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,500
button really is I didn't even start

106
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,349
talking about how great of a paperweight

107
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,750
it is or a door stopper booster seat for

108
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:06,370
the short tin cans were like thin can

109
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,349
leave it out in the Sun it's a frying

110
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,510
pan in the freezer and you guys don't

111
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,099
want to talk right I'm sorry I actually

112
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,750
started this video as a thank-you video

113
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,549
to you guys clearly that didn't happen

114
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,989
obviously I was just joking earlier well

115
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,250
I mean kinda you really can't use those

116
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:19,959
words for all those things I mean

117
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,459
literally when I first opened it and

118
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,840
looked at the awards straight on I first

119
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,979
thought that actually came to mind what

120
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,680
I finally know what I would look like

121
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:30,909
from the point of view of spiders ken

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,010
went off track again in all seriousness

123
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:34,449
despite all the jokes I just want to

124
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,800
thank all of you guys and of course

125
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,599
YouTube as well many of you guys already

126
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,250
know this but I'm actually not that big

127
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:41,289
on award I don't normally watch any

128
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,380
award shows like most people do like the

129
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:45,639
Oscars Grammys Emmys Teen Choice VMAs

130
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,139
whatever nothing against them I just

131
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,430
don't find it interesting just my

132
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,690
opinion I mean it's human nature it's

133
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,070
all it always feels nice to get

134
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,770
recognized for something but my thought

135
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,479
process is and has always been that we

136
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,039
put a little too much value into these

137
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,630
awards and that's a whole nother topic

138
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,310
and don't get me wrong I am so

139
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,780
appreciative of this award like YouTube

140
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,520
didn't have to send us anything for 10

141
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,380
million subscribers but they still did

142
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,759
but what I'm even more appreciative of

143
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,620
is the fact that all of you are still

144
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,240
watching and supporting and I'm super

145
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,130
thankful to youtube not just for the

146
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,349
award itself but this award gave me an

147
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,030
excuse to make this video and thank all

148
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,259

hasn't changed you guys know that

like 50 40 percent 30 percent eating is

155
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,320
another 20 percent it's 50/50 percent

156
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,759
all my time goes into making these

157
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,169

158
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,880

170
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,480

an award to validate my existence and

172
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,630

you're much too confident and my

174
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,830
self-esteem is so high plus like I said
