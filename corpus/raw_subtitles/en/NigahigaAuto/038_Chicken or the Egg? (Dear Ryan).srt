00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,330
dear Ryan what came first the chicken or

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,040
the egg hey guys so I don't know why

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,720
this has always been such a popular dear

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,189
Ryan I mean it always has been I get

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,780
this one all the time I mean look how

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,280
many likes this one comment has I'm

7
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,870
finally just gonna put this ridiculous

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,549
question to an end once and for all I'm

9
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,020
gonna scientifically prove what came

10
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,940
first the chicken or the egg using the

11
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,050
power of math I'm not gonna lie you're

12
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,000
probably gonna need to know at least

13
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,070
basic algebra to follow along it's not

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,800
algebra it's like my version of Ryan's

15
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,449
algebra algebra you have to learn how to

16
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,039
Brian to understand this so in order to

17
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,480
answer the most famous question of all

18
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,650
time what came first the chicken or the

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,450
egg we're gonna need to start with the

20
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,680
most famous equation of all time e

21
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,270
equals mc-squared

22
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,579
in school they teach you that einstein

23
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,930
meant that e equals mc-squared is energy

24
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,430
equals mass times the speed of light

25
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,170
square that's completely wrong in

26
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,450
algebra what it really means is egg

27
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,010
equals matter times chicken little

28
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,570
floating number two and in order to find

29
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,460
out what came first we have to figure

30
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,570
out the matter at hand which is M we

31
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,100
have to figure out what M equals

32
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,110
basically we have to find out what M

33
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,120
equals by getting M by itself this is

34
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,440
where basic algebra comes if you take

35
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,789
the square root of both sides of the

36
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,199
equation the square root gets rid of the

37
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,270
little phone number two leaving you with

38
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,890
the square root of e equals M times C

39
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,330
and now to get rid of C you divide the

40
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,280
chicken on both sides leaving you with

41
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,689
square root of B over C equals M now

42
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,950
this may look even more confusing but

43
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,360
bear with me a little floating number

44
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,740
two and the C that we got rid of earlier

45
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,939
will help you to understand C if we were

46
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,470
to write this out we're left with

47
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,479
chicken little floating number two

48
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,830
notice anything familiar exactly Chicken

49
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,000
Little and the nursery rhyme Nursery

50
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,290
Rhymes were trying to tell us the whole

51
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,790
time Chicken Little as the one who said

52
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,080
the sky is falling and falling is the

53
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,520
opposite of floating so if we take the

54
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,400
opposite of Chicken little floating we

55
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,140
get egg big falling big egg falling what

56
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,909
big egg is most famous for falling yet

57
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,200
another Nursery Rhyme Humpty Dumpty the

58
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,270
same one Dee dummy that was on a wall

59
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,340
and had a great fall get it on a wall

60
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,750
great fall he was on the Great War the

61
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,490
Great Wall of China which means Humpty

62
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,229
Dumpty was tiny in fact his name wasn't

63
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,790
even Humpty Dumpty it was just who but

64
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,229
they added the Humpty Dumpty to make it

65
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,119
more pleasant for kids I guess but who

66
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,979
was indeed a Chinese egg which means he

67
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,180
came from a Chinese chicken explains why

68
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,680
chickens go Bock Bock Bock

69
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,420
they're trying to say Bock is in bok

70
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,860
choy like a Chinese cabbage and since

71
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,360
eggs are the opposite of a chicken in

72
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,250
this equation if the eggs name was who

73
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,200
the opposite of that is on that was the

74
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,090
name of the Chinese chicken ah ah the

75
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,770
Chinese chicken gave us who the Chinese

76
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,900
egg but as you know as much as chickens

77
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,970
do lay eggs

78
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,820
do hats chicken so uh doesn't just give

79
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,200
us who who gives up because chickens and

80
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,110
eggs are one but don't forget we still

81
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,220
have the number two one to twelve

82
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,890
you see if we go back to our original

83
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,450
equation square root of e over C is just

84
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,340
twelve because the square root of an egg

85
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,450
where eggs come from is a chicken and if

86
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,340
you're left with the chicken over a

87
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,350
chicken that's two chickens that become

88
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,820
one one to twelve

89
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,280
we all know that in egg terms that

90
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,660
twelve eggs is it does a dozen equals

91
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,370
matter so if you really want to know the

92
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,450
truth and put an end to the most famous

93
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,430
question of all time

94
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,830
all you need is basic algebra and the

95
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:44,360
answer is simple it doesn't matter who

96
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,590
gives us so thank you guys so much for
