1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,110
hey guys so after much request I finally

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,370
played Minecraft for the first time and

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,049
I know a lot of you out there that don't

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,240
like Minecraft probably gonna be like oh

5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,759
minecraft is for little kids well it's

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,410
not it's for big kids too and yeah I'm

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,179
not ashamed to admit it I enjoyed

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,310
playing it sure there's no storyline or

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,960
objectives and maybe it isn't meant for

10
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,910
people in their 20s in fact it's so easy

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,650
a five-year-old to play it and maybe it

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,090
does have the absolute worst graphics

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,970
I've ever seen in a game that's still

14
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,320
around today but I where was I going

15
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,939
with this but seriously the graphics are

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,099
so bad though I mean again the gameplay

17
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,480
is great it's just it's 2015 and the

18
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,680
characters look like this I feel like

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,710
just looking at them I can tell what

20
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,329
their voices sound like pretty normal

21
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,309
what were you expecting some kind of

22
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,860
primitive caveman type of voice dudes

23
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,989
versus anyway I played it I liked it and

24
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,930
I'm not afraid to admit it I enjoyed

25
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,149
playing minesweeper is so fun what's up

26
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,739
man dude I'm in the next room I can hear

27
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,600
you oh sorry about that keep the

28
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,109
minesweeper falling down pardon me added

29
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,120
version doesn't even have sound right

30
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:01,680
minority report the movie does and

31
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,270
that's probably what you heard me

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,369
talking about in the room next don't

33
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,320
he's still in the cage because I was

34
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,180
going to watch it later after I finished

35
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,119
watching my minor league football

36
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,520
baseball team play in the playoffs which

37
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,350
is being held in my Neapolis - oh no see

38
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,180
where the mining Apple is 40 miners look

39
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,560
I don't care if you play Minecraft just

40
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,689
keep it down I'm sick I'm trying to

41
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,520
study not lying I would love to be there

42
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:27,479
with my fellow 40 miners but I have a

43
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,150
torn meniscus in my knee and I can't get

44
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,070
it fixed because I have no my knee see

45
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,250
whatever man just keep it down alright

46
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,960
yeah whatever

47
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,460
as I was saying for those of you that

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,320
don't get minecraft at all I think it's

49
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,479
stupid I was just like you until I

50
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,950
played it how I understand it's actually

51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,540
pretty deep it really makes you think

52
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,820
about life I mean the graphics still

53
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,649
suck so the gameplay is amazing and it

54
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,390
has such deep meaning and by the end of

55
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,710
this video you'll see exactly why with

56
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,079
that being said here is my first

57
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,149
minecraft experience in real life in the

58
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,130
form of a movie movie trailer not a real

59
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,180
movie trailer but a YouTube video skit

60
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,180
trailer just take a look

61
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:10,170
I was spawned into this world with

62
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,830
nothing but the clothes on my back and

63
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,200
legs and feet I actually wanted to be

64
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,930
naked but the clothes wouldn't come off

65
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,379
so whatevs I discovered so many

66
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,870
mysteries so many things that were just

67
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:27,299
physically impossible but then again who

68
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,780
decides what impossible is in this world

69
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:34,230
not me I never really believed in the

70
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,959
gods mo yang blizzard eval none of them

71
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,180
the ancient tome or terms of agreement

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,450
manuscript had all the answers but it

73
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,030
was way too long so I skipped it and as

74
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,950
the Sun went down there was still so

75
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,640
many things I didn't understand about

76
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,670
this world all I knew for sure was that

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,440
this entire day this entire world was

78
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:05,190
just beautiful it was perfect

79
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:12,710
I I had no idea what was to come at

80
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,710
night as a neck stickers tickle stick

81
00:03:48,910 --> 00:04:01,450
I will continue to survive with no

82
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:04,930
purpose will continue to exist not live

83
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:07,540
what is life no purpose why are we here

84
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,330
all respond in this world to do how did

85
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,270
