1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
hey guys so late is Mother's Day today

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,609
or it was Mother's Day depending on when

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,379
you watch this video and I normally

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,120
don't ever do serious videos like this

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,440
especially videos that are related to

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,519
mother's day just because of the fact

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,750
that I know there's a lot of you out

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,070
there that don't have mothers and I

9
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,570
never wanted to make you guys feel bad

10
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,490
but then the more I thought about it you

11
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,630
know Mother's Day is all about

12
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,949
appreciation for mothers and even if you

13
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,289
don't currently have a mother you can

14
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,939
still show appreciation for and for the

15
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,560
rest of us that fortunately still do

16
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,689
have mothers it's a great reminder to

17
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,949
keep appreciating what you have but

18
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,660
anyway for those of you that don't know

19
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,830
why I made this video even though I just

20
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,570
posted like two days ago

21
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,760
I made a video in the TV app earlier

22
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,170
this week asking you guys to send me no

23
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,940
video messages for your mothers for

24
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,500
Mother's Day and I was honestly shocked

25
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,149
with how many videos we got and how

26
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,590
touching the or and let me apologize in

27
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,149
advance if your video wasn't chosen it

28
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,710
wasn't because your video wasn't good

29
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,030
there was just that many videos this

30
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,710
video would have been like an hour long

31
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,360
if I put them all in plus I had to make

32
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,890
room for some very special guests who

33
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,320
sent messages to their mothers as well

34
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,730
at the end of the video but you'll see

35
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,739
but before I show you all your messages

36
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,600
to your mothers I want to first and I

37
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,340
think for the first time ever publicly I

38
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,229
want to talk to you about mine unlike a

39
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,760
lot of other youtubers my mom is you

40
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,560
know not really known to the public

41
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,210
she's hardly ever in any of my videos

42
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,070
it's one of the only time she was

43
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,900
actually in a video skit was like back

44
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,549
in 2008 and I think that was around the

45
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,900
time when I was leaving Hawaii for the

46
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,100
first time you know it's moving away

47
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,140
from home

48
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,360
to come here and you know my mom had

49
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,340
some very nice beautiful going away

50
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,290
words for me I think she said my house I

51
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,729
did but not as serious no my mom is

52
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,470
nothing like that she would never say

53
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,119
that that's a big and force her to do

54
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,439
that line you could even see at the end

55
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,340
like she couldn't even keep a straight

56
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,400
face my mom is and I know everybody says

57
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,439
this but she's literally the best person

58
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,770
I can honestly say that I wish and I

59
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,189
strive to be as hard-working and nice

60
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,659
and genuinely kind as she is I mean

61
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,369
don't get me wrong just like any other

62
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,899
mother she can irritate the hell out of

63
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,670
me I mean she called me every single day

64
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,290
and I know that sounds super bad that

65
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,240
you know I'm saying that's a bad thing

66
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,759
but she called me every single day like

67
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,140
multiple times a day and it's always for

68
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,610
some reason when I'm filming like I'm

69
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,020
surprised that I was like 90% sure that

70
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,240
there was gonna be a call or something

71
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,160
right there

72
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,870
and mom I know you're gonna be watching

73
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,810
this video because you watch every

74
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,760
single one of my videos and because I

75
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,610
know I don't say this nearly enough I

76
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,220
just want to let you know that I I love

77
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:28,160
you and you know I I know I don't say

78
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,780
that a lot and it's probably your fault

79
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,520
as your upbringing you didn't teach me

80
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,110
you didn't teach I'm just I don't know

81
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,720
why I keep making jokes mom on a serious

82
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:41,570
note I love you so much you do so much

83
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:48,740
for me you have no idea you have no idea

84
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:54,590
how much well I never thought I'd be

85
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:57,370
that guy on a youtube video what is

86
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,320
wrong with me huh oh okay

87
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,110
[Music]

88
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:06,590
saved by the call this is not even a

89
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,360
joke thank you she saved me she saved

90
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,280
herself from making this too emotional

91
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,800
it's already too emotional I honestly

92
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,660
never thought I'd be that youtuber that

93
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,980
cries on his own video and I'm probably

94
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,470
gonna put this in the Edit because

95
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,210
that's never happened to me anyway now

96
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,190
