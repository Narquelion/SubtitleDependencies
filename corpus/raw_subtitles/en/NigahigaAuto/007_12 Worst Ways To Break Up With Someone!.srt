00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,240
hey guys so breakups are one of the many

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,589
tough things that people have to go

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,970
through and there's a lot out there and

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,140
how to deal with it or how to cope with

5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,519
breakup but there actually isn't that

6
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,870
much and how to break up with someone

7
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,670
and if you've ever had to do that before

8
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,200
you know that sometimes breaking up with

9
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,759
someone can be even harder than getting

10
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,109
broken up with especially if you still

11
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,730
care about the other person which is why

12
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,770
so many people end up using the worst

13
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,570
breakup tactic of all the text message

14
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,070
breakup as most of you know this is one

15
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,240
of the absolute worst ways you can break

16
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,310
up with someone and I know from personal

17
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,109
experience that it is just the worst

18
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,699
feeling ever it's downright rude and

19
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,840
college unless of course they did

20
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,980

seriously what you did this whole thing

72
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,810
just to break up with me just to make a

73
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,190
joke no I'm a relationship that's so

74
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,989
little to you that you can make a joke

75
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,760
out of all of this then I have nothing

76
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:18,019
to be sad about because it was never

77
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,519
real to begin with gee look honestly I I

78
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,250
didn't want to break up with you earlier

79
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,079
and I didn't know how to do it so I made

80
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,209
up all these stupid breakup jokes and

81
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,829
then I realized breaking up isn't tough

82
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,480
at all breaking up is easy most

83
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:32,640
relationships end because people just

84
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,220
give up on them and I know now

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm not ready to give up on this not

86
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,640
