1
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,680
right now we're in the desert this is no

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,770
place for fun and games you do not want

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,900
to get lost out here but every year

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:23,570
stupid tourists get lost out here every

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:27,330
week got a little rough on the dismount

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,830
but we're good let's go it's been nearly

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,320
three minutes and I'm completely

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:38,309
starving I need to eat fast or my

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:40,230
tummy's gonna hurt have to be really

10
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,329
careful he's one of the most dangerous

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,030
creatures of the desert the hippopotamus

12
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,300
I don't think he saw me yet so we're

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,790
still good but I was wrong all right

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,620
sneak up from his rear grab them that's

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,050
why I'll take them right this is

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,850
incredibly dangerous so don't ever try

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:02,340
this at home do it somewhere else

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,829
it was a bit risky but it's gonna be

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,590
worth it you can pretty much find these

20
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,719
uh these canned vegetables pretty much

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,820
anywhere you go especially in the

22
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,820
deserts I just gotta know where look and

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,049
that it's just that it's just awful this

24
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,460
is just awful

25
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,390
it was awful luckily uh

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,790
there's a technique that I heard about

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:34,380
from my mother's father's grandson where

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,330
you just take a big whiff that is much

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,920
much better

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,659
the ancient natives use this technique

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,340
to absorb half the vitamins and minerals

32
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:46,140
because half the taste is in the smell

33
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,310
all right we really need to get moving

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,770
we have a lot of ground to cover

35
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,290
I have to get moving now before the Sun

36
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,229
goes down because I'm afraid of ghosts

37
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,130
and that's about enough for today

38
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,479
I need to find some shelter please well

39
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,470
time to find some shelter because I

40
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,170
don't know what time it's gonna get dark

41
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,200
here but I luckily uh I usually I

42
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,729
usually have a watch but uh let me have

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,060
my cell phone so I can use it like a

44
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,240
sundial

45
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,920
and it's about it's about 10:30 p.m.

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,520
right now so I we really need to get

47
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,380
started

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,150
the ancient natives use this technique

49
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,610
with their cell phones but it's not

50
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,970
always completely accurate I was off by

51
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,220
about 6 hours I have to work hastily

52
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,690
because the Sun is going down and I need

53
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,340
something to protect me from all the

54
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:36,069
Predators and aliens so I've been

55
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,020
working about five hours now and I think

56
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:41,850
I think I got enough shelter to last me

57
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,850
the night here

58
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:57,189
but it's no time for rest I have to get

59
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:59,109
moving this terrain is incredibly

60
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:01,540
disorientating but luckily I can

61
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:03,400
navigate using the Stars so if you can

62
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,220
find the star all you have to do is

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:12,540
follow it and it will always always lead

64
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:15,480
you home 50% of the time unfortunately

65
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,200
for me this was not one of those times

66
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,200
I'm completely lost
