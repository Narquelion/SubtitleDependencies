1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,720
so today I'm going to be talking about

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:08,720
that that then can in banking that Oh

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,720
dancing

4
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,900
what an odd intro hey guys so today I'm

5
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,309
going to be talking about dance and to

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,380
be honest the real reason is because I

7
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:37,380
can't dance I'm just not good at it

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,420
it takes me a really long time to learn

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:48,250
the newest dances I mean I only just now

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,870
learned how to shuffle okay so maybe I

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,610
still don't not a shuffle big deal I am

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,470
so sick and tired of people inventing

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,910
new dances because by the time I learned

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,440
the newest dads there's like three more

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,519
and I'm like what did this happen you

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,350
know what kind of dances I'm talking

17
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:02,019
about right you know like the dougie the

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,400
stanky leg the cat daddy ethical yeah

19
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:05,320
there's a reason why I had someone else

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,909
do those dances because if I did it it

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,920
would look something like this the cat

22
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:12,659
