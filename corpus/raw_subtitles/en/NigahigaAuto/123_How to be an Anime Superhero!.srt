00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
hey guys so I've been watching just a

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:08,309
tiny bit of anime more than usual and to

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:15,000
be honest I I did not do my hair you

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:16,320
know what give me one second there we go

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,910
like I said I've been watching a little

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,410
bit of anime lately and if you grow up

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,270
watching anime your whole life like I

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,130
did you tend to not hear about or even

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,050
notice all the really weird things that

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,699
happen in anime well for a while like I

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,380
kind of stopped watching enemies and

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,670
only recently got back into it you know

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,140
I'm one of those binge watches when it

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,059
comes to show us I like to watch a bunch

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,890
of episodes in a row and then stop for a

16
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,239
while so the episodes filled up so that

17
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,800
I can watch a bunch again I don't know

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,360
it just it's upsetting to me you know it

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,829
really pisses me off they always end on

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,969
a cliffhanger and then we make you want

21
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,320
to know what's gonna happen next but you

22
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,670
can't know until a week from now and you

23
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,350
know what's even more upsetting with

24
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,059
animes is when you wait the whole week

25
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,649
for an episode and you finally tuned in

26
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,860
and it's time to watch the new episode

27
00:00:49,649 --> 00:01:01,440
and it turns out that that episode is a

28
00:00:51,860 --> 00:01:03,449
dare I say a filler that what are you

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,660
guys doing in here if vlog is taking too

30
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,909
long

31
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,500
seriously you complain about fillers and

32
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,619
this is literally turning into one yeah

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,680
so get to the point already

34
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:19,220
okay um welcome to how to how to be

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,220
anime stuff

36
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:29,430
welcome to how to be an anime superhero

37
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:30,930
let's let's get started lesson 1 the

38
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,490
characters the first step in being an

39
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,290
anime superhero is to know the different

40
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,759
characters Oh anime have very similar

41
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,020
characters to one another first off

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,450
there's the main character who's either

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,579
really cool and super strong or he's

44
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,079
really goofy and funny and receptively

45
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,070
strong then there's the main supporting

46
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,750
character who's either the main

47
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,340
characters best friend or the main

48
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,600
characters rival and this supporting

49
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,040
character is based off of the main

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,210
character he's literally the opposite of

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,810
what the main character is the main

52
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,000
character

53
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,710
cool then this guy is goofy if the main

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
characters goofy then this guy's cool

55
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,020
after that we have another main

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,119
supporting character known as the

57
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,430
attractive but abusive girl which for

58
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,899
some reason always abuses one of the

59
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,820
other main characters whoever's playing

60
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,439
the goofy one also there might be a

61
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,789
random type of bet that follows the gang

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,590
around as well and that's pretty much

63
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,090
your group of main characters of course

64
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,860
there's also the lesser important

65
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,540
characters as well such as the perverted

66
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,950
old man character the cute girl will

67
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,540
always talks while she smiles with her

68
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,709
eyes closed the guy who was animated

69
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,000
differently from the others for some

70
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,980
reason the chubby guy that's always

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,690
eating or the really skinny girl that

72
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,100
eats like a chubby guy and so on

73
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,720
put it honestly you don't really need to

74
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,920
know anything about those characters cuz

75
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,660
they're not as important to the

76
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,130
storyline even though you probably will

77
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,989
eventually learn everything about them

78
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,910
because of the dam fillers lesson -

79
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:37,290
anime emotions now that you know all the

80
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,760
enemy characters it's time to act like

81
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,709
well here are some very basic anime

82
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,630
motions that all anime superheroes need

83
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:44,280
to use such as the cheek blush the cheek

84
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:52,799
blush is basically or whenever your love

85
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:54,900
interest enters the room the hands

86
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:56,579
overhead lap very nervous situations or

87
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,760
trying to hide a secret of some sort do

88
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:03,630
you use the hands overhead laugh the

89
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:10,950
thumbs up shiny teeth ding the I pull

90
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:12,269
tongue dis the wide mouth stutter and of

91
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,470
course you cannot forget the classics

92
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,150
the nosebleed whenever a man

93
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,980
specifically an old man sees something

94
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,079
even the tiniest bit sexual for some

95
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,079
reason he has a tiny little nosebleed

96
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:32,280
don't worry about

97
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:34,390
I love that lipstick thank you so here

98
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:46,280

[Music]

100
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,459
lesson three battling every good anime

101
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,200
has some kind of battle in it whether

102
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,580
it's actual fighting or supernatural

103
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,840
fighting sometimes it's not even

104
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,580
fighting at all regardless there's

105
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,959
always some kind of battle and in order

106
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,490
to make it an anime battle you have to

107
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,320
follow a specific set of rules for

108
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,850
example in most real fights you want to

109
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,590
win as fast as possible but anatomies

110
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,090
the opposite you want to prolong the

111
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,920
fight as long as you can by talking to

112
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:14,760
your opponent the entire time even right

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:16,590
in the middle of the fight wait jeez man

114
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,329
what can we do at least take a moment so

115
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,650
I can say something like wow you're a

116
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:25,830
lot stronger than I thought you were

117
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:31,230
something I guess okay wow wow much

118
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:33,150
stronger than I thought you were hello

119
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:37,710
what don't you have something to say

120
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:39,570
back to me like oh uh thank you another

121
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,220
very important rule for battling like an

122
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,660
anime hero is to take turns yeah in a

123
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,370
real fight you might want to dominate

124
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,840
the entire fight and just win right away

125
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,460
but in anime battles you and your

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,110
opponent need to take turns having the

127
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,430
upper hand and also very important while

128
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,870
you guys are doing the back and forth

129
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,490
make sure that you're thinking about it

130
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,380
loudly in your head so that the viewer

131
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,340
knows who's winning at the time don't

132
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,340
want them to be confused

133
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:12,009
matched no it's getting even stronger

134
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,670
yes the upper hand now this rate I'll be

135
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:17,859
destroyed now or never

146
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:52,719

especially for someone like me every

149
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,189
great anime is in Japanese and if you're

150
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,319
just like me you don't speak a single

151
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,400
word of it hence lesson for googling all

152
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,110
you have to do is type in what you want

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,939
to say listen to what it sounds like and

154
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,979
then repeat it back perfectly it's 100%

155
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:12,279
accurate every single time or should I

156
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:17,979

00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:19,509
I go say anchor tag yeah lesson 5 make

158
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:21,430
an episode the last lesson you need to

159
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:23,319
know to be a true anime superhero is to

160
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,669
make a true anime episode yes there's

161
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,319
rules here as well you can't just jump

162
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:27,639
right into the story that's not how it

163
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,930
works in the anime world first of all

164
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,430
you need an opening theme song which

165
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,319
pretty much sounds like Japanese rock

166
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,939
music with the occasional English line

167
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,229
and you accompany that theme song with a

168
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:36,819
bunch of random scenes from the show

169
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,710
whether it's characters or people

170
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,939
punching and kicking or trees or water

171
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,500
whatever it is it doesn't really matter

172
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:43,509
because this is the part the viewers

173
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,399
gonna skip anyway next you have to recap

174
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,349
the previous episodes we all know that

175
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:48,939
anime watchers have the memory capacity

176
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:50,589
of a two-year-old and last but not least

177
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:52,120
all you have to do is show the title and

178
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:53,879
the episode number that the viewer is on

179
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,009
and you're ready to begin the episode

180
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,930
right after you recap the recap that the

181
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:00,430
viewer just saw there you have it if you

182
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,409

183
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,599
all together congratulations you are an

184
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:05,790
anime superhero and it should look a

185
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:25,530
little something like this
