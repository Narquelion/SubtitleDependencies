1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
you know what I don't understand Korean

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,060
dramas or all asian dramas they're all

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,500
pretty much the same thing and yet

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,389
people spend hours and hours watching

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,370
them I can pretty much predict what's

6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,349
gonna happen in every single drama first

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,440
they're in love and then they're sad

8
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,420
love comes back and then they're mad and

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,220
then somebody dies and for all of you

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,910

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,869
