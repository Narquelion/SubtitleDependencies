your head in order for others to believe

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,289
you're a badass you have to first

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,940
believe you're a badass so let me ask

23
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,680
yourself this do you ever feel like I

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,670
don't not not look like a badass even

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,289
though you never not should not feel

26
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,780
like you do not look like badass like

27
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,399
exactly the answer is no don't I

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,229
backwards I don't know

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,820
now take a good look at yourself right

30
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,409
now if I were to hold a mirror up to

31
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,939
y'all right now you know what you'd see

32
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,280
a weak skinny

33
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,900
cheap tripod from Walmart holding up a

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,369
camera but if that camera were to take a

35
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,259
picture of you right now and you were to

36
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,210
upload that picture to iPhoto or some

37
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,950
other picture editing program using a

38
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,930
hustler would you really say that this

39
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,320
is you this is what a badass looks like

40
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,210
no cuz you are a person not a picture on

41
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,340
a piece of paper you're a man even for

42
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,140
you women out there you're a man recap

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,450
step 1 get it through your head and

44
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,119
let's move on step 2 stop being a little

45
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,430
right now you're a little you're soft

46
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,200
easily proved yellow-skinned as much as

47
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,220
I hate seeing the B word I might use it

48
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,049
for M passes y'all a bunch of bananas

49
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,909
right now if you want to be a real

50
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,560
badass you can't be no banana double

51
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,420
negative never show weakness

52
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,790
you ever feel pain you must never show

53
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,680
it again real badasses never cry even in

54
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,240
the most painful situations imagine a

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,680
poor example you walked into your

56
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,420
brother's room causing you to step on a

57
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,520
lego and now you're trapped don't you

58
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,320
ever cry for help all you have to do is

59
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,299
use the figure-eight maneuver and figure

60
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,829
it out you accidentally poured all your

61
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,690
milk first and realize you ain't got no

62
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,300
cereal left don't you tear a breakdown

63
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,700
in crime so you'll always go

64
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,280
on sale it's no big deal get your bike

65
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,230
are don't you dare lean get up that's

66
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,240
right then brush yourself off limp to

67
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,980
the nearest electronics store and get up

68
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,420
just because you can and last but not

69
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,280
least people keep telling you that your

70
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,710
puns are not funny and yet you see your

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,720
puns all over Facebook and 9gag other

72
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,470
website I thought even given you grin so

73
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,120
what do you do

74
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,920
don't you dare complain about it in a

75
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,170
video you create a pun that's so

76
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,940
ridiculously stupid that there's no way

77
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,220
someone else could take credit for it

78
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,620
how you ask just by making mints you

79
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,690
take a mint coffee imperfectly so it's

80
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,340
just right put it in the fridge and boom

81
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,110
next time someone tries to steal your

82
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,200
bad punch to show them what you made

83
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:54,560
copyright infringement so again to recap

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,230

move on nobody got time for step 3 step

88
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,500
2 took too long

89
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,330
