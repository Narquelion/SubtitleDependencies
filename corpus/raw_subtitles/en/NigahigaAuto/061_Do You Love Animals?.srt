00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,060
hey guys so yesterday was Thanksgiving

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,589
and the day before that I went to the

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,180
market to go buy a turkey because I like

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,570
market turkeys better than homemade

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,340
anyway and partially also because I was

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,630
too lazy to cook I know so I don't know

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,139
how to cook but anyway as I was at the

8
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,330
checkout counter checking out my turkey

9
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:23,789
well really no one this time all right

10
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:27,480
doctor she said really she said it so

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,220
you know anyway as I was checking out

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,810
minding my own business this old lady

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,420
comes up behind me and feel the need to

14
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,850
preach to me and your total is 21 figure

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,290
Oh having a Thanksgiving dinner

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,750
oh yeah it's for tomorrow about you I'm

17
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,890
vegan so yeah I just don't really

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,690
believe in the whole slaughtering

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,680
animals thing I mean really you should

20
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,850
think about it there are a lot of

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,649
documentaries online that you can watch

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,300
and it is just disgusting I mean what

23
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,879
gives a person the right to decide

24
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,699
whether it and then that exact moment

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,340
right then right there that's when I

26
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,890
realized this cashier did not even have

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,550
my back he didn't say one word giving is

28
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,830
just sick immoral and wrong yeah no I

29
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,040
yeah I'm probably still gonna get this

30
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,659
Turkey so okay so maybe I didn't say

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,890
that last part term but I think vegans

32
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,600
are awesome they don't eat anything that

33
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,049
has to do with Adam which actually saves

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,189
a lot of animals for the rest of us even

35
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,750
though I can't stand with you or try to

36
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,250
force their beliefs unto other people

37
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,689
that old vegan lady kind of had a point

38
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,950
and it's kind of messed up to say out

39
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,990
loud but when I think about it I

40
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,150
actually don't value an animal's life as

41
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,560
much as a human I mean I love my dog but

42
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,470
if there was a ring that will stop not

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,820
anymore I mean I love my dog so much but

44
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,070
if there was a car that's about to hit a

45
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,079
person and a dog I probably pushed the

46
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,640
person on the way instead but if I did

47
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,500
that I probably get hit by the car too

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,119
and that would suck I mean I probably

49
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,430
just do the logical thing and as the car

50
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,110
drives by I jump into the moving cars

51
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,070
window force the drivers foot down on

52
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,990
the brake till it comes to a complete

53
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,970
stop grab the cell phone he's texting on

54
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,040
halsted outside shifted into reverse run

55
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,659
the phone over pull up my arsenic inject

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,340
him in the neck shove the body outside

57
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,170
of the car put it back into Drive and

58
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,579
steer it away from the man and just hit

59
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,689
the dog so that I could save his life

60
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,100
and then I'd probably have to run him

61
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,810
over as well because he just witnessed

62
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,189
me kill a guy and run over a dog just to

63
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,960
save his life but the point is I would

64
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,140
save the man's life over the dog and

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,010
then enough to kill him as I was saying

66
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,390
I always saw myself as like an animal

67
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,769
but I guess I never realized how little

68
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,360
society actually values their lives

69
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,920
compared to ours think about if a human

70
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,450
kills another human he ends up in Jim

71
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,129
and Adam a were to even harm a human it

72
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,450
wouldn't go to jail we probably kill in

73
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,890
fact most of our pets that we love the

74
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,720
most are pretty much already in jail

75
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,519
take dogs for example we lock them up so

76
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,080
they don't run away they only eat when

77
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,519
we tell them to and if you have two dogs

78
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,959
I mean they might not be in a shower but

79
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,580
there's always that one dog that likes

80
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,709
to hump the other one even people who

81
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,120
love animals most like zookeepers think

82
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:38,709
about in an animal's perspective they're

83
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,750
pretty much just a warning of a Big Joe

84
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,010
that profits off of their prisoners so

85
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,010
overall I guess what I'm really trying

86
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,049
to say is I get it now into the video ad

87
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,030
standing behind me in the market thank

88
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,859
you thank you for helping me open my

89
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:59,160
eyes and realize that animals really are

90
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:59,160
a lot less important than I thought they
