00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,829
David David in me up after that have a

16
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,840
so he's like dude people hate me that's

17
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,989
what she said people did hate me cuz I

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,399
was so passionate about Apple you well

19
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,969
there was that and they said and I

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,660
talked over you yeah I apologize

21
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,640
well I mean I don't think you have to

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,890
apologize at the time the funny thing is

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,600
like even for me like there's a lot of

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,090
things I didn't notice I did until we

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,520
started doing this yeah yeah it's true

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,259
because no when we normally converse

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,909
it's like we are pretty much talking

28
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,170
like over each other all the time but

29
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,900
you don't really notice it until you

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,420
watch it on film being on yeah being in

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,299
front of a camera it's very different

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,439
than in person mm-hmm right yeah but but

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,790
the thing is like I think a lot of

34
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,590
people don't realize like they're like

35
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,630
so irritated that you kept staying on

36
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,100
that and seeing not like you know maybe

37
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,549
you had your point of view and it seemed

38
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,479
like you weren't you you were trying to

39
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,909
prove your point I was trying to prove

40
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,680
my point and we just kept clashing yeah

41
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,979
and we talking over each other and I was

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,540
also low-key trolling just a little bit

43
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,960
you were trolling in the beginning

44
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,549
especially but I think you know well now

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,110
you know that people don't like it you

46
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,100
won't like the troll I'm sorry guys I'm

47
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:01,770
a naturally I'm gonna comment but you

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,570
left I wrote I forgot what I wrote like

49
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,140
I apologize I won't do it again or

50
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,479
something like that

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,860
dude you should do it I should just what

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,860
I should do it again no

53
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:14,580
you will probably me they're like damn

54
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,019
why is David back on the podcast we

55
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,690
don't know that David's actually

56
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,790
incredibly funny but he's what do you

57
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,650
call that it's just dry like dry humor I

58
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,310
have dry humor people think I'm an

59
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,560
[ __ ]

60
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,880
but it's swear look it's so funny like

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,090
how do you explain that like most people

62
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,500
like when you first meet David it's like

63
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,390
you almost have to do a disclaimer I

64
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,640
feel like cuz you're so blunt and like

65
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,450
I'm honest I like to be honest very

66
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,630
honest yeah um but I mean it in a I'm

67
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,549
honest in a nice I try to be nice yeah

68
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,380
you got mean em I mean I don't think you

69
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,209
know but you do say things out most

70
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,380
people be like ooh he really said that

71
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,060
mean it's true but it's things that

72
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,150
people are thinking I just say it

73
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,920
because I feel like if it's better no

74
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,480
he's like yeah better to say than to

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,130
just hide it and pretend that you're not

76
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,110
really thinking it that's true

77
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,269
I guess that's I mean with sometimes I

78
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,489
do assume as well that people are

79
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:13,079
thinking something and I say it and then

80
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:16,230
I may be wrong what like I didn't we'd

81
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,190
roll one again but I mean I just felt

82
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,079
like I should have brought that up

83
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,560
because thank you last time there was so

84
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,819
much negativity and I think people

85
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,350
misunderstood you mm-hmm and you were

86
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,850
hotted it I mean you you were like

87
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,920
actually kind of down from that for a

88
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,989
little bit I was a little like you know

89
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,540
cuz I have it so I don't know if your

90
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,700
your audience knows I I actually also

91
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,690
make youtube videos I feel like some

92
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,430
people don't even know that they

93
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,500
probably end up just I mean they know

94
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,540
they're like well David makes a lot of

95
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,430
the songs he makes all the BGA songs he

96
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,250
Huichol a black cuz David actually

97
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,900
started before me making music and then

98
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,840
you also dislike MIT little like blogs

99
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,760
and blogs yeah those youtuber youtuber

100
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,290
I'm one of the earliest actually I

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,329
talked about on the junior podcast how

102
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,859
he saw you first and you kind of

103
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,450
inspired him hmm

104
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,790
but you're like you're like grandfather

105
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,400
YouTube you're like a year before me old

106
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,889
guy yeah old man almost I got some white

107
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,889
hairs here as you can see but

108
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:13,500
traditionally because your brand is so

109
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:15,450
clean and your musics like really nice

110
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,359
and it's like weird love like love music

111
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,250
and hates what it is thanks guys people

112
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,659
have always been from what I seen like

113
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,370
you've I've gotten way more hate than

114
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:23,760
you've ever gotten throughout your

115
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,730
career

116
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,860
I think until it's because you have

117
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:33,120
2,000 those had I've ever gotten on

118
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,980
YouTube but fun huh but yeah this cuz

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,960
you had a larger I think like the bigger

120
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,310
your audience gets its its but I think

121
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,440
for the most part you'd get a lot of

122
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,920
great comments because you put so much

123
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,970
oh yeah I I want to bring this up

124
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,600
because I've been watching all the

125
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:51,030
podcasts very closely you you know the

126
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,150
the one that Arden was on the last

127
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,700
episode she mentioned how much you work

128
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,000
to two episodes ago or two episodes yeah

129
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,310
yeah that is absolutely true

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,810
I mean for some of the listeners are you

131
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,300
bringing that up I mean no because I

132
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,400
think like the success that you've had

133
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,060
on YouTube it's because of your work

134
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,920
ethic you know just for the listeners I

135
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,200
know I come me I come out to Ryan's

136
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,000
house probably once every like once a

137
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,600
month once a month then once every two

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,930
months and you know he wakes up he

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,970
starts writing and then we eat some

140
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,220
lunch and then he goes back to writing

141
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,830
he does that almost every day if he's

142
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,630
not shooting you know I I as a friend

143
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,330
want him to have a good life as well so

144
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,970
I try to you know I'll be like hey look

145
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,340
let's go out to let's get some food

146
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,440
outside of your home instead of post

147
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,560
mating it you're just adding on to what

148
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,480
Arden said about me I am I have to slit

149
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,050
a loser that just doesn't leave a loser

150
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,730
but yes it's true Ryan does not leave

151
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,440
his home Wow

152
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,720
it's hard but you know what your success

153
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,630
is deserved well-deserved because you do

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,460
put so much time and energy to create

155
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,550
content for your fans I think it's it's

156
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,310
a it's that's why that's why you know

157
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,770
you make great content well thanks well

158
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,800
said I think you you tried to shift the

159
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,050
focus away from your feelings as we were

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,150
talking about how you felt when you got

161
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,370
all that hate for the first time and it

162
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,240
also because it also once brings up

163
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,550
something me and will we're talking

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,750
about earlier yeah how did that I mean I

165
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,820
only really the first time you got that

166
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,150
much hate I like fell board yelling at

167
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,130
you

168
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,770
yeah comments I was triggered I was

169
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,169
definitely triggered triggered or what

170
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,479
you said because there's a difference

171
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,249
hmm sure thank you felt misunderstood so

172
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,740
he was a little mad triggers called

173
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:46,560
misunderstood okay yeah I felt that peep

174
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,499
like you know the Internet's very quick

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,050
to judging you know I consider myself a

176
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:54,300
pretty nice person in general and when a

177
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,240
nice person is getting hate you just

178
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,939
feel like it's unfair I feel like why

179
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,550
why me yeah yeah I do

180
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:05,400
did I kick a dog but the interesting

181
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,409
thing is that you're so used to and

182
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,110
analytical about being on YouTube and

183
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,639
understanding how you know even if it's

184
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,529
a bunch of people it's still a minority

185
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,539
and people would dislike me you're I was

186
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,949
surprised that most times you would just

187
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,719
kind of shrug that off because you

188
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,460
understand like hates gonna happen yeah

189
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:23,009
but I've never seen it happen to you

190
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,839
that much it's because I've been gone

191
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,669
from YouTube for so long and I forgot

192
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,560
what it feels like to get hate to get

193
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,039
hate let alone that much hate that much

194
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,169
hate yeah yeah do you see it from their

195
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,710
perspective yeah I agree with a lot of

196
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,719
those colors you know so when you say

197
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,089
why me it's like okay yeah I mean I'll

198
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:44,039
admit my faults and things that I've

199
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:45,839
done wrong in the past like you know

200
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,370
honestly I didn't even notice it me

201
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,770
neither watched it back and I was like

202
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,969
oh he is kind of doing that after I saw

203
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,990
the comments I was like oh I didn't even

204
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:54,000
really notice it because that's just how

205
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,159
we talk yeah me and David we don't like

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,539
argue but we go we believe in something

207
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,189
we're not so hard we're not gonna just

208
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,620
agree with you to make you feel good

209
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:03,360
yeah I think that's dishonest I agree I

210
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,580
think we're both like that yeah

211
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,699
very blunt yeah and I disagree with

212
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,529
everything you just said right now okay

213
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:16,620
there's the troll David coming up and

214
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:18,990
all that brings me to what we what we

215
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,990
were talking about almost like well we

216
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,669
just saw the Kevin Hart thing on Joe

217
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,719
Rogan he just did this thing you want to

218
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,699
bring that up because I thought that was

219
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:29,069
super interesting what we're not yeah I

220
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,169
think I just saw today was a on the Joe

221
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:36,019
Rogan podcast he had Kevin Hart and

222
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:39,289
Kevin Hart had a super insightful

223
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:41,819
explanation and like point of view from

224
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,610
to talk about I don't wanna say it's

225
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:46,140
like being affected by the comments

226
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,050
right you know if he has videos online

227
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,110
or whatever and he was basically just

228
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,270
saying

229
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,430
I mean he was kind of bagging on people

230
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,620
that you know comment mean comments

231
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,800
essentially yeah in saying you know how

232
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,260
do you have so little time or so much

233
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,880
time so excuse me so much time to sit

234
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,140
there and like formulate thoughts and

235
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,210
then sit there and type something

236
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,010
negative it what's the purpose what's

237
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,840
the purpose like and especially for

238
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,820
someone like Kevin Hart who never stops

239
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,890
working and he's always doing something

240
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,580
you know his point of view was like

241
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:21,220
really really smart and I really felt it

242
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,630
honestly yeah I mean I mean you want to

243
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,430
talk about like what he was saying cuz I

244
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,990
think it applies to like you know what

245
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,830
David was saying too but the thing is he

246
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,600
gets I think he gets it on such a such a

247
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,030
bigger level than any of us right it's

248
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,530
like you have to like figure it out at

249
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,750
some point or you're gonna go crazy like

250
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,280
cuz if you had that every day you would

251
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,230
have to figure out how to deal with that

252
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,520
or else you'd probably like be depressed

253
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,260
and kill yourself or you wouldn't make

254
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,180
videos altogether like you would be so

255
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,620
sad and mad all the time you would ruin

256
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,650
your life you would have to figure out

257
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,080
how to deal with that I mean yeah that's

258
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,810
basically what I took from it was just

259
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,250
kind of looking at their perspective of

260
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,680
like okay it's probably someone who

261
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,210
maybe it's a little negative or not

262
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,010
doesn't just has a ton of time and

263
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,570
they're not really working hard on

264
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,150
something for on their own side you know

265
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,430
that's kind of what I took from it and

266
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:11,350
to I mean especially for someone like

267
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,050
you to you're a very busy person to it's

268
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,950
like you know I mean yes you got stuff

269
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,910
to do positive things I focus on and

270
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:23,140
yeah I just felt like he had such a

271
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,520
smart like articulate 'iv is that the

272
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,530
word heal it responds yeah like his

273
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,140
thought about it in such a I don't know

274
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:32,170
such a smart way I mean I did something

275
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,000
similar to we've kind of I mean I've not

276
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,650
really addressed it in I mean I've said

277
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,500
it in vlogs before but it's not I didn't

278
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,840
make a whole video about it but I mean

279
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,780
that the reason behind someone leaving

280
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,490
something so negative is because I mean

281
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,410
the reason why anyone does anything is

282
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,150
for themselves you know like you always

283
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,310
do it because you think it's gonna be

284
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,290
make you better not a better person just

285
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,520
make you feel better or it's it's you

286
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,780
that's the reason why everyone does

287
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,460
everything you want to feel so yourself

288
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,990
you can yeah yeah so it's even if you

289
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,430
make someone mad it'll make you laugh or

290
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,320
maybe they're doing it because they want

291
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,630
they feel so bad about themselves that

292
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,480
want other people to feel that pain yeah

293
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,860
that's what I think because I've felt

294
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,690
that before I felt like I wanted to

295
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,340
leave like a negative comment somewhere

296
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,110
just because I'm if I was like that

297
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,430
person I know that I would be getting

298
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,470
these comments and no one's leaving it

299
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,750
you know like I know if like I said that

300
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,490
I know I would get these responses

301
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,260
negative responses and it makes me want

302
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,340
to be like man I should get no one

303
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,260
saying the negative thing that I know

304
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,550
that would be said if I said it right

305
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,130
you know just because they're not

306
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:34,280
popular whatever it is so I mean there

307
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,960
there's it there I understand it not

308
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,070
that I would do it and I don't because

309
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,720
obviously I I think mature past that but

310
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,860
I can see if I was a kid that didn't

311
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,220
really do YouTube and I was like upset

312
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,230
with my life and I mean it doesn't mean

313
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,060
it I'm anonymous nobody knows nobody's

314
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,590
gonna know right I would write some ID

315
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,810
probably because I would feel bad for

316
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,330
I'll be a troll there's power behind you

317
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,420
know having the Internet in front of you

318
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,640
right yeah being unseen and like you

319
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:05,570
said I mean what I wonder from you guys

320
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,580
perspective is should people be allowed

321
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,340
to have but like write bad comments and

322
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,290
be trolls yeah what do you mean yes yeah

323
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,650
freedom of speech yeah I think there's

324
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,030
nothing I mean I don't honestly think

325
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,440
you people need to understand I think

326
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,390
you know what the difference is is I

327
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,850
grew up playing games and I know you did

328
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,170
- yeah and it's so filthy like it's like

329
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,660
the worst things you'll ever hear people

330
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,490
who say to you like way worse than some

331
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,440
of the click some comments you read that

332
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,870
you become almost like for me it's like

333
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,940
well that's ridiculous is a joke yeah

334
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,860
does even hurt me it's so bad that it's

335
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,110
a joke the ones that really do hurt is

336
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,400
when it's not necessarily hurt but like

337
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,200
when it's a critique and it's actually

338
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,030
well thought out and it's like man

339
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,080
that's kind of true there's truth that's

340
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,130
where it kind of hurts and I guess

341
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,690
that's when you get triggered more

342
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,720
because it's well thought they like

343
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,850
analyze who you are as a person they got

344
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,060
deep inside and then they're like oh

345
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,290
wait whoa but in a way I don't think

346
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,540
that's bad either I think that's good

347
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,850
yeah sometimes I would agree like I like

348
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,370
I mean I don't like it but nobody likes

349
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,040
it but I like critiques constructive

350
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,720
calm yeah like I like that's how I

351
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,220
learned like I disagree with Joe Rogan

352
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,330
he always says don't read the comments

353
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,530
he tells all his guests like why you

354
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,360
guys read the comic don't read tweets

355
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,270
don't read the comments I disagree with

356
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,950
that I think I've learned throughout all

357
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,900
the years and and tried to improve

358
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,150
because of the comments earning like it

359
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,070
not taking everything at face value yeah

360
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,530
is his perspective is like hey if you're

361
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,940
gonna get offended by the comments it's

362
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,490
gonna change your comedy and I

363
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,410
understand that but you just have to

364
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,150
know what to listen to him what not to

365
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,480
get what he's coming where he's coming

366
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,730
from

367
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,320
but he always instructs his guests like

368
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,420
and you know people get affected by that

369
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,010
to not read the comments and I don't

370
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,640
really I don't know I don't agree with

371
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,450
that completely

372
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,560
so I saw recently that there was a and I

373
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,390
need to talk about this because we just

374
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,320
flew on it there was a thing about

375
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,850
Southwest and how was it there well they

376
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,870
got their shares got downgraded or

377
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,720
something like that because of the

378
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:02,540
recent um was that crash to Ethiopian

379
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,340
Airlines yeah the new so the Boeing jet

380
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,280
is apparently is the second crash of

381
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,980
that same type of jet in the same in

382
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,610
like fought like less than half a year I

383
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,560
know

384
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,510
and the reason I'm thinking about it is

385
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,980
because remember that we just will and I

386
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:19,940
just took a flight to go actually to

387
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,350
record with David and we had the crazy I

388
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,180
was one of the craziest flights I've

389
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,110
ever been on where I felt like it fell

390
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,370
like we were on a roller coaster you

391
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,470
know when you'd that feeling when you

392
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,000
yeah Mike right yeah and it was like if

393
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,920
they like that for a good like sometimes

394
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,870
at like five second at a time it's like

395
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,220
we're calling like the seat wasn't like

396
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,380
we weren't touching the seat it felt

397
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,870
like obviously we were right for like 15

398
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,250
minutes I would say yeah long constant

399
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,140
yeah honson like up and down but there

400
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,670
was like some moments where that drop

401
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,290
feeling it didn't seem like we were

402
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,900
dropping but it you had that feeling of

403
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,520
like being in the air for like five

404
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,230
seconds at a time I was like this is the

405
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,700
craziest thing this is not normal where

406
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,410
people are sitting out in the plane was

407
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,420
some people some kids screaming and like

408
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,670
there's some people screaming but it was

409
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,650
a they did warn us and it was super

410
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,450
windy so I'm gonna attribute it to that

411
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,830
you know and ideologically I'm thinking

412
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,660
I don't normally get bothered by that

413
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,310
stuff yeah me neither yeah we know the

414
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,200
statistics too like I know that it's

415
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,030
like actually don't know the statistics

416
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,800
but I know it's like million one in a

417
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,090
midlife ten million or something like

418
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,980
that the chance that you're gonna crash

419
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,510
right right it's super slim but you

420
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,820
think about it every time you fly I'm

421
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,920
sure right I think about it not every

422
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,200
time I think about every time I fly I

423
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,880
mean I don't I don't really think even

424
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,260
for like a slight second like yeah yeah

425
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,570
slight second I'll be like I could down

426
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,550
this flight but whatever I've had a I've

427
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,500
had a flight where now is like

428
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,060
I wouldn't even like depressed I was

429
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,960
just like really not having a good day I

430
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,700
was like I don't even care if it crashes

431
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,590
that's really I really had that damn I

432
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,570
was having a very bad day I think it was

433
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,220
like girl problems you know what girls

434
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,450
but I had that feeling I remember

435
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,540
thinking and the project won't even care

436
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,010
if it crashes so tough like that

437
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,450
the bumpy thing like yeah I said it was

438
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,520
super windy I think there is something

439
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,320
specific to like our region though that

440
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,020
because I think flying in and out of

441
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,850
like Vegas is pretty notoriously bad

442
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,770
right and it's something to do with like

443
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,420
the temperature different Hills yeah and

444
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,890
we like go over like the hills into

445
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,560
California or wherever it's never been

446
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,240
that bad no that was crazy I was bad and

447
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,370
and then I read this article and I was

448
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,720
like okay this is the second one in six

449
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:19,940
and it's the same kind of jet right a

450
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,020
Boeing was a Boeing seven was it I don't

451
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,550
know you know you know what it is that

452
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,310
those jets it's a very common one it's a

453
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,140
second crash in five or six months or

454
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,790
something like that and what they're

455
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,140
seeing is they're stopping production on

456
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,630
those jets right now and they're saying

457
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,720
it because those crashes were attributed

458
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,820
to all investigators suspect faulty data

459
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,400
feeding into the aircraft's automated

460
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,590
flight says that's crazy

461
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,990
yeah so like who knows like I mean I

462
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,300
don't know if I can be talking about

463
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,510
this guy wants protects protects but I

464
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,040
saw this article yeah and I mean would

465
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,560
you fly south I mean like that's what I

466
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,670
fly I'm already flying on it I know this

467
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,500
way you know what it's not even about

468
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,130
the airline because all airlines have

469
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,380
Boeing's

470
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,930
Boeing airplanes what's that specific

471
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,750
one I guess yeah no but the the that

472
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,880
specific airplane is sold to Southwest

473
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,770
yeah yeah you know like all these photos

474
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,570
each airline have the same pretty much

475
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,790
exactly the same I don't know I think

476
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:17,170
they have the exact same planes but like

477
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:20,390
for example the Boeing 737 most airlines

478
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,800
use the 737 mm yeah I think that's what

479
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,530
it was I think that's the that's the

480
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,490
plane they're talking about but like if

481
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,620
they're having that I mean I never

482
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,360
really like even if there are is a plane

483
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,950
crashes okay well okay ten million more

484
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,420
flights and it won't happen you know

485
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,450
another 10 million or whatever that

486
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,560
number is but the fact that has happened

487
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,270
and they're acknowledging there's an

488
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,470
actual problem I feel this is the first

489
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,460
time I actually feel like Dan this is

490
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,020
risky

491
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,820
yeah and it's such a short period of

492
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,010
time five or six months too

493
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,990
plane crash just an outlier yeah just

494
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,950
makes me feel uneasy I know all the

495
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,410
people who are about to have a flight

496
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:54,080
coming up sorry yeah let's say you have

497
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:58,820
a bike coming up behind Jesus look good

498
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:05,060
luck - thanks guys hmm but on a brighter

499
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:07,400
note I don't know that's my wine Ted so

500
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,470
I wanted to crash one time and all these

501
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,030
other crashes r.i.p to other people

502
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,200
there's killed like the whole I think

503
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,560
everyone on board like over 100

504
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,840
something people wow it's really sad and

505
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,520
scary nightmare seriously yeah

506
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,900
that's your worst nice you know I when

507
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,090
I'm on the plane there are times are

508
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,130
nice you know I've been on like probably

509
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,750
hundreds of planes in there are a lot of

510
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:30,230
moments where I'm just thinking what

511
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,660
what do I do if it crashes into the

512
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,760
ocean I've thought - that's a forest

513
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,020
what if I'm the only one alive I don't

514
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,420
know why I think like I'm the only one

515
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,590
alive because I guess if you're dead you

516
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,120
wouldn't be thinking about it but like

517
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,470
yeah you wouldn't even be in that

518
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,700
situation right you wouldn't matter

519
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,870
right but if you're alive then it

520
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,330
doesn't matter because you could still

521
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,890
survive tried and III definitely think

522
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,040
about that I get really deep like all

523
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:54,200
the smokes in in the cargo so I got to

524
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,530
like crawl out of the plane and then

525
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:02,060
what if I like scraped my knee on a seat

526
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:05,510
bleeding I'm in the forest you guys do

527
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,790
this like this is this is true I'm not

528
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,140
saying this for because it's funny

529
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,730
whenever I'm like waiting for my flight

530
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,230
and people are like lining up and you

531
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,180
see who's on your flight you guys look

532
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,700
around I look around yeah and I'm like

533
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,350
and I think like if we get started like

534
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,820
if we're like on loss yeah you know I

535
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,740
want that on my tonight yeah I'm like

536
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:26,750
see this guy I know he looks just where

537
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,430
I think about that oh you do everyone

538
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,300
does that and then I think oh that one

539
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:34,850

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,830
that's joking okay well I'm joking good

546
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,600
guys it's a joke

547
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,520
nah David's cannibals leaving in the

548
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,620
college it's I feel like you should

549
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,390
strive to be that guy here for now

550
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,950
everyone's gonna write David David's a

551
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,200
cannibal in the comments but you know

552
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,740
why I just told them - why is that gonna

553
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,940
hurt you

554
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,480
is that gonna hurt your feelings well

555
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,550
it's better

556
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,910
saying that I'm okay David's a

557
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:04,550
cannonball that better get a cannon

558
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,710
cannonball cannibal how about a can of

559
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,810
balls hey I like that one the best

560
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,610
you know what I accept that one more

561
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:13,910
than cannibalism because cannibalism is

562
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:15,740
is very you think just I mean like if

563
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,100
you were in that situation it's not

564
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,080
is it wrong to eat someone if you're I

565
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,860
mean if you're surviving like it's kind

566
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,200
of illegal

567
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,540
I would assume I in some states don't

568
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,510
know the laws on it but I would assume

569
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,490
is like I mean if someone had already

570
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,860
died right I would assume it's probably

571
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:37,130
illegal yeah I would assume so as well

572
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:39,350
I would hope so yeah please don't eat me

573
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,640
but I give you were if you were say you

574
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,540
were surviving on an island and they're

575
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,640
like how did you survive in like

576
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,070
honestly this guy passed away and we

577
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,720
hate him way to jail for that you know

578
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,790
what it's I don't think it's illegal

579
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,830
because I remember no I read an article

580
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,870
I think I was on Vice where a guy had to

581
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,150
get his foot amputated and he did a

582
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,160
tasting for his friends this is a real

583
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,930
thing this is real like yeah she like I

584
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,090
think he cooked he probably cooked it on

585
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,460
like the stove and this is disgusting

586
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:07,070
tapas is disgusting by he going but like

587
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,470
he it's on Vice you could look it up

588
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,650
chopped it off and he did a tasting for

589
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:14,360
his friends and I think he made like he

590
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,040
saw them skewers yeah yeah of course

591
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,760
oh I think they had to sign something

592
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,380
and people ate it his own foot his foot

593
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,180
well it was your own property right he

594
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,470
ate his own foot and I said it's not

595
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,060
illegal and his friends ate his foot

596
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,410
it's not illegal well he had them sign

597
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,870
something maybe that's the legal

598
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,970
document maybe yeah alright so man okay

599
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,160
well now we know okay you're we're sorry

600
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,990
David you can be accountable if you want

601
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,940
you know what Ryan if you had Danah

602
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,860
balls if you hadn't of like a little

603
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,560
tasting event I probably would try a

604
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,510
little piece of your you try my foot as

605
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,230
a friend I would do it why would I'm

606
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,530
doing you a favor

607
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:51,740
you're not eating my foot like would you

608
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:55,370
will would you eat his foot take a taste

609
00:21:51,740 --> 00:22:00,350
no I wouldn't maybe smell it you know

610
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:03,320
what would I eat it I'd probably smell

611
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:06,200
it first you know what you know it's

612
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,910
funny though like I saw that this this

613
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,580
meme it was kind of like where do you

614
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,980
draw the line it's like a picture of

615
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,440
like a dog a cat a cow and he was like a

616
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,180
vegan thing like well yeah you shouldn't

617
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,160
be eating any animals and like where do

618
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,740
you why do we draw the line at like cats

619
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,500
and dogs and domesticated animals

620
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,730
basically like domesticated animal is

621
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,170
yes and then yeah they would live in a

622
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,910
house and you know with human beings you

623
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,830
right so like dogs and cats and like I

624
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:33,550
forget what what else is there like a

625
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:37,000
lizard lizard fish parakeet no parrot

626
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:39,070
fish there on the safe side specific

627
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,100
birds other side of the line there's

628
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,260
cats and dogs hamsters yeah and then

629
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,440
well it made me wonder yeah I mean me

630
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:49,960
wonder like I get we have pets right but

631
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,890
like don't you ever wonder like why

632
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,720
don't we eat dogs and cats and like I

633
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,550
mean like is there there's there actual

634
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,040
reason why that happened over time like

635
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,750
and then why do we eat cows like do you

636
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,520
know I mean that's gonna be like a good

637
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:08,320
sound bite right there why don't want

638
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,880
eat dogs and cats exactly I didn't want

639
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,610
to say that but yeah you know I think

640
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,490
it's more racist stupid racist unlike

641
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,740
how much time throughout like history

642
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,900
we've spent with them and so over time

643
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,910
you know through the domestication of

644
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,190
dogs and stuff yeah since we've spent so

645
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:27,820
much time with them they've left kind of

646
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,620
the realm of our food if that sounds you

647
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,140
know if that's okay to say into the

648
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,900
realm of helping us I think you know

649
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:38,350
companion companions I always thought it

650
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,360
was because they show love like dogs get

651
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:43,570
have like loving like they don't attack

652
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,440
us or cows love do they though dude cows

653
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,640
are freaking cute

654
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,950
they like jump in the air and they

655
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,600
wiggle and they'll cuddle with you do

656
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,820
you have a cow no B never seen like

657
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,980
those videos of like them like being

658
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,840
super cute I lived by a pasture and they

659
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,880
were just smelly and I would feed them

660
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,860
like tea leaves and stuff and I would

661
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,110
keep my distance because they're like

662
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,840
drooling and slimy and there's like

663
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:12,040
thousands of flies on them I think I

664
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:15,070
mean I don't want to sound too I don't

665
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:17,050
know I would assume most animals can

666
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,580
show compassion in one way or at least

667
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,990
we can interpret it in compassion and

668
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,910
then also right they probably learned

669
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,310
that over time I'm sure right like

670
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,500
yeah I think definitely domesticated

671
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:30,040
animals have Early's dogs specifically

672
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,680
have learned and what to do to kind of

673
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,310
make us evil and evolve that way I think

674
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,380
so yeah so a dog who wags its tail

675
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:39,670
that's been bred more than a dog that

676
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,650
doesn't and so that's what has

677
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,570
essentially became like oh they're happy

678
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,910
what I mean is like at what point in

679
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,100
time did they say oh these guys are you

680
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,990
know let's keep this one as a companion

681
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,330
this one's to this wolf that's kind of

682
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:55,120
like a dog is not good like this is not

683
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,420
a good animal too we can still eat that

684
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,570
wolf

685
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,950
that's exactly won't kill this dog why

686
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,660
we have the dogs just because there was

687
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,250
someone that made a decision saying yeah

688
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,660
this dog didn't bite me but maybe it's

689
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,760
because I thought did maybe it's because

690
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,050
dogs they tried it eating them and they

691
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,390
didn't taste good yes I was gonna say

692
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,980
that that's probably that's probably a

693
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,570
big part of it too but there are places

694
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,330
in the world where people still do eat

695
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,340
canine like yes so then my next question

696
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,680
is Asia would you guys eat I mean you

697
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,300
would clearly try dog and cat I don't I

698
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,460
would try I would say what your women

699
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,650
before I would try what other cat you

700
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,160
really is I don't catch that yeah I

701
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,930
don't really believe you there I'm just

702
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,730
like would try I would try it I would

703
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:37,270
try because I'm just a very curious

704
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:40,500
person and look if if in the past if a

705
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:43,210
hundred years ago people you know

706
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,640
humankind survived because they were

707
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,890
eating dogs and cats or whatever animal

708
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,560
for that matter if that was something

709
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,830
that kept them nourished and gave him

710
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,990
energy to to live life and to procreate

711
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:59,440
then you know what I got a respect that

712
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:02,130
and I mean if an alien came down here

713
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,300
and said well you guys eat these large

714
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:07,150
disgusting animals why do you eat a pig

715
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:10,060
that eats its own poop like why are you

716
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,770
eating the these dirty dirty animals you

717
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,510
know an alien could come down and say

718
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,280
that and we wouldn't have a good answer

719
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:18,100
for it I mean we could say it tastes

720
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,170
good but I mean I've never tried dog or

721
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,850
cat so I can't say if it tastes good if

722
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,290
we try and it's really good you know it

723
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:26,560
could be a meow do you think you'd be

724
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:29,800
able to try it um I think if I was in a

725
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,290
dire situation I would but I wouldn't

726
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,919
want to just for the fact of saying that

727
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:37,320
if you know people know that I ate a dog

728
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,710
yeah and I have dogs yeah and I think

729
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,389
that three of us we love dogs I mean I'm

730
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,210
a huge dog lover I like dogs more than

731
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:48,090
people sometimes and like but I would

732
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,889
try it out of respect to those who have

733
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,009
it's like if it's a part of their

734
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:54,830
culture or whatever I would just try it

735
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:57,450
but I wouldn't feel good about it

736
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:59,850
because I love dogs I think they're one

737
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,840
of the best you know things that the

738
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,970
world has to offer

739
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,059
human beings I don't think I could as

740
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,080
much as I kind of want to side on with

741
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,119
what you're saying is like you're

742
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,470
starving well that's completely

743
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,600
different I think I think I had like

744
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,859
that like that the options obviously if

745
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,809
we're a trip or whatever and it was to

746
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:18,269
not disrespect someone or something I'd

747
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:20,489
have to I don't know I'd have to

748
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:23,480
respectfully decline in the most

749
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:26,429
respectable way that's okay it would

750
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,409
yeah yeah I think that's anything that's

751
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:30,090
kind of I think most people wouldn't say

752
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:32,549
that but it's different too because some

753
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:34,019
people think I'm sure there's people

754
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:36,359
places in the world where some people

755
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,429
think how do you eat cows or how do you

756
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,830
eat this you know and there it's on the

757
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:44,369
same side they have either like a

758
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:47,460
religious reason or more some really a

759
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:48,570
reason like of morality right and so I

760
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,399
don't know

761
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,169
Who am I to say that they're strong and

762
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,080
is that culture you know you know

763
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:57,989
actually though when I hear about like

764
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,999
like and see videos of like when those

765
00:27:57,989 --> 00:28:01,859
videos trying to make you a vegan yeah

766
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:03,419
yeah yeah like the I think I I agree

767
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,519
with a lot of their points sure but I

768
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:07,710
think I'm too selfish to give up

769
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,659
something I love that much that's a

770
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,489
super honest thing to say I'd know I

771
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,499
like I agree I'm like this is messed up

772
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,090
what they're doing to these animals but

773
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:17,369
like because I'm not seeing it every day

774
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:21,269
I think that's why like it makes me feel

775
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:24,330
bad right but then I don't change and I

776
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:27,029
think that's selfish but like that's

777
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,659
also part of my upbringing like I wasn't

778
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:29,369
taught this

779
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,629
had I been taught this from when I was a

780
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:32,220
little kid yeah I think it would be

781
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:34,529
different I think I would have grew up

782
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,909
differently I don't know I don't know

783
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:38,639
how you guys feel about that but I feel

784
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:41,039
like that's like I agree actually with a

785
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:42,359
lot of what vegans I know you don't

786
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,980
necessarily think the same way but I

787
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:45,659
agree with a lot of like thought what do

788
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,029
you call those big those far that I

789
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,630
don't know III think it's okay to eat

790
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,760
meat

791
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:55,740
right I don't think it's okay to do what

792
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:59,190
they do to get that me but I know that

793
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,660
it's necessary to keep humans alive yes

794
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,250
and no I would I mean if you look at you

795
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,720
think don't you think it is necessary in

796
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,280
terms of like the food there's already

797
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,470
people starving and if you were to get

798
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:12,930
rid of that yeah I think it's more so at

799
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:16,530
least the way I look at it is just the

800
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:20,250
way that it's there I think there is a

801
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:22,590
morally sound way to like yes yeah yeah

802
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,630
agreed and there are tons it comes to

803
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,670
people to do it yeah but yeah once you

804
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:30,240
start getting at this mass scale a lot

805
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:32,670
of those things that I value they the

806
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,500
importance of them goes down and so I

807
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,880
mean when I comes in like me my own

808
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,030
personal opinion on it I don't really

809
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,400
buy like those you know the the wrapped

810
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:44,270
meats in the store because I really want

811
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:47,460
to have at least some sense of like okay

812
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:49,170
I know where this steak is coming from

813
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,180
alright know like what the conditions

814
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,590
are you know and I think that you know

815
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,840
you have a choice and you're absolutely

816
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:57,390
you're exercising the choice and I think

817
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,190
the markets if enough people make the

818
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,600
same decision that as you do they say I

819
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,550
don't want this like mass-produced

820
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,550
whatever meat I want this meat that was

821
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:07,740
you know where the animals were treated

822
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:09,660
better right I think if more if a lot of

823
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,370
people request that the market will

824
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,200
adjust to it you know before people

825
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,670
didn't care about organic stuff now they

826
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,780
do because people are requesting it and

827
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:22,890
also it's in terms of like the right way

828
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:26,700
of treating animals you know to turn

829
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,990
them into food I think any way you do it

830
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,240
I mean there are better ways and then

831
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:32,370
you know yeah it's not but it's always

832
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,510
yes it's always gonna be brutal at the

833
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,550
end of the day because you're killing an

834
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:38,490
animal sure you look at the animal

835
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:41,850
kingdom you know a tiger you know

836
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:44,670
attacks a deer it's gruesome it's it is

837
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:48,510
oh no and in that's just the circle of

838
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,730
life and you know we need to eat yeah

839
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:54,410
and but the difference is though that

840
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:58,560
the deer has an opportunity to get away

841
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:00,540
right yeah the deer isn't isn't you're

842
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,440
not putting the deer in a cage and then

843
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:05,590
sending a tiger into the K

844
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,420
sure so I mean not that the deer will

845
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,680
get away I'm just saying like it's a

846
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,180
little different because their whole

847
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,340
life I think that's what people are

848
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,820
that's the inhumane part about it it's

849
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,680
like like if they didn't have brains or

850
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,690
thought or feelings or anything I think

851
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,970
it'd be fine for people yeah it was just

852
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,580
a slab of meat that grows bigger with no

853
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:27,100
consciousness but I think a lot of you

854
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,170
know the hardcore vegans you know PETA

855
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,150
they don't even want you to even kill

856
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,530
any animal no yeah I know I know but I

857
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,390
don't I don't necessarily agree with

858
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,010
that but I do agree with it

859
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,420
I mean slaughterhouses and stuff like

860
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,100
that I mean you see that they're not

861
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,720
going through pain and production yeah

862
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,460
so there's better ways you could

863
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,800
probably do that and that's not as

864
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,140
natural but I also understand I've seen

865
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,880
the argument on the other side like what

866
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,830
people would starve yeah I don't know if

867
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,000
that's true but I mean I could pay I

868
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,530
understand yeah it could be

869
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,120
we don't really so the funny thing is

870
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,340
that people get so upset and triggered

871
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,150
over things like this right and that's

872
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,760
why I'm trying to be a little careful

873
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,950
but in all reality and I thought about

874
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,310
this before all these like issues we

875
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:09,430
have with if you really break bring it

876
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:10,630
back to its foundation and I always

877
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,730
think like this is I know it's not good

878
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,950
but if you really bring everything back

879
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,750
in like if there was war if there if

880
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,940
there was chaos if there was an alien

881
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,710
abduction abduction alien invasion and

882
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,110
we're so we're trying to survive

883
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,150
nobody's gonna care like if your people

884
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:27,640
are starving we're just fortunate we're

885
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,260
in a fortunate enough place in life to

886
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,000
worry about these little miniscule

887
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,310
things not saying that it's miniscule

888
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,960
right but like if like [ __ ] was going

889
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,760
down right and everyone's trying to

890
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,250
survive and it's every man for themself

891
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,020
right there's chaos world is ending we

892
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,030
would not those same people would not be

893
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,590
like hey we can't I don't think I don't

894
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,570
think so I don't think they'd be focused

895
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,310
on surviving yeah yessuh cumin need they

896
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,960

just well I mean other than sushi like

1076
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:37,170
what you don't know I know but doesn't

1077
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:39,059
meet is like burgers and like steak

1078
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:43,170
that's true and like covers a much wider

1079
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:44,940
like there's more possible yeah but fish

1080
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:48,299
is healthier for you yeah what would you

1081
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:51,809
choose I don't know that meat guy I do

1082
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:53,250
like me but I do like I mean eating fish

1083
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:54,780
is I feel like it's good for you people

1084
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,549
it is cultures that eat a lot of fish

1085
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,529
are usually pretty live longer

1086
00:39:56,549 --> 00:40:00,689
but the fish that we have now there's

1087
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:03,239
too much mercury in it you think so

1088
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:04,859
for sure like there's a lot of fish in

1089
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,779
every ocean or is it only specific

1090
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:09,359
oceans how do you know I'm not an expert

1091
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:11,429
but I know that when people eat too much

1092
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,529
fish yeah they they get mercury

1093
00:40:11,429 --> 00:40:15,599
poisoning mmm it happens a lot you know

1094
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:17,579
in the same way that like I was saying

1095
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,709
like I don't get to see the negative

1096
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:20,939
parts of like you know like the

1097
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,439
slaughtering of animals all the time so

1098
00:40:20,939 --> 00:40:24,599
I kind of you kind of don't think about

1099
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:26,579
it yeah and you kind of like it's kind

1100
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,660
of selfish but at the same time you it's

1101
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,609
understandable like if you don't see

1102
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,630
something that often you're not gonna be

1103
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:32,130
thinking about it all the time your

1104
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,309
disconnect yeah

1105
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:37,709
so I also heard like back when there was

1106
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:39,179
a tsunami in Japan that you know all

1107
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:40,650
that radioactive material went into the

1108
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:41,670
water and it was constantly spreading

1109
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,779
further and further and further I

1110
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,150
remember like there's said so many years

1111
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:47,309
from now every fish that's important

1112
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,579
from there that you're eating is gonna

1113
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:52,949
be in fact like not in fact radio a

1114
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,959
creation and I remember hearing like

1115
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:56,939
okay this is already happening and I've

1116
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:58,829
been eating fish I haven't changed I

1117
00:40:56,939 --> 00:41:00,089
haven't changed because I haven't but if

1118
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:01,799
I read an article like today I'll

1119
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:03,390
probably like oh maybe I won't eat sushi

1120
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:05,249
today but I'll probably eat it like in

1121
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:08,249
the week yeah it's the same concept it's

1122
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:09,719
like we just forget and like I mean I do

1123
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:11,609
at least that's the power of media I

1124
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:13,709
mean they can you know when you're yeah

1125
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:15,539
you can change corporation like that you

1126
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:17,789
just told people hey this is this is a

1127
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:18,839
story we want to put out we want to put

1128
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:22,049
an emphasis on the fact that we're

1129
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,509
cleaning it up you know the radiation in

1130
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:26,519
the in the ocean as opposed to them

1131
00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:28,049
coming up with the story this radiation

1132
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:31,039
is starting to affect everyone's fish

1133
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:33,779
yeah like that's that's the power that

1134
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,179
like big corporations have yeah and a

1135
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:37,799
separate no but it's related to what

1136
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:39,719
you're talking about earlier is people

1137
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:41,910
don't really care about the lives of

1138
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:43,349
fish which is kind of crazy yeah yeah in

1139
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,329
terms of like when we were tank talking

1140
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:48,209
about drawing the line right animals and

1141
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:49,829
mammals like they're very heavily they

1142
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:51,509
have emotions they have feelings

1143
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:56,900
blah blah blah and that kind of stuff

1144
00:41:51,509 --> 00:42:00,239
right yep fish I don't it's very rare to

1145
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,920
have someone I feel like defend fish in

1146
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,989
that way because like when I started

1147
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,650
fishing that was one thing I was like

1148
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:10,339
how do I dispose of the fish like in a

1149
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:13,549
in a moral way right

1150
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:15,199
and like some people say like hit it

1151
00:42:13,549 --> 00:42:16,999
over the head right and it'll just knock

1152
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,699
its lights out and whether or not that's

1153
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:20,689
you know well or insane however some

1154
00:42:19,699 --> 00:42:24,589
people just throw it in a bucket and

1155
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:27,979
let's let it suffocate I think was water

1156
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:30,109
don't scream or make noise that's yeah I

1157
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:31,789
think that's what it can can't relate to

1158
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:33,439
it as much and they're also in the water

1159
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:35,239
so we don't see them all the time right

1160
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:38,029
as imagine if you if you were to catch a

1161
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:40,099
cow right by shoving a hook through its

1162
00:42:38,029 --> 00:42:41,329
through its mouth and like hooked onto

1163
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,859
its mouth and it was like going crazy

1164
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:43,609
and screaming you'd be like damn this is

1165
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:45,380
hard to watch

1166
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:47,089
yeah with a fish just like oh it's

1167
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,339
flopping around cute you know like oh

1168
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:51,109
you caught a fish yay it's no actually

1169
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:54,619
when I see fish and see the blood coming

1170
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:56,779
out actually I still kind of like feel

1171
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:58,219
bad for oh I do too that knows like when

1172
00:42:56,779 --> 00:43:02,559
I started fishing I kind of was like I

1173
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:05,930
need to figure out a way of like how to

1174
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:09,650
morally dispose after I catch anyone II

1175
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:10,819
want to eat it right yeah I mean if we

1176
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,769
were to ask the fish what do you think

1177
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:15,650
the fish would say what if the fish said

1178
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:17,989
you know actually the best thing for me

1179
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:21,469
is you probably should cut off my fin

1180
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:24,559
first I prefer like it's like it's like

1181
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:26,359
asking someone you know like imagine if

1182
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,640
the fish could talk yeah what if there

1183
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:30,920
is a way to morally do it at the fish

1184
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,150
nose that's the least painful that'd be

1185
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,589
like someone asking you I'm gonna eat

1186
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,329
you what how do you want me to kill you

1187
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:36,890
yeah or is it like brain what if this is

1188
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:39,259
right what if by hitting it in the head

1189
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:40,699
what your being with your act what if

1190
00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:42,650
you're stimulating something in the fish

1191
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:44,989
or like knocking it out but they can

1192
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:48,109
still feel mm-hmm yeah that's scary well

1193
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:50,299
regardless I mean it's I mean I think

1194
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:51,739
it's it people don't feel a certain way

1195
00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:53,390
about fish for that exact reason though

1196
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:54,499
still right or maybe it's a cold-blooded

1197
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:57,259
thing cuz people don't care as much

1198
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:59,539
about reptiles Ulua true yeah get um

1199
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:02,779
cold blood get on and we're cold blooded

1200
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:09,380
damn we gonna wish just grab the fish by

1201
00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:12,140
the sleeves never your eye that was a

1202
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,759
comment you said earlier I'm cold

1203
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,630
yeah we're cold-blooded yeah well I

1204
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:16,369
should have brought that up in the

1205
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,079
beginning one of my favorite comments I

1206
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:19,999
read on one of the last podcast I don't

1207
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,890
remember it specifically but it said

1208
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:23,690
something along the lines of how I

1209
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:25,849
always wear a sweater right

1210
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,950
I like wearing sweaters but and I'm look

1211
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:32,299
cozy and warm and then he pan over a

1212
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:34,130
Ryan sure he's like look sweaty and the

1213
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:35,690
comment was like I just am so confused

1214
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,099
on what the temperature is in this room

1215
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,809
yeah people thought we might be either

1216
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:41,869
in different rooms or how big is this

1217
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:44,150
room like it's not that big once I let

1218
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:47,030
me say is it's cold it is cold here Ryan

1219
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:48,770
can handle the cold like a champion like

1220
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,359
it'll be love that's super cold outside

1221
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,770
he's like wearing a t-shirt I'm like

1222
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:54,740
you're definitely cool he's like no I'm

1223
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:56,299
not I'm sweating yeah always like oh

1224
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,460
what are you trying to be tough no I

1225
00:44:56,299 --> 00:45:00,440
love the code and people like oh where

1226
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,690
are you from like Hawaii and like what

1227
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,430
that doesn't make sense and here's my

1228
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:06,920
explanation for that and you grow up in

1229
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:09,589
Hawaii at least for me I grew up it's so

1230
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,690
hot there right and there's no a/c all

1231
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:13,609
the sweating yeah like all the time most

1232
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:15,109
of the time it's hot and it's the most

1233
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:16,400
uncomfortable thing that it's so like

1234
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:17,809
humid people in Singapore you guys can

1235
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,789
probably relate except you guys are rich

1236
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:22,490
enough to have AC I didn't have AC it

1237
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:23,329
was horrible the only time it felt great

1238
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:25,130
is when you walked into like

1239
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:27,829
supermarkets or like places that were

1240
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:30,349
cold and it was such a luxury I had one

1241
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:32,240
friend who had AC and they were like

1242
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:33,589
rich and I was always like so excited to

1243
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,480
go to their house cuz it was so nice to

1244
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:38,089
just step in there and ever since then I

1245
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,460
guess I grew up just appreciating the

1246
00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:44,059
cold yeah was it a do you think growing

1247
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:47,150
up was it a thing of money to have an AC

1248
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:49,460
or was it just the homes like maybe when

1249
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:51,950
your parents bought homes back in the

1250
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,660
day maybe it was just like people didn't

1251
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:56,720
think they needed AC is because it was

1252
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,730
like cool like I mean we were we were

1253
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,930
like not rich we were like I would say

1254
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,390
like middle-class we weren't poor we

1255
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:03,950
were a middle class I would say and they

1256
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:07,069
still would my parents to say like

1257
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:09,500
that's a waste of money yeah and I

1258
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:12,319
actually ended up I ended up getting

1259
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,720
them AC yeah but my mom was like I don't

1260
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,339
we don't need that room so it's just in

1261
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,619
the living room and in my bedroom so

1262
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:23,150
when I go back check the ones that are

1263
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:25,190
on the wall but it's it's I don't know

1264
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,960
yeah it was still considered I think it

1265
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,700
expensive it's like a waste of money so

1266
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,740
example but it's sobering it was a

1267
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,829
luxury yeah and I think that's why I

1268
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:35,210
love the cold yeah and also I sweat easy

1269
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:36,740
you know what shawne's the same way and

1270
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,340
he's from Hawaii he is I'm onto

1271
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,650
something

1272
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:42,890
damn hey if there are any Hawaiians out

1273
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:45,380
there do you like the cold I mean I

1274
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:46,550
think I think that's I mean that's why

1275
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,850
people think oh you're from Hawaii you

1276
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:52,520
should like the warmth ya know I think

1277
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:54,590
like people who grow up in like really

1278
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,880
cold like Minnesota right you you would

1279
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:57,530
like the warmth because you hate the

1280
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,020
code there right yeah that's why a lot

1281
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:01,460
of people when they move if they move

1282
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,620
from the Midwest or something or

1283
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,940
somewhere where it's really cold they

1284
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,070
have harsh winters they moved like

1285
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,570
California they're like oh my god the

1286
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:11,360
weather I mean it is nice but you

1287
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:12,620
Singaporeans are like me cuz it's so hot

1288
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,480
they just love the cold but the thing is

1289
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,980
they have a/c you might be onto

1290
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,200
something here I might be

1291
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,420
could you imagine not having AC in Las

1292
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,390
Vegas we would probably be dead you die

1293
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:25,970
do you really think about it if if [ __ ]

1294
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:26,510
went down right and electricity got cut

1295
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,490
out

1296
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,020
I think we're dead we were just talking

1297
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,850
about that yeah what would happen like

1298
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:35,390
we would I mean during the summer it

1299
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:36,590
hits like 115 degrees 120 sometimes and

1300
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,420
we're in the middle of the desert like

1301
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:40,700
if there was like a apocalypse right and

1302
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:42,500
we're all locked in here we we'd be dead

1303
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,700
during the summer what would you do

1304
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,220
there's nothing like how would we

1305
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:49,040
survive you would have to find just some

1306
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:51,200
shade or some water or something that's

1307
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,700
what they did back then yeah I mean they

1308
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,930
people didn't want to live and didn't

1309
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,060
live in the desert back then we got

1310
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:57,290
tricked into living out here people do I

1311
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:59,810
mean that's how we're that's how

1312
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:01,790
humanity you know came living with us

1313
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,080
today well they had to live through it I

1314
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,160
mean I mean they went through it but

1315
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,340
they're not like hey let's settle right

1316
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,020
here and it all shows the human spirit

1317
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:12,170
I wonder how fast we could adjust our

1318
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:14,600
that we have like a kid who was born

1319
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:16,400
into a climate and then it raised their

1320
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,290
whole life but if if all of a sudden

1321
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,220
everything just like all our luxuries

1322
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:21,380
got shut off

1323
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,480
I wonder how fast we would adjust to

1324
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,610
like our environment and would we evolve

1325
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,770
as humans would the the next generation

1326
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:29,870
of kids be have like really hot skin oh

1327
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:32,000
and their well their body temperatures

1328
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:35,420
would be at naturally at 105 Oh

1329
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,370
instead of 98.6 I don't know damn we'll

1330
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,660
never know I don't know why I brought

1331
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:40,130
that up oh you know why I brought that

1332
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:43,460
up that's because we were listening to a

1333
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:45,560
book called CD games and that was I was

1334
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,780
pretty um highly recommend it was a long

1335
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,280
drive it was really cool it was super

1336
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,870
interesting it was good but if you would

1337
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,790
have saw us

1338
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:54,170
from an outside perspective like three

1339
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,090
guys just sitting there listening to

1340
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,920
this book that sounds like a British

1341
00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:01,460
lecture from like a college you'd be

1342
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,710
like oh let's get doing we do for fun we

1343
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,690
were like genuinely into it no I mean I

1344
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:07,490
thought it was super super intriguing

1345
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:08,750
that was really cool and I and then made

1346
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:10,190
me think like when people listen to this

1347
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:13,280
podcast they're not really getting that

1348
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:14,900
much right like we're just talking about

1349
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,150
like I learned a lot what did you learn

1350
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:21,260
lean one thing you learned from this

1351
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:23,720
podcast see maybe we need to start like

1352
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:25,280
going at school reading more yeah become

1353
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,440
scholars you know we should do is listen

1354
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,690
to more like educational stuff and then

1355
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,360
will regurgitate in a dumb way for dumb

1356
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:34,520
people because I don't like listening to

1357
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,530
smart people talk it gets boring you

1358
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,810
know because I'm not smart my first

1359
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:46,190
lesson today two plus two equals four I

1360
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:48,350
mean when I say dumb I mean like thanks

1361
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:51,080
for coming to my TED talk when I said no

1362
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:53,450
I don't mean like we don't think I just

1363
00:49:51,080 --> 00:50:00,710
mean we're not necessarily Harvard grads

1364
00:49:53,450 --> 00:50:02,930
yeah you know like yeah duh you dropped

1365
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,730
out right so yeah I got accepted to USC

1366
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:07,250
and I was gonna go for music business

1367
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:09,050
right and then that was a time I got

1368
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,240
signed to a publishing deal for at a

1369
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:13,640
company called warner/chappell music and

1370
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,500
I ate so I chose that and I dropped out

1371
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,480
because I wanted to pursue YouTube mhm

1372
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:20,780
and will dropped out as well you did

1373
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:26,450
yeah we are three dumb dummies and then

1374
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:29,300
we're the bird themed boys anyone's

1375
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:31,640
listening to right now we will do our

1376
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,910
best to get more educational things and

1377
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:37,040
dumb it down for you naturally I thought

1378
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:40,070
you guys are dumb it's cuz we're dumb we

1379
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:42,770
are dumb yeah but we'll make it fun try

1380
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:46,640
it so what do we learn from sapiens that

1381
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:49,940
humans are strong that's not oh you mean

1382
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,250
the the book yeah I feel like I learned

1383
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:55,820
actually a lot I nearly thought about

1384
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:57,920
how there was multiple species of like

1385
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:01,280
quote-unquote humans that one yeah I

1386
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,740
think that one yeah and then what we are

1387
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,460
today is Homo sapiens but there was like

1388
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,140
the Neander

1389
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,910
dolls or Neanderthals that's how you

1390
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:10,130
pronounced it yeah and like all these

1391
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:11,930
other ones and we know ones that

1392
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:14,540
survived yeah we don't really know I

1393
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:16,310
don't think how we became the last ones

1394
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,440
to survive there he was definitely pecks

1395
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:19,820
predators yeah he was saying that could

1396
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,790
have been like we could have hope

1397
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:25,010
extinguished that or iPhone in time Oh

1398
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:26,870
was that because and this is the this is

1399
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,370
the only thing I really took a not that

1400
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:29,990
I to only took away this but I thought

1401
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:33,080
it was so interesting that how he was

1402
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:35,900
saying we've evolved so that our brains

1403
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:38,650
are bigger than like Apes right and the

1404
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:41,360
reason the reason why we're so weak is

1405
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:43,430
because our brains are so big and it

1406
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,530
requires so much energy we compared to

1407
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,340
the the chimpanzees and the Apes they're

1408
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:49,040
exactly yeah

1409
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:51,470
yeah and he was saying that um and what

1410
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,300
what made us talk he didn't say this

1411
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,700
this is or us you know hearing that and

1412
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,650
going on you know how they draw aliens

1413
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,390
and they show aliens like your

1414
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:01,580
stereotypical alien has a gigantic head

1415
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:04,580
and a smaller body right and you know

1416
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:07,340
you know that's your stereotypical alien

1417
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,870
a small body gigantic head at least

1418
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,800
that's what we hear it if you think

1419
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:12,460
about it what if they're just the

1420
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:15,020
evolved versions of humans because I

1421
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:16,310
mean there's a conspiracy theory already

1422
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,710
that that's what it is

1423
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:21,020
yeah aliens are just super evolved

1424
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:22,700
humans as you see time it's like my

1425
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:25,430
favorite yeah it's like battle of the

1426
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:28,310
minds as opposed to physical story right

1427
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:30,020
which is like what animals have - it's

1428
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:33,020
all based off of speed and strength

1429
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:35,060
right right with human beings we've come

1430
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,590
to evolve to become a society where we

1431
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,030
don't need to actually physically fight

1432
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:40,130
yeah because we're smart

1433
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:42,200
these are dominant we have we learn that

1434
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:44,960
our brains make us the most powerful

1435
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,300
thing because we can shoot we invented

1436
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,280
guns we can shoot an ape whereas if we

1437
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,510
didn't have if we're going one-on-one in

1438
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,460
the physical battle that hate would tear

1439
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:54,530
us apart yeah but because of our brains

1440
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,240
is the most powerful gift that's but

1441
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,890
that also is why we're so physically

1442
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,540
weak there's no thing that's as strong

1443
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,370
as an ape and as smart as a human

1444
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,530
because it would be too much energy to

1445
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:06,350
repower that brain yeah something like

1446
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:07,100
that yeah so what if so aliens you know

1447
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:10,010
what that means

1448
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,840
well kick some alien ass physically but

1449
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:15,280
then they'd probably have super guns and

1450
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,280
then super shoot us

1451
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,300
yeah I mean for all we know they're

1452
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,010
already we're already in they're gone

1453
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:24,290
we're in their world that they created

1454
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:32,240
that's like her dummy Homo Sapien way

1455
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:33,500
they got super gonna shoot us you know

1456
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,720
what we're bringing we're gonna listen

1457
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:38,570
to more and we will update you guys I

1458
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,760
think it's been like yeah I really think

1459
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:42,890

1460
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,090

1461
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:46,490

00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:49,670
yes guys leave some negative comments

1463
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:54,860
for David please was it David cannibal

1464
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:56,720
cannibal I'm just a sack of canned balls

1465
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,450
you didn't have to take it there but

1466
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,680
alright sorry guys I really think we

1467
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:02,480
should we should learn more so that we

1468
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,160
can be we gotta get better at this we

1469
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,800
got to have you got to help educate our

1470
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:10,780
listeners yeah I realize I feel like uh

1471
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:13,730
as we do the podcast I realize that

1472
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,950
being able to like conversate and watch

1473
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,690
it back it's pretty crazy like how you

1474
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:21,080
say like I feel like Paco naturally is a

1475
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:22,550
good comping a conversation and speaking

1476
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:25,460
and something that I loves to talk he

1477
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:27,230
loves to talk and I feel like it's it's

1478
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,360
hard it's a hard to generate entertainer

1479
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:31,400
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's is that's why

1480
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,230
I mean that's out of everybody in noir

1481
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,480
hpc I was like he needs to be on it cuz

1482
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:37,190
this is his gift yes not necessarily

1483
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,840
like oh I'll write a skit for him sure

1484
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,280
he'll do it he's he would want to do it

1485
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:43,460
his own way but when he's just being him

1486
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,170
like that's best yeah not when he's like

1487
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,550
not trying to make you laugh it's funny

1488
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,720
to me and you can see it through the

1489
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,490
podcasts because that's essentially what

1490
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,720
I think he would love to hear us saying

1491
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,750
this type of thing forward

1492
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,390
he ain't gonna watch this you think you

1493
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:58,130
need to watch this he I don't think you

1494
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:59,450
I mean if he does he knows that we're

1495
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:01,790
ending since he probably would have

1496
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:03,380
skipped it like the ending alright miss

1497
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:05,210
you Paco you're a great person

1498
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:07,730
yeah he's well he comes back tomorrow

1499
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,500
from Japan yeah or not tomorrow I guess

1500
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:12,380
when this comes out he just came back

1501
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:16,340
yep um I guess yeah what that being said

1502
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:17,990
and wrap this up but I do think man I

1503
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,040
wish and we brought this up earlier what

1504
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:20,660
huh

1505
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,580
the whole alien thing because I think

1506
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,820
that's we're on to something I think so

1507
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,050
too

1508
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,540
and I don't think we're the first one

1509
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:27,890
because I've seen something similar I

1510
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,870
just don't remember the videos and you

1511
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:30,289
can continue this in the next episode I

1512
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:32,869
know

1513
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:34,669
off the pill I like to use topics with

1514
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:36,559
David because David I know he thinks

1515
00:55:34,669 --> 00:55:36,859
about these he's more skeptical than I

1516
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,989
am

1517
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:40,459
yeah and he brings like that a nice side

1518
00:55:38,989 --> 00:55:42,349
of that I mean I'm pretty skeptical too

1519
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:43,819
though but I like to have fun with it

1520
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:45,169
