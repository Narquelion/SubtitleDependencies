1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,790
the fact that we're talking about

Willie sauce all right what song is that

40
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,060
I don't know where that came from

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:23,569
looks like Paramore um we do not have a

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,959
sponsor today but you know what cool huh

43
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:30,040
doing way way oh nice too late yeah but

44
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,170
I guess what could be a fake sponsor is

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,410
your foundation yep I'm going right in

46
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,209
today yes I do have a nonprofit that I

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,290
don't remember when that video came out

48
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,260
it was on second Channel something

49
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:45,590
usable two years ago cuz I'll still it

50
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:48,220
wasn't anyway a lot of people don't know

51
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,090
about it but the idea kind of came from

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,660
it's kind of like a make-a-wish

53
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:56,720
Foundation but instead of sick kids it's

54
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,980
going towards the caregivers so it's

55
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,330
almost like without them knowing so it's

56
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,660
instead of making a wish it's like

57
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,580
giving somebody an unexpected surprise

58
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,860
yeah like someone who's selfless yeah so

59
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,989
the first one we did was this girl that

60
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,780
we heard about through a well my mom

61
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:15,440
heard about through a newspaper back in

62
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,910
Hilo and she was like this she just does

63
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,299
everything she's part of the Peace Corps

64
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,799
and she uh just like right out of high

65
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,600
school she went to like Africa to help

66
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,489
spread like AIDS awareness and stuff

67
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,290
like that she was a beast basically she

68
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,940
did so many things it seems unrealistic

69
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,239
it's like this is too good of a person

70
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,500
so she was our first person that we you

71
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,209
know did something for and then we

72
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,459
talked to her mom secretly this is

73
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,430
basically how it works we reach out to

74
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:42,769
you know a friend or a family member who

75
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,480
wants to nominate this person obviously

76
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,579
they didn't know about the foundation so

77
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,739
we didn't wait for someone to nominate

78
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:51,230
we had to like basically just go and

79
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,370
find the mom and we secretly talked to

80
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,510
her and said is there anything we want

81
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,880
to do this best day ever

82
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,109
that's what the foundation is called so

83
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,430
that's not what it's called that's what

84
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:01,000
the show was called the foundation is

85
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,650
the Ryan Higa foundation org and

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,889
essentially we reached out and we found

87
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,959
out that she needed a car she didn't ask

88
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,000
for it she didn't even the mom didn't

89
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,470
even ask for it but she said is theirs

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
we said is there something that your

91
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,070
daughter is gonna need cuz she's going

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,539
off to college and really what she

93
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,500
needed was a car so we ended up getting

94
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:23,330
our car but that's just one example not

95
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,550
saying we're gonna go and help cars to

96
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,229
everybody but if you're out there and

97
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,729
you know somebody who's like done a lot

98
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:30,530
of good things or you just really want

99
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:31,070
them to have their best day ever go to

100
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,770
Ryan Higa

101
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,140
foundation org yeah nominate them and

102
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,270
there's a video don't remember what it's

103
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,340
called or older huh what's the video

104
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,090
called on Technol it's well the show's

105
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,280
best day ever

106
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,840
cuz your idea is to give somebody who

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,700
deserves it their best day ever

108
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,890
not that getting a car is her best day

109
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,229
ever but it's just the show know what uh

110
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,960
like what would qualify someone this is

111
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:57,530
somebody who like you know work hard or

112
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,640
make edits podcasts and you know yeah I

113
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:04,130
mean if they're a good person

114
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,750
sure they've done beyond he's a good

115
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,880
person I'm out you if they go above and

116
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,990
beyond like like a like a teacher you

117
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,789
know you hear those stories like the

118
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,250
teachers always they're broke but they

119
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:14,539
spend all their money to their salary on

120
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,130
it it's kind of kind of like those

121
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:17,659
typical shows you see on like the news

122
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,460
you know how they do like those segments

123
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:20,539
where they surprised people yeah but I'm

124
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,110
trying to turning into a show at the

125
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:23,870
same time

126
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,150
yeah that's cool that's cool so I mean

127
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,610
we just need nominations to find good

128
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,150
people you have to be 13 at least or

129
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,700
older than obviously to nominate legal

130
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,110
reasons and then right as of now I think

131
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,250
it's only in the US the the nominee

132
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,870
nominate from wherever you are but the

133
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,180
nominee should be in the US just for now

134
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,450
okay we're not big enough yet very cool

135
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,250
super cool yeah anyway off from the

154
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,440
scariest games it's meant to be scared

155
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,110
you take you go around basically and you

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,250
it's not meant for kids I don't think I

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,570
do remember that was really scary yeah

159
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,940
it was a fun group game to play with

160
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:48,120
people mm-hmm I like I don't know maybe

161
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,590
that's where my my enjoyment of seeing

162
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,910
other people scream it scary movies

163
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,680
comes from were you the one playing it

164
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,510
or just wanting to do as a group huh did

165
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,210
you play it or watch it like when both

166
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,590

scared not necessarily but I mean I

172
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,140
don't a lot of people like those

173
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,490
compilations of people getting scared

174
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,800
you don't watch those videos and think

175
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,120
it's funny no I don't it depends on the

176
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,490
reaction yeah they could be pretty funny

177
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,050
I don't I don't usually watch those it's

178
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,940

conjuring it's good okay that's a good

183
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,430
movie yeah but you just always like

184
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,690
anytime you go and see a scary movie you

185
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,250
always invite the whole group you like

186
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,080
anybody wanted to watch this movie

187
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,290
Greg's always like just doesn't respond

188
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,760
or something yeah but I mean it's it's

189
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,180
just the kind of movies I like oh yeah

190
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,070
sure do you uh anything wrong with that

191
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,050
or weird about it dude a lot of people

192
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,200
like scary movies I like scary movies I

193
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,020
do want to figure out why I get that

194
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,880
enjoyment though I go into scary movies

195
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,160
and I base how good it is based on like

196
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,330
man I actually felt something I like to

197
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,020
feel something when I watch movie

198
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,980
whether it's happiness sadness or if a

199
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,900
movie makes you feel something it's a

200
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,010
good movie yeah and it's really hard for

201
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,290
you especially according to the last

202
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,940
podcast yeah you're a robot that is not

203
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,710
true

204
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,720
but it is but if something makes if a

205
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,550
movie makes me feel anything I think

206
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,780
it's a good movie

207
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,790
that means I got sucked into it yeah

208
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,000
it's probably also with scary movies is

209
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,650
if you actually feel scared when you'd

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,090
like don't expect it or ever because

211
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,590
it's easy for like like you were saying

212
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,270
or I remember we talked about this a

213
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,200
long time ago we're like jump scares are

214
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,630
kind of like the easy way out

215
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,000
yeah but when the movies use all their

216
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,770
like tricks to make you feel scared yeah

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,660
that's when you're like whoa it's the

218
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,980
building of the anxiety yeah it's not

219
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,230
really the actual jump scare

220
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,720
at I mean that's just like the that's

221
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,370
like a fart joke in comedy it's like the

222
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,050
easiest way to get a laugh or do the

223
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:58,240
screech that makes both you guys laugh

224
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:59,650
no but like jump scares you you told me

225
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,180
this and this is how he kind of

226
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,520
convinced me to go watch more scary

227
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,410
movies Ryan was like horror and comedy

228
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,510
have a lot in common because those are

229
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,330
the only two genres that rely heavily on

230
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,770
timing heavily yeah yeah it they're all

231
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,260
about timing and that's why kind of

232
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:16,360
Jordan peels movies have like exactly

233
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,680
done so well I mean he's like he's a

234
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,940
comedic genius yeah

235
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,230
and he's able to translate that into

236
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,090
like horror so maybe you want to talk

237
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,350
about a little bit cuz that's actually

238
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,800
something that you're interested in yeah

239
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,390
I mean I from even before get out you

240
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,760
know it inspired me but B even before

241
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,260
that I was like I've alway mean you guys

242
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,160
know I've always like people ask me all

243
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,810
you want to make a movie

244
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,160
my natural gut is to go and make a

245
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,190
horror movie that's what I would have

246
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,900
want to create more so than like a

247
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,910
comedy movie because the only reason is

248
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,670
because I feel like it's so similar in

249
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,310
terms of timing and it's something new

250
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,420
yeah and I feel like it's it's fun to do

251
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,770
I don't know maybe something is wrong

252
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,250
with me Alex just carefully I like to

253
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,750
give people

254
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,580
I don't know increase their heart rates

255
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,990
I don't know what it is mmm something's

256
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,170
wrong with me dude you should make human

257
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:08,020
centipede for is there a third one there

258
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:10,750
is a third one oh my man if people who

259
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,630
have not seen it don't not one of the

260
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,300
ones that I think is considered a great

261
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,460
horror movie but it's great shock value

262
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,450
do you remember playing scary games

263
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,130
growing up

264
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,480
scary games what yeah like like you were

265
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,190
saying with the fatal friend do you

266
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,830
remember that that was the only one man

267
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,290
it wasn't like your genre you play games

268
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:32,290
oh there wasn't many I mean Resident

269
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:39,460
Evil did you get scared of Diablo first

270
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:41,500
time you play oh no did you remember the

271
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,730
first boss the butcher yeah I had to

272
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,210
have my brother come to kill him cuz I

273
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,510
was scared

274
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:49,800
yeah he was scary I guess I don't know

275
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:52,660
something about I don't know I wasn't in

276
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,060
film at the time or wasn't into making

277
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,750
videos yeah but like it's easier now

278
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,020
because when

279
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,820
watch those horror movies or like it

280
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,580
not just horror movies anything that

281
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,660
takes you out of the film like a horror

282
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,300
movie or something that you're really

283
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,590
into it's hard for me to not picture how

284
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,570
they're filming it if that makes sense

285
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,800
yeah yeah like if there's a shot where

286
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,930
it's just like in the music's building

287
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,340
I'm picturing like the editor damn why

288
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,200
are they turning up their volumes so

289
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,760
high right here obviously something's

290
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,080
gonna happen if not they're gonna cut to

291
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,300
something else and then like I'm already

292
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,800
pre-planning so many steps ahead because

293
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,680
I'm trying to picture how their timeline

294
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,790
looks like yeah and it's so not fun but

295
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,840
if there's a really good movie that

296
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,040
sucks me in that I don't think about

297
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,050
that stuff yeah

298
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,090
that's on you I don't know that makes

299
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,920
sense I that's the only way I can try to

300
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,240
get out of movies cuz I get sucked in

301
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,160
very easily that's why I don't like

302
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,260
watching scary movies cuz even though I

303
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,330
know it's not real mm-hmm like I'll just

304
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,730
be like oh it immersed yeah I get super

305
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,990
like just I'm in it that's why that's

306
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,030
that's why I like when we talked about

307
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,590
it last time when I had to go oh dude

308
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,910
that's the only way I can get out at

309
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,140
them verbally say something to be like

310
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,240
I'm in a movie I'm in a movie

311
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,250
get me out of here like after the

312
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,160
conjuring when I went to the cloud yeah

313
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:06,010
I turned all the lights on yeah wasted

314
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,600
your electricity dude I turned like Ryan

315
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,339
you made me see this movie after I

316
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,320
didn't make you it's fun no I don't you

317
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,110
you don't regret it no I don't because

318
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,450
there's a good story really good yeah it

319
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,390
was it was funny though even like when I

320
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,790
watch dude you and Arden are probably

321
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,610
like the worst people or or best

322
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,680
depending on which to see horror movies

323
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,690
with because that's what scares me is

324
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,790
you guys person who next to you that

325
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,070

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,480
grabbed no but you'll yell I will you'll

328
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,650
yell and it's I like kind of get a

329
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,140
little bit mad cuz I'm like that's not

330
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,030
part of the scare but like it scares me

331
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,190
and I'm like that's not that shouldn't

332
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:49,170
happen that's a jump scare you know how

333
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,170

scary than the movie yeah and it's a

336
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,420
little upsetting cuz you're like man

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,670
of videos talking about how he employed

362
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,440
artists who were trying to make it but

363
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,670
also needed money so this is how this is

364
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,070
how they would hustle this is how they

365
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,900
would grind and his mindset was just

366
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:07,120
about like bringing like positivity and

367
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:08,350
stuff and a quote actually I mean he had

368
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,750
such an impact on the community that

369
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,340
mark ride Lee Thomas hope it's how I

370
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,170
said his name is a member of the Los

371
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,640
Angeles County Board of Supervisors who

372
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,920
represents the southern part of the city

373
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,730
released a statement Sunday night saying

374
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,100
his district mourn the loss of hustle oh

375
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,870
dude I'm gonna butcher his name I know I

376
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,450
just saw that it was like oh I can't

377
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:33,130
wait to part mice - I don't know known

378
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,390
to us as the hip-hop artists Nipsey

379
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,250
Hussle was a father businessman

380
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,460
entertainer and an inspiration to many

381
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,110
with really Tommy so this is a common I

382
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,520
mean this is like a common thing that is

383
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,610
this is why I heard of him because every

384
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,530
celebrity not every majore him his

385
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,960
celebrities came out and they they were

386
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,760
showing like such respect and like such

387
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,990
I mean you know they do that a lot times

388
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,940
when people pass away but yeah it was

389
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,310
like a consensus like this is such a

390
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,780
good guy he you know naturally I'm gonna

391
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,840
look him up I looked him up I saw all

392
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,980
the great things he did but there was

393
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,660
also something that just

394
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,670
right before the podcast I wasn't even

395
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,470
searching conspiracy or anything but

396
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,839
this thing popped up on my Facebook

397
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,399
Timeline and it was a conspiracy about

398
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,990
his death and I'm like oh here we go

399
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,160
again just cuz someone dies and gets

400
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,170
shot it doesn't mean there's a

401
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,480
conspiracy mm-hmm but then I looked into

402
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,160
it you know I love my conspiracies you

403
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,829
love them and there's you know what

404
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,709
there is I mean I I haven't done enough

405
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:28,750
research of something I'm gonna say how

406
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:30,399
do I give a disclaimer like don't take

407
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,420
everything I say as a fact but take you

408
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,720
know a grain of salt

409
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:37,060
take it with a grain of sugar I don't

410
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,829
know why I changed it anyway if you look

411
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,540
at the conspiracy in super inch I only

412
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:43,060
looked it up for like an hour so I don't

413
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,160
don't um don't knock me if I get it

414
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,570
wrong yeah our own research essentially

415
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,279
yeah do your own research but from what

416
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,480
I've read and I've only checked it sites

417
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,029
obviously they could be wrong and they

418
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,040
could be saying the same thing yeah the

419
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:55,389
conspiracy was that he was releasing a

420
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,139
documentary or making a documentary

421
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:02,170
about this doctor doctor said dr. Seuss

422
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:03,970
Abbey who claims that he got a or he

423
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,120
created a cure for AIDS I don't think

424
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,010
it's claimed he actually proved it in a

425
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,040
95 yeah okay well he proved it that he

426
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,660
has a cure for AIDS and HIV right you

427
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,930
know in a court I don't know about HIV I

428
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,440
think just AIDS isn't that the same age

429
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:22,029
any leads to AIDS no well we just doing

430
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,310
okay I think it was oh it could be eight

431
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,860
well regardless it's everybody knows we

432
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,800
we know aids as being incurable right

433
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,850
but he has proven that it was C I don't

434
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,860
even know if I can say that it was

435
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,240
proven I don't know the article said

436
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,670
that okay so it's not us we're reporting

437
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,310
what we saw yes cured AIDS essentially

438
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:42,459
and everybody knows I mean in the whole

439
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,170
especially the conspiracy world people

440
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,899
know that if you if you just like curing

441
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:49,690
cancer or hearing aids like selling the

442
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:51,010
treatment is a lot more profitable than

443
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,449
selling a cure because then you get to

444
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,480
build them every step of the way yeah

445
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:58,569
you know there's always that conspiracy

446
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,510
and basically there's there's I'm gonna

447
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:02,920
give that really yeah that's crazy yeah

448
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,390
there I mean like people talk about oh

449
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,040
there's been a cure for cancer it's just

450
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,260
that it makes so much money treating

451
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,760
walls than it does curing them they're

452
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,829
the pharmaceutical companies make more

453
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,299
money off of a country being sick than a

454
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,040
country being wealthy or a healthy

455
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,960
healthy arm it's all the pharmaceutical

456
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,280
side

457
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,810
could be maybe you know I mean they

458
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,460
could have investment you and me on the

459
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,540
conspiracy I'm telling you you do you

460
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,070
should look into it you don't have to

461
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,050
necessarily believe everything with a

462
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,720
grain of sugar and just like you know

463
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:31,390
look it up and but basically there's

464
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,620
there's more to it but you told me some

465
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,780
stuff that was interesting you brought

466
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,450
up about I was just talking to you

467
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:41,710
before this went live there is another

468
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:43,780
artist by so essentially um in the

469
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,030
article that I had read dr. stubby and

470
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,740
this is up that I've heard even before

471
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,620
this event right but doctor said we had

472
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,880
found a cure and he got stopped like at

473
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,910
an airport or something I think in

474
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,220
Honduras and basically he got stopped

475
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:01,000
for having too much money on him right

476
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:03,190
and then he got detained and while in

477
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,760
custody he died three days later due to

478
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:09,580
fighting a battle with pneumonia but the

479
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,550
the big conspiracy is how could one of

480
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,010
the world's most healthy men suddenly

481
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,860
died to pneumonia within three days so a

482
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,280
lot of people are draw up the idea of he

483
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,180
was executed you know possibly

484
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,700
conspiracy yeah there's there's no

485
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,550
actual evidence right and then I believe

486
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,970
there's an artist by the name of left

487
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:32,230
eye or something yeah it's a woman yeah

488
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,760
what did she do she she was talking

489
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,530
basically talking talking about it and

490
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:42,790
trying to bring awareness turnabout from

491
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:45,970
TLC but she essentially from what I read

492
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:49,210
again that much I probably look more

493
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,220
into it but she was murdered as well

494
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,990
right oh well she wasn't murdered she

495
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,790
was in a car crash a car crash but

496
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,080
people again suspect because she was

497
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,000
talking about and bringing awareness to

498
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,400
it and then this whole thing happened

499
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,740
because you know named she also was

500
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,100
making a documentary that's yeah yeah oh

501
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,980
Lisa left eye Lopes hmm good for you you

502
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:12,130
know you're so hip I know some things

503
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,500
about the culture but yet so that this

504
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,450
whole thing came up and it's very

505
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:21,220
regardless it's a little suspicious yeah

506
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:22,780
and he also has a quote I believe that

507
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,660
people have been tweeting and stuff

508
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,440
saying that uh what was the exact quote

509
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,080
I have it somewhere

510
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,799
it's basically he said if I if they kill

511
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,989
me for

512
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,970
documentary or he says here it is if

513
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:36,039
they kill me for this documentary y'all

514
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,779
better ride for me not that I really

515
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:40,480
know one ride for me means what is right

516
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:42,759
for me me and Barry down for me like

517
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,830
they know what I was about you better

518
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:49,629
ride for me maybe she's like maybe like

519
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:51,879
put keep pushing it so I saw that Nick

520
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:53,019
Cannon actually instagrammed it or

521
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:55,360
something that he's saying he's gonna

522
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:59,080
finish the documentary yeah and I'm like

523
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,239
dude mmm that's date like and Twitter

524
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,070
was like protect me again yeah and all

525
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:05,139
this stuff like but if you have to go

526
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,850
about it though I mean like you would

527
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:08,470
say publicly you're gonna finish the

528
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,279
documentary people know if something

529
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,470
happens to him we know it it is like

530
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,179
there's still no way to prove it though

531
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,950
so I wonder this is kind of like not a

532
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,749
side thing but has there ever been a

533
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,119
conspiracy that was like pretty big that

534
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:24,730
actually got proven in it transferred

535
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:26,700
from conspiracy theory to fact and then

536
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,950
action was taken has that ever happened

537
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,629
I'm sure I'm sure there has been maybe

538
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:36,249
when everybody thought the world was

539
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:37,809
flat in nineteen of 1492 yeah everything

540
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:38,379
was a conspiracy at some point right

541
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:40,509
mm-hmm

542
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:42,609
yeah I mean like more like in modern

543
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:44,889
modern times where maybe someone was

544
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:46,929
like it became it was a known conspiracy

545
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:48,489
and then either something came out or

546
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:50,679
someone proved it well this is what

547
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:52,450
happened just see small it right it was

548
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:53,859
a conspiracy at first a lot of people

549
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,859
were saying what that doesn't sound

550
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:59,049
realistic that sounds like he staged it

551
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:00,879
mmm even before he the facts came out

552
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,909
right true people were saying that and

553
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:06,220
then you know a couple weeks later he

554
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,539
gets caught or they find like his I

555
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,159
don't know I don't know I don't know how

556
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:12,039
it went down exactly but all these other

557
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,450
facts came out yeah and but it's like

558
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,799
those are like a small like a small

559
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,600
example of that I think you're talking

560
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,460
about like a grand scale like worldwide

561
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,259
yeah or even something that is like what

562
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,710
government you know so they've been it's

563
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:25,809
like okay if it if it is like let's say

564
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,999
let's even say like God forbid I hope

565
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:29,799
not you know Nick Cannon whatever yeah

566
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:32,470
they get they get him they get off on

567
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:34,269
that would real quick they get him right

568
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,100
and maybe even has like a note it says

569
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:38,679
like they came in Bob I was a government

570
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:42,850
like then what do you do

571
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,750
did someone else call the police someone

572
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,370
else carries on

573
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,630
cuz they I think when Nick Cannon said

574
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,340
it was like I'll take the baton from

575
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,680
here so it's almost as this like it's a

576
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,390
relay you know one person like you know

577
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,500
I don't know I don't even know what I'm

578
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,820
trying to ask but it's like I know what

579
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,270
you're saying what's the next like how

580
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:01,090
do you how do you find you'll see people

581
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:04,090
yeah pursue and make sure you know those

582
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:07,360
people are you got it somebody you got

583
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,400
to get somebody with in power yeah to be

584
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,640
a conspiracy there is to be like to

585
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,750
pursue it yeah but also what person

586
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,670
morality yeah but the thing is it's like

587
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,190
a you're basically in like a loophole

588
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,130
because that person loophole what is it

589
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,990
called where's the word I'm thinking oh

590
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,460
not conundrum either but basically that

591
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,350
person who makes it that way into power

592
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,650
your isn't gonna make it there without

593
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,150
playing ball yeah you know yeah so

594
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,520
that's why I think those things never

595
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,290
come out yeah is even if somebody who if

596
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,910
I all of a sudden I believe in

597
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,130
conspiracy theory is certain ones on all

598
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,710
of them if I were to somehow magically

599
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:44,200
make it into a position of power a

600
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,720
president right I'm not gonna make it

601
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,530
there by saying hey I wonder if the

602
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,180
Clintons murdered something something

603
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:54,040
they're not gonna let me rise into power

604
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,930
with that kind of thinking I say so I

605
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,550
think it's there's no way really to

606
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,230
expose those kind of like no completely

607
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,820
innocent person can rise to that I'm

608
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,370
right amount of power and then they make

609
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,050
a non in the way on the on the journey

610
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,820
there they make you seem like a crazy

611
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,470
person already when you say conspiracy

612
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,240
theorist you're thinking all this guy

613
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,320
believes in Flat Earth or has nothing to

614
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,230
do yeah exactly

615
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:18,160
but like aliens are we're not gonna get

616
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:23,350
into that but yeah aliens are not a

617
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:28,900
conspiracy alright are we going just

618
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:30,550
talk for Derek I'm so excited I can't

619
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,410
wait to talk about all his alien stories

620
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,270
that's pretty crazy how like you

621
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,460
literally it was like overnight that all

622
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,560
these conspiracies like just exploded no

623
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,640
no no it's been around for a while but

624
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,900
the fact that he was pursuing this

625
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,810
documentary more people were like

626
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:47,920
exactly this is adding on to it oh yeah

627
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:49,480
I think even more like suspect mostly I

628
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,490
think he could have easily just been

629
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,260
another shooting but like where normally

630
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,000
when those happen like especially to

631
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,260
celebrities yeah if you find out oh they

632
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,960
caught the killer or they killed the kid

633
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,670
yeah I didn't

634
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,310
anything I think supposedly also it was

635
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,450
like on his turf in his area yeah you

636
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,950
know and how could people have done that

637
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,100
and just gotten out you know that

638
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:09,260
quickly the turf was healing he he was

639
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,430
in like I believe something something

640
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,740
you know some I don't I don't know what

641
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,970
it is it's I don't want to say anything

642
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,040
I'm wrong but it was something

643
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,560
gang-related and then he also was

644
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,020
meeting with someone I think whoever

645
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,130
that police officer whatever it is not

646
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,990
the officer the guy you were talking

647
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:27,770
about using the rolling sixties

648
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:29,480
neighborhood Crips yeah well that is but

649
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,970
he was supposed to meet with someone the

650
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,070
next day talk about preventing gang

651
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,410
violence yeah yeah so he was in a gang

652
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:40,910
right mmm that's it that's right right

653
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:42,380
yeah but yet he's trying to stop can be

654
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,210
trying to prevent people from going on

655
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,460
the same yeah yeah yeah but I think a

656
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,820
lot of the times to uh originally gangs

657
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,650
were a way for like people who were in

658
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,680
like broken families and stuff and they

659
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:56,540
would have like like brother brotherly

660
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,010
ties or someone a father to look up to

661
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,290
and everything like that it wasn't it

662
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:02,030
wasn't originally supposed to be about

663
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,800
like fighting and all that everything

664
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,540
he's like right you know talking about

665
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:10,190
late in the 40s or the 50s

666
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:12,350
we're like the the original purpose of

667
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,860
the gang yeah I was supposed to be like

668
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,830
that before

669
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,670
yeah and then it kind of just like

670
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:21,650
turned into something else

671
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:23,000
mmm right well I mean that that yeah

672
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,010
like I said I don't know enough about

673
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,720
this like whole conspiracy I literally

674
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,520
just spent an hour before you guys came

675
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,590
over yeah I'm looking up stuff so I

676
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,640
don't want to spread misinformation and

677
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,160
also don't talk more because you might

678
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,880
die what oh yeah this oh that there's

679
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,010
that too and like there's the fear of I

680
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,840
mean like people shedding light on the

681
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,670
fact that yeah even Nick Cannon the fact

682
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,900
that we're talking about technically we

683
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,670
shouldn't be talking about it is what

684
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:51,340
the messes are trying to say yeah in

685
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:54,160
this conspiracy but so if we die

686
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:59,120
[Laughter]

687
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,980
mysteriously yes I'm an idea of how do

688
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,950
you think you're gonna die though right

689
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,450
yeah yeah like maybe you're gonna like

690
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,950
some people think like I'll do I just

691
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,240
know I'm gonna die in a car crash no I

692
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,710
don't I don't have one but some people

693
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,370
would think that they have a feeling no

694
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,309
Walker

695
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:16,970
to a forest put my hands up above my

696
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:18,409
head and dissolve and become a plant all

697
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,990
right that's how I'm gonna do it if

698
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:22,370
you're gonna let me choose you know I'm

699
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,380
not letting you choose I just think how

700
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:27,260
do you think you're gonna die I think

701
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:29,450
that's probably how would we ever never

702
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,510
want to be a plant no I mean I'm gonna

703
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:37,640
like into like the trees Oh like ashes I

704
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:39,799
don't know either

705
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,110
I've never sounds like a psychic how do

706
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:45,770
you think you're going to die is

707
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:49,039
actually in this is in this 36 questions

708
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,870
to love thing that I saw okay and it is

709
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,270
like it has a lot of different questions

710
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,409
that eventually like get you and this

711
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,970
other person you get to know each other

712
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:57,409
a little bit more one of the questions

713
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,179
was how do you think you're gonna do you

714
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:01,309
have an idea how you think you're gonna

715
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:04,490
die do you know I don't I said it how

716
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:07,340
would you want to fast very painless Pam

717
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,350
I would want to die in my sleep I think

718
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,720
that's probably I would assume the most

719
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:14,179
people like and I'll be sure to remember

720
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,890

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,000
a very basic one well it kind of ties

756
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,980
into do we have memories from our

757
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,330
children oh no I don't know do you have

758
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,260
one immediately that you can think of

759
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:58,520
but favorite weird it's a but I don't

760
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,860
know if I said this on the bias but one

761
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:04,340
of my favorite memories is when I got

762
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:08,710
spanked by my dad what because I passed

763
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:11,420
another kid and I passed him and

764
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,010
remember like like I went to a private

765
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,070
school I was like a Christian school and

766
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:19,010
my dad was a was a pastor what true

767
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:20,360
right so it was like oh why why am i

768
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,250
messing up so everything is like it

769
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,460
didn't look well mm-hmm and so my dad

770
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:28,280
spanked me but he used a racket paddle

771
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,410
and not a normal racket paddle a wooden

772
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,600
racket Palace know what racket paddles

773
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:34,730
are wooden know there's the string ones

774
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,900
although old school ones were wooden I

775
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,660
think you know I was like you know it's

776
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,340
about three so why do you like what that

777
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:45,890
you liked it no yes what you got you

778
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:47,960
into it's because oh he said after he

779
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,520
like spanked me so hard the first time

780
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,430
they don't even pull the paddle back

781
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,650
that my whole butt was red except for

782
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:56,330
the little air holes so it is like

783
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:58,970
there's little white spots on my butt

784
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:02,240
from the rag and I just it's a funny

785
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:04,310
image I just think it's funny you saw it

786
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,780
no but the way he said it is very like

787
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,100
you can see it in your own head you know

788
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,450
huh like your whole blood is just red

789
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,160
except it looks like you have a reverse

790
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,290
chickenpox oh I thought you liked that

791
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,790
for a different reason oh no it makes

792
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,490
sense where you're going to Japan pretty

793
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,990
sure if I if after you got spanked I

794
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,050
went up to you and ask you like hey did

795
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,610
you like that you perfect oh that's

796
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,440
definitely not definitely at the time

797
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,940
but now it's kind of funny I've got so

798
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,100
the conclusion that you're a masochist

799
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,140
that's the one that likes pain right I

800
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,760
don't know I think a little bit but not

801
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,410
I think a lot of it because for one

802
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,730
verbally you like to get abused and you

803
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,230
amuse yourself I do

804
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,820
and

805
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,919
and when it comes to comes to like the

806
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,870
shoots that we do like the other day we

807
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:42,549
did the the pulling the sheet thing

808
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,230
right yeah and then you're like out of

809
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,390
nowhere you just like hey what if I were

810
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:48,130
to like ride into this table and fly off

811
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,419
the bike and land like I like dude

812
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,160
that's super dangerous so we're not

813
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:52,480
gonna do that but you really want to do

814
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,950
it so you did I thought it'd be on your

815
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,470
own for your own video yeah and I

816
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,940
thought I thought I think oh and that's

817
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,770
just one of the fairies

818
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,410
I don't you're a masochist the inside of

819
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:06,220
my thigh mm-hmm yeah that's your fetish

820
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:09,280
huh I don't know maybe mmm you have a

821
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:14,290
favorite childhood memory no but I want

822
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:17,140
to figure out more about Paco favorite

823
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,640
childhood memory I don't know if I can I

824
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:23,650
mean it would take me a long time to

825
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:26,770
think of one specific one but probably

826
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:28,059
like sports like I did some baseball

827
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,290
when I was really young I had like some

828
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:30,730
pretty good memories from and martial

829
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,770
arts doing martial arts growing up and

830
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,299
like going to tournaments and getting

831
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:36,190
first place in those and it was just

832
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:40,210
really good memories I think from like

833
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:43,360
you know feeling accomplished as a young

834
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,980
boy I was a very unhappy kid so I didn't

835
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,320
have a lot of good memories yeah at a

836
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,030
very it wasn't a rough childhood it was

837
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,910
just a very I was a very unhappy person

838
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:53,740
naturally you still are no I'm happy all

839
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:58,090
the time for simple things you just

840
00:31:53,740 --> 00:32:00,040
don't smile I guess not what about like

841
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:03,309
extracurricular stuff that made you made

842
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:05,799
you happy like when I hated like most of

843
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:07,660
my time was spent either studying doing

844
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,010
basketball judo which I hated both at

845
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,840
the time I didn't like basketball back

846
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,179
then I never hit like a sweet little

847
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,340
jumper and never I never had many any

848
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:16,330
shots really I was like block I wasn't

849
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,410
the worst guy on the team but I was

850
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:21,150
probably the second or third worse

851
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:24,280
mm-hmm yeah so it wasn't very happy

852
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,270
you'd be like yeah that's not really

853
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,100
want to go to the next one though

854
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,559
because I got some sleeves to pull okay

855
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:35,340
not grab it's questionable thank you

856
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:39,070
Raina next we got Joe Joe dick key Dicky

857
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,210
thoughts and reusable straws oh do you

858
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,950
want to pull the sleeve sir so do you

859
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,530
want me you can go ahead

860
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:47,140
reusable straws I love reusable straws

861
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,610
oh really mr. using the straw right now

862
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,799
that's not reusable

863
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,380
that is reusable honestly yes it again

864
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,330
um the when I use some at home I'll

865
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,490
actually like clean these but I'm

866
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,140
talking like the metal ones yeah I

867
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,000
thought they were talking about like the

868
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,400
ones you recycle like the like the paper

869
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,280
ones you can talk about that those ones

870
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,929
I do not agree I don't I know it's all

871
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,390
about the environment and stuff like

872
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:12,549
straws can't do straws really make that

873
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,020
big of a difference like I know there's

874
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:15,429
a lot of straws in the world yeah

875
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,740
there's got to be other ways because

876
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:20,830
those straws are awful I think with the

877
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:24,070
straws thing supposedly it doesn't have

878
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,600
that huge of an impact but it still has

879
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,210
a little bit of an impact and also the

880
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,070
thing that it gets is the visual aid

881
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,320
because there is this one picture where

882
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,090
this turtle had a huge like just a straw

883
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,110
so yeah yeah I saw that and they're

884
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,549
trying to pull it out and there's like

885
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,720
in his brain and all that stuff and

886
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:41,169
first of all that drug should emit

887
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,910
snorting drugs that drug turtle [ __ ]

888
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:45,840
it's a starting drug and your own joke

889
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:48,070
ruin my joke I'm not funny well I mean

890
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,580
so that seems more like an emotional

891
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,410
reaction

892
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,570
yeah like a logical one because there's

893
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,490
other things you can like before straws

894
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,410
I'm sure mmm I haven't done the research

895
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:59,740
but I'm sure there's other things more

896
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:02,590
you know yeah feasible or whatever it is

897
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,390
to fix then straw straws can be like the

898
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,010
worst thing like why that and yet every

899
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,919
place in LA is starting to do these

900
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,570
paper straws yeah and I hate him like I

901
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:13,000
get paid you get paper in your mouth I

902
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:16,139
think I thought okay thoughts on

903
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,820
reusable straws reusable straws are good

904
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,010
yes yes yeah agree agree I think you

905
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,379
should be using a reusable a lot of

906
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,820
things like I bring I don't use plastic

907
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:26,980
bags anymore like I bring my own bags

908
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,780
how hard is it I reuse plastic bags yeah

909
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,429
how hard is it to just use the same like

910
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,109
just get a bag and bring it same thing

911
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:34,600
with straws how hard is it just to clean

912
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:36,340
a straw and reuse it sort of you save

913
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,240
your plastic bags for the market I don't

914
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,280
even get plastic bags

915
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,710
I bring I breathe you see I do know I

916
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,460
saw I go I think it's a Asian thing yeah

917
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:47,500
I say yeah yeah you guys do that growing

918
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,419
up make senior plastic bags from the

919
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,060
market and stuff because we do remember

920
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:53,859
to layer our trash bag or our trash cans

921
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,590
and stuff like that and just for a

922
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:59,109
random stuff I got scolded for using

923
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,859
straws from someone really recently

924
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:02,380
mm-hmm

925
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:05,320
and it weird thing is a

926
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,000
girl that it was into and so I was like

927
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,500
just being like just trying to catch

928
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,910
conversation as soon as I use a straw

929
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,220
she just got mad at me and I was like

930
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,290
well it's over good job

931
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,360
that's all it takes huh yeah but even

932
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,280
these straws you can clean these I mean

933
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,720
I know it sounds kind of wack but you

934
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,250
can actually wash these and clean it no

935
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,290
it's super easy this is actually a topic

936
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,450
that I was gonna bring up for notes was

937
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,760
recycling and apparently you're gonna

938
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:30,790
bring up recycling yeah because the

939
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,500
thing is a lot of people think that it

940
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,720
could be too late for recycling that you

941
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,670
know we're killing the earth and it's

942
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,020
it's too late for the stuff like that

943
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:42,400
because before China actually we

944
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,560
exported a lot of our recycling and our

945
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,380
waste to China because they're such

946
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,610
their cheap labor laws they were able to

947
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,730
take these things recycle the trillions

948
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:54,540
of products but China I think within the

949
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:59,340
past couple years something banned

950
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:01,900
importing of like loathsome waste so now

951
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:05,820
cities that used to make like I think

952
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:08,830
like sixty something million dollars a a

953
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,050
per ton for recycling mm-hmm

954
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:13,050
now have to pay like to get their

955
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:15,970
recycling done a lot of these places are

956
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:18,940
burning their recycling their waste for

957
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:21,850
energy but it's just like so what does

958
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,100
our I guess country do now in terms of

959
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:25,360
recycling because it takes so much for

960
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,520
them to sort through all these like

961
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,100
small things right so what we could do

962
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,470
individually is to separate them but I

963
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,090
feel like it's because America feels so

964
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,500
entitled a lot of us are just gonna be

965
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,300
like why do I need to do that you know

966
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,100
I'm already helping by recycling why do

967
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,050
I need to take these other steps no

968
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,400
one's going to yeah I mean some people

969
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,930
were obviously but the majority is not

970
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,690
going unless it becomes a cool thing to

971
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:49,800
do or gonna make it cool yeah or it has

972
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:52,510
to become a I mean like high five

973
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,520
yeah well California already has that

974
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,920
though what's worthy yeah you get paid

975
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,690
to recycle you get five cents back I

976
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,160
think California has ten cents right we

977
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,320
had I don't remember what it's not that

978
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,060
you know no we still I mean I still

979
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,160
collect all bottles and stuff like that

980
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,870
but yeah we do get we'd get no rewards

981
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,030
here so I don't see why people are

982
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,560
incentivized here to do it mm-hmm most

983
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,330
people don't I see a lot I drove around

984
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,460
the neighborhood and stuff I don't see

985
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,810
many her cycle like recycling things I

986
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,230
see

987
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:20,640
of trash cans it's more work for people

988
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:23,130
one of the things that ladies in my own

989
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,900
personal opinion is like it's it's it's

990
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,430
good to recycle but it's also like a

991
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,340
good thing to be conscious of like how

992
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:31,320
much trash you're actually using like in

993
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:34,920
general like that's why I think we

994
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:37,020
started trying to like use a lot of

995
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,400
reusable stuff you know and like I know

996
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,840
it sounds kind of hipster but you like

997
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,760
put something like instead of using

998
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,010
things you know bring a jar and like

999
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,420
fill whatever you're getting like rice

1000
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,490
like when we go get rice like we put it

1001
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,890
in like a reasonable bag or a jar so

1002
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,540
we're not very good about the boxes and

1003
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,190
then you use it any throw away the box

1004
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,720
wherever you know what I mean like just

1005
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,850
like a thing in the back of my mind I

1006
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,220
think that yeah that wasn't always like

1007
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:02,100
that it was only like as I became an

1008
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:06,780
adult so yeah but that's my two cents on

1009
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:07,800
it well overall recycling is good more

1010
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,210
people should do it what's unreasonable

1011
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,460
straw is good yeah

1012
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,500
shishi break I'm not a fan of still not

1013
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,140
found a paper straws still not a fan you

1014
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,640
know they used to be made of corn I well

1015
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,220
you told me that yeah why don't they do

1016
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,530
that sounds like it's probably a

1017
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:30,920
conspiracy a conspiracy crosstalk

1018
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:30,920
warning idea she should break already

1019
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:40,620
[Music]

1020
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,940
classy and tried to take it and we're

1021
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:45,900
back in our pack okay and we're back

podcast mug get it at weekend they know

1027
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:10,050

can get it uncle look get it somewhere

1029
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:14,760

yeah CGI right hit the mugs good see we

1033
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,370
already knocked out all the Twitter

1034
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,740
questions now we have them are yeah well

1035
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,640
okay what is this one I won't skip it's

1036
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,579
my favorite

1037
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,710
Tata says out of the videos you guys

1038
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:37,200
created which one of them took the most

1039
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:39,539
time in Hawaii oh that's just a question

1040
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,710
for everyone the most I don't recall

1041
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:47,009
I don't recall a most time time and why

1042
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:49,890
like everything start to finish start

1043
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:51,359
you writing to when it's posted yes I

1044
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,749
don't know you would know that yeah I

1045
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,799
know I think I mean some videos it's

1046
00:39:54,749 --> 00:39:57,930
something I wrote like the year before

1047
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:59,519
does that count sound like I'm actively

1048
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:02,039
working on it though yeah be like from

1049
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,980
when he pulled it up finalized it and

1050
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:06,359
then got it into our hands and then you

1051
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,339
know gets edit it didn't post it

1052
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:10,710
honestly probably one of the BGA videos

1053
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:12,630
those take the longest oh yeah I didn't

1054
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,819
think of that because because your

1055
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,230
prosthetics pardon it that's why it I

1056
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:17,069
mean people will ask for anything I want

1057
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:19,950
you guys make another one it something

1058
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:21,480
like just like 10 minutes it's not ten

1059
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,799
minutes because the videos ten minutes

1060
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,499
does not mean it takes ten minutes to

1061
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:27,420
six ten months so those are what I don't

1062
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:29,910
know about that but I'll usually write a

1063
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,890
concept first I need to have a good idea

1064
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,480
for a song and I don't have to think can

1065
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,509
this song fit into where the storyline

1066
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,160
is where all the guys you know but it's

1067
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:40,410
but then there's another step which is

1068
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,359
even harder which is from there if I

1069
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:44,519
have a concept I work with David to be

1070
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:46,289
like hey can you translate this to

1071
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:49,289
Korean because you need to have Korean

1072
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:51,660
in it right yeah okay pop so there's

1073
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:52,859
that step which is painful because we

1074
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,059
have to find words that I can't even

1075
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,079
contribute I don't know how to make

1076
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:57,690
something sound good

1077
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:01,380
syllable wise I'm wise cuz I don't know

1078
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:03,180
you know green yeah so there's that step

1079
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,579
and then after that we have to make the

1080
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,019
song and I have to learn and the other

1081
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:08,849
guys if they're in it have to learn how

1082
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:11,339
to say these words and not even words

1083
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:12,930
we're saying sounds basically imitating

1084
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:14,940
what we're being told it's really hard

1085
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,589
yeah it's it's just like a and just make

1086
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,019
a song the subtitles take over at that

1087
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:20,730
point that's to make this song and then

1088
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,960
we had to go through all the other stuff

1089
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,549
to make the video it's ridiculous and

1090
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,759
the music video is more of like a

1091
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:28,499
traditional sense of filming a video

1092
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:30,660
like oh there's a budget involved it's a

1093
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:32,940
budget there's a crew like out here we

1094
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,069
do it very like YouTube style right we

1095
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,930
have like quick quick fast out there

1096
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:39,779
it's like setup to the scene you have a

1097
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:41,999
call sign shot that the proper film yeah

1098
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:43,440
yeah and it's it takes way longer it's

1099
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,630
way more expensive

1100
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,569
and so you know what if you guys want a

1101
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:50,609
BGA video patreon right here I'm

1102
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:52,859
thirteen million dollars if you don't

1103
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:54,960
raise thirteen million dollars by 24

1104
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:56,790
hours of when this podcast released just

1105
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,349
can't have it honestly though like

1106
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:00,060
that's part of the reason why I don't do

1107
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,310
it it's like financially not like those

1108
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,319
videos do well but I don't really like

1109
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,640
really benefit from it that much in

1110
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,440
terms of like financial I like to lose

1111
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,460
money I think I'm the first one you know

1112
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,230
it's you don't because they're not

1113
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,180
sponsored if they were sponsored then

1114
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,339
you could get you know it would be worth

1115
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,470
doing but timewise and like money-wise

1116
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:18,750
it's expensive yeah out of my pocket -

1117
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,640
I'm not like yeah and the guys are not

1118
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,470
I'm not paying them they're just doing

1119
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,990
me a favor yeah I being in it dude

1120
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:26,640
you're paying them an exposure sure but

1121
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,810
I don't really count that I would love

1122
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,339
to pay them I just don't have the budget

1123
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:32,069
yeah it all goes towards making the

1124
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:33,180
music video yep one of those those are

1125
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:35,280
the ones that take the longest and

1126
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,619
that's why I don't know but with you

1127
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,730
guys I don't know I mean what what's it

1128
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,780
your turn

1129
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:44,369
what do I say I don't know I mean I mean

1130
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,079
that's that's the one but for you

1131
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:47,609
personally like your experience what is

1132
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,730
the longest one for you I guess the one

1133
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:52,140
that I made out of the videos I created

1134
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,180
like which one took the longest for you

1135
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,980
to like partake in is actually probably

1136
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,770
might've been this the ghost-hunting one

1137
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,410
cuz you were the only editor really no

1138
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:04,530
I'd switched over to Greg oh a large

1139
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:05,819
chunk of it yeah I mean that took a long

1140
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,530
time but that wouldn't be one that I

1141
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:09,450
look back you're like wow that was just

1142
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:16,079
took us such a long time I mean we had

1143
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:18,180
like a an unfortunate loss of progress

1144
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,030
during the process but that that's I

1145
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,710
don't really I mean yeah I don't know I

1146
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,210
can't really think I mean that has to be

1147
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:26,790
pretty much the one that is answered

1148
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:28,770
because mine is my experience is

1149
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:30,450
different in terms of like I can't think

1150
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:32,490
of like a first channel one I can't I

1151
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:33,990
guess I mean I guess the obvious one

1152
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:36,270
will be Dragonball I mean that was a

1153
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,160
long time ago it took a long time or any

1154
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:40,800
of those big effects for yes you know

1155
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,520
those want to take a long time cuz I

1156
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,720
mean yeah people don't know we don't

1157
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,730
know how long it takes

1158
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,500
yeah it's okay it doesn't matter all we

1159
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,970
do is make podcast now anyway I think

1160
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,589
one comment that annoys me the most is

1161
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:54,780
like just Ryan can't you make more

1162
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:57,390
videos I could I definitely could I

1163
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,910

1164
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:03,930
I bet you I could I would shoot I'll

yeah that's easy but we'll watch it but

1169
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:16,350

to him for as well it's well I mean some

00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:39,510
YouTube system I think it's in terms of

1207
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,400
like the uploading system at least it

1208
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:43,350

1220
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,620
thing it's just like roasting well how

1222
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,840
see

1223
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,240
means you think think of it as an insult

1224
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,800
then well no cuz every time you you find

1225
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:22,350
one way to because it's so interesting

1226
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:24,090
you're an interesting person cific she

1227
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:30,510

or you'll be like what well you so you

1229
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:35,160
Paco I don't know if this is a common

1230
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:37,530
thing but you said that you really like

1231
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,960
girls with skinny arms yeah

1232
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:42,480
specifically arms I like the stomach not

1233
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,950
like the legs or skinny arms you said

1234
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:54,300
like haven't heard that finish you said

1235
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:56,850
breakable I've been with the girls who

1236
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,890
weren't break but I mean that that just

1237
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:00,990
gives you a picture in your arm yeah

1238
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,290
that looks very brief in your head now

1239
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,290
your arm

1240
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:09,900
I just find it so interesting it's just

1241
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,760
very interesting to it is I've never

1242
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,890
I've never heard of that like that's

1243
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,450
your interest what that is so specific

1244
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:17,220
that's why cuz I say a lot of things

1245
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:21,570
that other guys would say but then that

1246
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:23,520
we different like nobody can it can also

1247
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,290
display like you can imagine a whole

1248
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,020
person just based off of that one thing

1249
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:29,220
off their arm yeah I accept this

1250
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,750
challenge we got to find those pictures

1251
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,100
and we're gonna test him okay you know

1252
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,960

1253
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,510
like well what are you trying to picture

1254
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,310
oh you like those really tiny girls not

1255
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:39,930
necessarily tiny I actually wanted to

1256
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:43,440
date somebody who's taller than me for a

1257
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:46,860
long time I know are a lot of I still

1258
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,300
would but I personally would prefer and

1259
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,190
I know I'm not tall but I don't really

1260
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,900
like when the girls taller no most guys

1261
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,640
are like that most guys don't want to do

1262
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,260
it like a whole like oh you want to feel

1263
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,640
effeminate like is it it must be

1264
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:00,900
something to have something to do you

1265
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,160
don't mind Oman is shorter than you only

1266
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,690

1321
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,220
that was just me and Ryan and that was

1322
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,980
yeah that was really fun for me

1323
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:15,099
Japan was by far our favorite trip for

1324
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:17,490
sure he got super hooked up yeah shout

1325
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:19,720
out to Ben Grubbs was working at YouTube

1326
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:23,859
so there is this thing called geek week

1327
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:25,270
right and essentially I do I just didn't

1328
00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:26,559
want to go because I was like I need to

1329
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,779
make videos and like what if we what if

1330
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,310
we give you a budget fly all your all

1331
00:50:28,779 --> 00:50:32,560
your team

1332
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:34,960
you know essentially we'll make you a

1333
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,550
video so you not to worry about that but

1334
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,230
you basically had a one week vacation in

1335
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:40,090
Japan yeah and then you promote it on

1336
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,410
geek week and promote on geek week so it

1337
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,820
was like a win-win you know you get a

1338
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:44,740
vacation and you get a video usually

1339
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,890
what stops me from going places I need

1340
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:51,370
to work on something yeah so we did that

1341
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:53,860

1342
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:56,350
money they put us in the Ritz like the

1343
00:50:53,860 --> 00:51:01,180
nice one of the nicest hotels in Tokyo

1344
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:03,040
Ritz Carlton in in Tokyo in Roppongi

1345
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:04,990
it's like the business district very

1346
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,060
fancy super nice I think that's a gaijin

1347
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:08,770
hunter and there was um what does that

1348
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,240
mean it's like we're the Japanese girls

1349
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:12,790
look for a white guy foreigners type of

1350
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,800
thing I didn't know it looked like super

1351
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:17,940
like it looked like businessmen area

1352
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,230
yeah yeah super nice and definitely

1353
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:24,340
expensive not that we'd had to pay for

1354
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:27,040
it yeah but they gave me will Sean and

1355
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:29,770
Greg just four of us yes we all had our

1356
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,500
own suite about the size of like so

1357
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:34,660
pointless suite had two beds yeah

1358
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,430
it was so pointless but it was like the

1359
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:38,560
best like it's hard to beat when you're

1360
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:40,180

it let someone sleep in ours or

1365
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,010

00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:51,820
too big there's too much room and and it

1367
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:52,930

1383
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:30,520
love Japan yeah cuz we had such a but

1384
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:32,260
it's such a um such an interesting place

1385
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,910
it's the only time I went on a trip

1386
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,680
somewhere where I felt like this is

1387
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,940
actually like a completely different

1388
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,370
country because no one understands you

1389
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,430
yeah like in Singapore people still

1390
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:42,950
speak English

1391
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:45,710
Hong Kong actually no I take that back

1392
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:47,809
we went that mean changing that wasn't a

1393
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:49,279
good experience I had a horrible thing

1394
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:50,119
that felt the same more like no one

1395
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,529
really yeah

1396
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:53,390
taxi drivers trying to scam me and

1397
00:52:51,529 --> 00:52:55,130
Derrick the whole time they're trying to

1398
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:57,049
overcharge us like double and we

1399
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,640
couldn't get anywhere and the people who

1400
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:01,430
brought us out kind of weird like

1401
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,770

couldn't find a hotel like it was fun so

1404
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:12,859
in Japan I would say go to an onsen

1405
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,779
preferably one that you actually have to

1406
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:16,520

they do some weird stuff mm-hmm but it's

1428
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,760
at the same time they're like the nicest

1429
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:13,099
people like go never meet any more

1430
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,710
polite have better service and in Japan

1431
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:17,270
to me I don't know just my opinion but

1432
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,920
they do some weird stuff like his

1433
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,329
process Club that we went to remember

1434
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,390
there was this place called Black Rose

1435
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:24,859
yep and it's a S&M bar you know what

1436
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:27,049
that is yeah yeah like would be nice

1437
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:29,960
they do that and they do like whatnot

1438
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:31,099
that we did it was closed so I don't

1439
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,069
know if you did you ever tell this story

1440
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:35,390
I don't know but we were with like the

1441
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:36,740
person who was taking us around I like

1442
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:38,779
you were just trying to show us like

1443
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:41,240
weird stuff weird stuff fun time and we

1444
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:43,339
went up to this bar and just you and him

1445
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,839
just me and him and we was elevator the

1446
00:54:43,339 --> 00:54:47,900
elevator opens up and you step right

1447
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:50,869
into the bar and it was red velvet all

1448
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:52,910
over the walls and can't melted candles

1449
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:53,580
everywhere I was like black furniture

1450
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:55,260
and we

1451
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:57,720
walking was completely empty and I was

1452
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,640
like do you think we should go in here

1453
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,860
like what's gonna happen we walked to

1454
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,350
the end of the bar he just like like

1455
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,570
walks in dude to do like American guy

1456
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:09,150
hey everybody here and I was just like

1457
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:11,010
um I think they're close and he's like

1458
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:13,170
yeah I guess their clothes and they just

1459
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:15,090
laugh but I came down I was like kind of

1460
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,360
scared like that terrifying it creeped

1461
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,490
me out

1462
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,140
yeah but I'm pretty sure if that bar

1463
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:22,410
would have been open we would have had a

1464
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:24,690
different experience oh for sure that's

1465
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:26,490
what I mean though I think that's the

1466
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,690
kind of stuff that you would do yeah I

1467
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,950
probably do some ways though like that

1468
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,660
yeah yeah I think there's a good amount

1469
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,070
of them they're pretty excited for you

1470
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:36,300
mr. Ainge better bring back some good

1471
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:38,340
stories for this podcast and then film

1472
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,710
it yeah I actually wanna try and do like

1473
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:43,500
uh I was really inspired cuz I just saw

1474
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:45,390
the Conan yeah it out Without Borders

1475
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,550
something that dude he's hilarious man

1476
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:49,200
so funny like I'm inspired I want to do

1477
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,390
something like this right things don't

1478
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,060
you feel like only he can get over sure

1479
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:56,340
he says some things and he like the way

1480
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:58,590
he's so charismatic that he's able to

1481
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,730
act a certain way when people will laugh

1482
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:02,280
yeah you did it

1483
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:03,930
you'd be like your comments would just

1484
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,420
be the opposite you know I mean maybe

1485
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:08,670
well that's why you being a comedian is

1486
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:10,170
about being self-aware you know and just

1487
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:13,200
like understanding how people perceive

1488
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:15,510
you yeah so I I mean like it shouldn't

1489
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,460
change but he what's being said is still

1490
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:19,830
the same thing like he says some things

1491
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,690
and he does some things that I feel like

1492
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:24,030
if Logan Paul did it oh for sure exactly

1493
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:25,440
the same as sure he would receive the

1494
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:27,810
exact opposite response

1495
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,580
hmm but it's just based on likability

1496
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:32,160
how are we going in on this part about

1497
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:33,330
what is it is time what I mean just

1498
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,070
extending that conversation because

1499
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:37,860
that's a conversation in itself is it

1500
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:40,590
how like people's actions yeah aren't

1501
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:43,170
the same just because of who they are

1502
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:46,080
yeah of course you know I mean it's not

1503
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:47,760
necessarily fair but I think it is is it

1504
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:52,410
fair I do think it is so you think it's

1505
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:55,170
fair like Jesse Smollett is famous so

1506
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:58,140
he's able to get out of a crime that he

1507
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:59,730
committed no I don't really no no no

1508
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:02,100
there's no way I thought of it because

1509
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:03,450
that's I just saw a video today yeah

1510
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,580
that he's not getting talked about that

1511
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:07,260
what a Chicago Police Department was

1512
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,859
basically saying like it's the reason

1513
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,269
why

1514
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:10,739
he's getting away with this it shows

1515
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:12,150
that yeah if you're famous we have money

1516
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:14,279
you can get away with things yeah and

1517
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:15,480
that's what I mean in like not people

1518
00:57:14,279 --> 00:57:17,190
aren't treated the same you see who they

1519
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,150
are and I I mean I don't think that's

1520
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,410
fair yeah

1521
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:21,359
well what I'm talking about is like the

1522
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:23,489
whole likability thing if you've built a

1523
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:27,390
foundation and a character behind you

1524
00:57:23,489 --> 00:57:29,519
sure that shows that you know I you have

1525
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,960
a positive attitude and you're trying to

1526
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:32,999
do things for the better that you know

1527
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,410
certain things that you do he would

1528
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:36,660
should have an understanding of okay

1529
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:39,839
there's a reason behind this it's not

1530
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:42,180
purely for what he's just saying I think

1531
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,730
it's very important to yeah build a

1532
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:47,099
foundation and context just like the

1533
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:49,980
