1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,360
I don't know about you guys but I have

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,950
the most awkward situations when I first

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,720
shake someone's hand maybe it's just me

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,280
maybe I'm just off now I couldn't be I'm

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,599
sure everyone has experienced an awkward

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,410
handshake before especially to all you

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,880
guys you know what I'm talking about

8
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,230
right every single group of friends has

9
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,849
different handshakes that they and I can

10
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,619
never remember which of my friends do

11
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,699
which type of henshin I've had a lot of

12
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,020
awkward handshakes in my life but

13
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,000
recently I just had one of the most

14
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,160
awkward handshakes I've ever experienced

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,420
before and it basically inspired me to

16
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,330
make this video there's really no way to

17
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,130
reenact how bad or awkward this was but

18
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,170
it kind of went like this so there I was

19
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,850
about to enter a house party with my

20
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,350
friend Derek but we'll call him Darrin

21
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,700
to protect his identity I'm not gonna

22
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,809
lie I was a little nervous because I

23
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,100
don't go to many parties where I don't

24
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,930
know anyone and these people were all

25
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,040
Derek's for dead Darren's friends we

26
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,270
entered the house and just like any

27
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,770
other party there was a lot of people

28
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,300
there instantly my heart started beating

29
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,800
faster and faster knowing what was

30
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,300
coming next that's when the guy throwing

31
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,950
the party came over to greet Devin and

32
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,030
myself I watched as he went over to

33
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,770
Dennis and gave him the classic

34
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,489
handshake to hug flawlessly and that's

35
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,690
when it happened

36
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,680
don't have been pointed to me and said

37
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,340
the worst that would lead to my

38
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,109
inevitable day and as he turned to me I

39
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,609
had to make a decision what handshake

40
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,870
should I give him I know for a fact that

41
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,220
he does the handshake to hug me because

42
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,450
I just saw him do it to Dexter but he

43
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,439
also lives in a relative in this house

44
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,310
which means he's probably some kind of

45
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,570
businessman that there's a lot of

46
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,040
business handshakes but this was a

47
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,659
business this was a house party with his

48
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,580
buddies so maybe he just wants to pound

49
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:30,400
it yeah that's what he wants

50
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:32,260
hey what's up mask yeah that's when I

51
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,940
realized I had to get out of here with

52
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,230
or without Darrin either that or what I

53
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,960
have to kill every single person that

54
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:40,720
wins the Darrin and that's when I

55
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,340
realized I was narrating all out okay so

56
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,740
maybe I exaggerated that just a tad

57
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,720
that's that that's not what happened but

58
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,950
the situation was pretty awkward and I

59
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,510
probably won't be hanging out with those

60
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,130
guys anymore I'm tired of always having

61
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,480
awkward handshakes with people there are

62
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,740
so many different handshakes in the

63
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,850
world and I believe the more handshakes

64
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,080
you know the more prepared you'll be

65
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,390
when it happens and after countless

66
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,190
hours of research and lab tests and

67
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,720
googling I created the ultimate

68
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,550
handshake that will help you in any

69
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,780
situation no matter how awkward but

70
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,950
