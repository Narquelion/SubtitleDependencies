87
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,850

entertainer yep yeah I think he was with

91
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,550
her I mean I don't know I could be wrong

92
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,410
I could be just like saying the wrong

93
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,720
thing but how come you guys didn't go

94
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,150

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,250
from here isn't it I said alarm for it

96
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,500
and it went off and I slept in on

97
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,640
accident so basically for those that

98
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,200
don't know nothing happened

99
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,239
really right yeah what he actually

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,060
stormed it right that's what I heard and

101
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,680
then I also heard that there was a

102
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,630
concert called alien fest that took

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
place there as well uh-huh I don't know

104
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,660
anyone that went and people that were

105
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,430
asking me or like yeah you live a year

106
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,989
ago and I thought they were joking and I

107
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,799
was like laughing and they're like no

108
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,780
are you gonna go it's like oh there's

109
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,310
million there was so many there was

110
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,600
millions of people signed up for it and

111
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,459
I think like I don't know what the

112
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,320
numbers are maybe look up how much

113
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,609
people actually went but it wasn't I saw

114
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,900
a picture and there wasn't that many

115
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:25,340
people well the cards good it was a

116
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,260
decent turnout but I mean nobody's

117
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,700
stormed it obviously it's a joke but I

118
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,610
thought there would be at least one or

119
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,400
two dummies that just rush maybe I'm

120
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:38,500
sure maybe there was mmm I hope not yeah

121
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:42,080
it says here that there are only

122
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,990
hundreds of people The Guardian says

123
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,210
that 75 people were at the gate whoa

124
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,300
that's it no there was more than that

125
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,800
right I don't know the Guardian picture

126
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,330
of something else then according to the

127
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,370
Guardian the gate is located on the

128
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,400
washboard dirt roads and is a rugged

129
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,729
journey but about 150 people managed to

130
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,680
get within selfie distance whoa one

131
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:06,080
person was arrested at the raid

132
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,380
also someone did do it and that charge

133
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,660
was for public urination so nobody

134
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,979
actually went in right right

135
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,960
damn do you guys believe in aliens

136
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:19,759
aliens I think that's different I mean

137
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,590
if you believe it that they exist do you

138
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,169
believe they exist well I think so I

139
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,060
think it's kind of almost silly to not

140
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:31,690
think they exist have you ever seen one

141
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:33,500
no I've never had any kind of experience

142
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,520
which is kind of interesting to think

143
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,870
about because if I've never had a

144
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,210
personal experience usually that's what

145
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,449
I judge like my opinions on things for

146
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,280
but for aliens I think in terms of how

147
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:46,430
many numbers of universes there are

148
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,289
right it's kind of it would be nearly

149
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,930
impossible for me how do you define an

150
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:52,789
alien though like extra I think there's

151
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,340
some there's other things that we don't

152
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:58,789
know about if they count as aliens then

153
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,530
yeah like the ones that you see you know

154
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:03,229
like the the ones with the big eyes and

155
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,000
the pointy 'f Chan or whatever they

156
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:09,349
called the greys yeah the stereotypical

157
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,710
alien do you believe that those types of

158
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:14,720
beings may have existed or do exist so

159
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,400
any form of intelligent life that looks

160
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,930
kind of like what we yeah mainstream

161
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,909
media from outside of the earth yeah I

162
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,699
think it's very possible I mean I think

163
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:23,750
a lot of people claim things from what

164
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,520
they've seen well obviously we have

165
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,210
learned a lot from movies and stuff like

166
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,220
that mm-hmm

167
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,750
and again that could be coming from just

168
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,520
someone's imagination or it could be

169
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,659
coming from real accounts because it has

170
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,340
been real cosmic who knows if they're

171
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:38,570
telling the truth or not mm-hmm but I

172
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:41,240
think that if it's very possible that

173
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,699
these aliens are just humans that

174
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,280
evolved to that point mmm and they're

175
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:47,900
actually like like I said I mean it I

176
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,750
like from the future right they're the

177
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,340
future versions of us essentially I mean

178
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,289
this is this just one theory there's so

179
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,760
many yeah I don't know enough we should

180
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,530
have like a segment if we start talking

181
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:09,349
about this stuff we all pull out tinfoil

182
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:11,840
hats the chocolate kiss on his head but

183
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,400
yet I think it's possible that's also

184
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,229
think it's possible that we are living

185
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,510
in a simulation I mean you've heard that

186
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:18,560
I've heard this before

187
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,850
because there's no weight I mean the

188
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,860
thing is there's with that theory

189
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,960
there's no way you can say yes or no

190
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,270
that it's true or not there's no way you

191
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,090
can tell that we know yeah and even if

192
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,590
you did know well who cares what can you

193
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,150
do about it right you know there's

194
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,340
nothing if we are in a simulation right

195
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,870
now there's doesn't it doesn't matter

196
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,490
like it's nothing we can do about it

197
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,050
right yeah so what's like the

198
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,670
correlation between I mean there is a

199
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,150
correlation in some theories between

200
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,820
aliens and simulation theory right for

201
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,710
the universe something some aliens and

202
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,200
simulation well I was thinking that I

203
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,880
mean this is I don't even know if I've

204
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,160
heard this theory I just thought mm-hmm

205
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,930
about it that aliens essentially they're

206
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,300
higher levels of and I'm just seeing

207
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,680
aliens and abroad you know intelligent

208
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,890
being yeah there's some there's a

209
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,940
there's a level that we don't understand

210
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:10,430
a level of intelligence essentially that

211
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,750
if they were at that level we wouldn't

212
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,950
be able to comprehend it anyway and

213
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,840
that's like us being us like they

214
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,930
created it's a simulation and then we're

215
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,850
in it right it's like like if we were to

216
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,360
turn on the Sims and create a world for

217
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,800
the Sims

218
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,900
right and they're living in that little

219
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,580
world they would never know we existed

220
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,400
controlling them right or it's like you

221
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,810
can't explain to an ant what a

222
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,840
automobile is right right you can't

223
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:35,800
explain math recently I don't know where

224
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,660
I saw this but someone was talking about

225
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,040
describing different dimensions or yeah

226
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,930
third dimension of fourth to me I don't

227
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,090
know what it's called but it's an ant

228
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,800
like if it an ant or on a table and

229
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,870
there was like an object on the table

230
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,000
and you were to take it away it would

231
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,680
have just disappeared to the end but

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,850
really we just moved it under the table

233
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,420
or something like that I don't know what

234
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,970
I'm talking about

235
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,650
I'm just butchering that but yeah I

236
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,840
think I think it's possible but I think

237
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,390
what I mean I'm gonna try to come at it

238
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,990
from a different angle but I think an

239
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:08,930
ant in animals are very different to

240
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,830
come I find it tough to compare animals

241
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:14,840
to human beings because you know animals

242
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,990
are instinctual like they they act on

243
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,190
instincts right you you throw a bone and

244
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,560
they're gonna run after it right but

245
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,470
humans we have a soul I believe we have

246
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,350
a soul and and I think that we have a

247
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,690
choice we have freewill to make a

248
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,400
decision like I can decide to slap you

249
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,350
and I don't think that

250
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,640
there's a I don't think we're I mean I

251
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,990
can I can entertain the thought of

252
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,589
having a living in a parallel universe

253
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:42,710
but because we have this free will in a

254
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,660
choice to make and in emotions right

255
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,670
which can drive us in and move us in

256
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,020
different ways and we can also create

257
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,420
that's what makes us different than

258
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,300
animals is we actually can create pieces

259
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,610
of art and different things I think

260
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,130
we're much more intelligent beings

261
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:01,040
much more you know we have more more

262
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,470
depth and like you know I have a choice

263
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,180
to like slap you right right now I could

264
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,570
throw something at you or whatever I

265
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,160
want to do but to say we're in a

266
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,200
parallel universe in and it's like The

267
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,440
Sims where you know we would control

268
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,690
this character but I don't think there's

269
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,020
something controlling the way that you

270
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,970
know like my decisions that I make how

271
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,470
do you know how do you know everything

272
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,240
you just thought right now wasn't

273
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,089
controlled by some higher intelligence

274
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,820
that's programming you or programmed you

275
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:33,980
to essentially think this in this way I

276
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,900
think that I would like to see Ides of

277
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,580
yeah what people believe yeah I mean

278
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,529
yeah for sure you can choose some people

279
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,420
believe you know I mean just to be to

280
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:45,320
clarify you're Christian I'm a Christian

281
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:49,010
and I I believe we were created by a

282
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,080
create tour that you know in in in the

283
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,700
creator's image so the Christians

284
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,589
believe that God is the creator of the

285
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,420
universe you know it's just the

286
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:58,520
beginning the beginning of time yep

287
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,200
right I mean there are Christians that

288
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,270
do believe in the Big Bang right that

289
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,850
was the beginning of what happened I

290
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,910
mean Christians you'd be stupid to not

291
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,050
believe in science right science is not

292
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,390
the complete opposite of religion

293
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,310
science is in a way its own religion

294
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,600
it's a yeah it's definitely theories

295
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:18,260
there's theories and there's facts

296
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,180
within science but I think that you know

297
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,940
I believe we were created because the

298
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,560
question that and you know III if I'm

299
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,560
being honest I do struggle with it

300
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,870
sometimes in regards to were we really

301
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,140
created right and but I have to go back

302
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,610
in time and nobody was ever there right

303
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,890
you could have been a million years ago

304
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,360
it could have been this is anybody argue

305
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,650
about we're not argue about we talk

306
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,300
about I'll talk about a lot because

307
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,610
we're into this kind of stuff but you

308
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,059
know if you look at the Big Bang it's

309
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,639
basically to dust

310
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:49,469
particles coming at each other and then

311
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,169
hitting each other and then turning into

312
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:55,139
something but for two particles to move

313
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:57,779
there needs to be a force right so if

314
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:00,479
there's a force like whose builds that

315
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:02,129
momentum or that gives that push for

316
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:03,659
that particle to even be there in the

317
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:05,999
first week where that particle come from

318
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:08,579
is it energy like was the universe

319
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:10,979
always there like why why is there

320
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,439
energy moving you know there needs to be

321
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:17,069
something that pushes that so it's tough

322
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,079
for me to believe that it so I always

323
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,239
have to question what came before that

324
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,559
so you're saying you believe that

325
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:24,029
there's something behind the curtain

326
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,339
even at the very beginning of where

327
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:28,409
science starts yeah yeah it's like if

328
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,569
though if you're saying if the particles

329
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:31,829
that collided is that's the Big Bang

330
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:33,809
Theory right yeah and that's what

331
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:36,359
created the universe universe universe

332
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:37,739
yeah what area was it in before that for

333
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:40,049
one and then who created the particles

334
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:42,029
we create the force right and what I'm

335
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:44,999
saying is and like you said there's no

336
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:47,039
way to really know for a fact yeah and I

337
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:48,539
think with scientists who there's the

338
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,769
whole point of science is doubt right

339
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,459
like they always doubt and they're

340
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,249
trying to learn more by doing

341
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:55,499
experiments and after X many times they

342
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:57,569
come up with a theory right of doing the

343
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:59,759
same thing over and over but they're

344
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:03,359
still always doubt so there's no exact

345
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:05,969
nobody has the exact 100% answer that's

346
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,049
always say there's no 100% right um but

347
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:11,519
you're saying from your perspective that

348
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:13,289
well I mean you struggle with it because

349
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,939
you're very logical yeah but what do you

350
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:17,669
what are your thoughts on that then my

351
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:19,319
thought is that my lot like if I'm being

352
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:21,059
extremely logical or you're a very

353
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:23,399
Christian person we can talk about that

354
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,589
tightly I think my because I'm also very

355
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:34,109
logical to and try to be as realistic as

356
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:35,609
possible I do think that I think that it

357
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:37,889
makes logical sense for me that there

358
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:40,049
was something whether it be a God of the

359
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,809
Bible or God of whatever it was or some

360
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:44,099
sort of energy or you know whatever it

361
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:45,449
was I mean we could say that some people

362
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:47,609
could say that there were aliens before

363
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:49,919
us right that created Earth but at the

364
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:52,079
same time it's like okay then where the

365
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,729
aliens come from was did they have their

366
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,169
own form of a Big Bang yeah but what I

367
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:57,449
mean what I mean is like I mean

368
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:58,840
essentially we're the whole simulation

369
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:01,240
thing we're talking about is

370
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,400
almost the same theory it's just we're

371
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,710
renaming it in a we're like masking it

372
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,990
because really the aliens are God in

373
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,940
this scenario in the simulation you

374
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,860
created the simulation right right God

375
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,390
created the particles or whatever you're

376
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,100
trying to say right the Big Bang or

377
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,750
whatever I don't I don't know the I

378
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,570
don't know the Bible well well enough to

379
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:22,420
compare it yeah but essentially is it in

380
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,220
your head possible that God is just an

381
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,690
alien or someone in the future or some

382
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,339
higher level of intelligence I think

383
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,380
it's um rated this you know yes actually

384
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:31,990
I think it's something worth discussing

385
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:35,380
and like talking about yeah but isn't it

386
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:37,839
in your in Christianity yeah almost like

387
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,290
sinful to be thinking in that way no no

388
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,279
God God didn't give us a brain to think

389
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:49,540
like in a box you know he I think when

390
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:53,140
God was the creator like there are a set

391
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:55,029
of rules to live by that help govern

392
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,900
human beings because govern because

393
00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:00,580
human beings by nature are sinful

394
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,290
creatures right like if we act on

395
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,839
instinct if I if I really acted on

396
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,760
instinct I would if someone cut me off

397
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,160
on the street I'd want to punch them

398
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,850
right but but we have these rules and

399
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,040
regulations to govern us as human beings

400
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,500
so that we can choose to make a good

401
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,690
decision choose to be a good person we

402
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,820
can choose to do these things but it's

403
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,980
ultimately the choice that we have so

404
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,750
with that being said we're allowed to

405
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,080
think about these other things there are

406
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,880
a lot of philosophers you know even you

407
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,620
know Einstein questioned this a lot too

408
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,089
right so I think it's it's very powerful

409
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,540
this this whole concept of free will

410
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:42,700
that we can think whatever we want to

411
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:47,980
think we can behave however we want to

412
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:49,630
behave we can you know dream whatever we

413
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,070
want to dream we could debate whatever

414
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,920
we want to debate and I think that's

415
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:56,380
healthy to either reaffirm your faith or

416
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,060
if you don't if you don't believe if you

417
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,270
don't agree with some of the things then

418
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:03,610
you know you can you can you can make

419
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:07,450
that decision I think that's the freedom

420
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,150
that is given within this this religion

421
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,470
if it's if it is I mean I'm just at this

422
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,490
point kind of talked about some of this

423
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,600
stuff but

424
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:19,529
just for the sake of argument sure if if

425
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,940
based essentially if God created

426
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:24,339
everyone right and he knows everything

427
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,770
about that person what they're gonna do

428
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,690
in their future is that really free will

429
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,420
though if God you know how everybody

430
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,130
says oh gods this is God's path or well

431
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,580
I don't know what they say some sayings

432
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,709
like that

433
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,720
if God's created you yeah God's will

434
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:39,190
whether you made mistakes in your past

435
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,020
and you corrected them like you're on

436
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,330
this certain path that God created for

437
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,209
you right God created that path is that

438
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,070
really free will because he's like in a

439
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,600
simulation if you compute and you put

440
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,370
these certain you put in a code for this

441
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,899
character this character is gonna think

442
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,110
like this he's gonna believe in free

443
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:54,970
will

444
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,959
he's gonna believe I'm gonna make these

445
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,930
mistakes I'm gonna learn from these

446
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:01,660
mistakes I'm gonna believe that God that

447
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:03,190
God created this is that still

448
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,760
considered free well I don't know if

449
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,709
that made sense

450
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,540
well actually I know you're asking and

451
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:11,290
and I think it's a question that a lot

452
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,569
of you know people of many faiths think

453
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,069
about and you know they could struggle

454
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,809
with it or they'll have their own answer

455
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,589
or feel peace what do you think so what

456
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:22,600
I think is for me you know this is this

457
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,059
is definitely something that I've I've

458
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,670
thought about and I am still on a

459
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:30,820
journey right - it's as of learning in

460
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:34,690
and all that but I think the way that I

461
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:39,120
see it is if we understood everything

462
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:45,340
every sort of abstract abstract concept

463
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:48,309
then we wouldn't be God I mean if we

464
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,880
sorry would be God it would be we would

465
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:54,490
be God if we understood every single

466
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,920
abstract concept right but because God

467
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,260
let's let's just say if God did exist

468
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,270
mm-hmm

469
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,010
God would not be a great it wouldn't he

470
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,740
wouldn't be a god if he thought on our

471
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:09,460
level right if he thought in the way

472
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,570
that we thought then yeah it does it

473
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,250
just doesn't make sense right he

474
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,160
wouldn't be a God God needs to be an

475
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,290
all-powerful all-knowing all-loving and

476
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,600
cut so I mean like with that admitting

477
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,790
that the admitting that we don't think

478
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,470
on that level yeah how do we know that

479
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,330
we got it right how do we know that so

480
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,200
essentially if we're nothing on that

481
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,119
level we don't

482
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,739
we're just thinking in terms of what

483
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:32,009
humans know and what we've learned over

484
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:34,570
time from a book yep right and

485
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:37,119
essentially like we don't know for sure

486
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,279
we don't but but what do we know that

487
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,809
we're that how do Christians know right

488
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,299
so that's something called faith so I

489
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:45,039
think faith applies not only in

490
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:48,580
Christianity but I think faith can apply

491
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,960
in your lives just your daily lives

492
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,960
whether you're a Christian or not right

493
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,509
you have faith that when you drive from

494
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,190
home to the grocery store that that car

495
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,320
coming against you on the other side

496
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,389
with just the line dividing you isn't

497
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,009
gonna turn in crash into you and kill

498
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:04,720
you sure right you have faith that

499
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:08,169
you're gonna get to that destination and

500
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,879
I think in the same way you know

501
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,519
Christians have to operate in that way

502
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:15,639
right I think like I said God gives you

503
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:19,059
a choice you can follow you know and

504
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:20,710
learn more about me right mean like God

505
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,989
God wants you to learn about him so

506
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,480
that's why he gave us you know the word

507
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:26,590
so you can read through it sorry I don't

508
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,210
mean to sound like I'm preaching though

509
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,830
no I mean I think it's I think that's

510
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,320
why it's interesting because ya see your

511
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,909
perspective yeah so it's more like he

512
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,499
gives you the choice it's like you know

513
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:37,119
God's not God doesn't like condemn

514
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:39,220
people Jesus doesn't condemn people but

515
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,799
it's more like you make certain

516
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,259
decisions and there are consequences so

517
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,749
for example I get he's a just Scott so

518
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:47,499
you know if I'm gonna live a life of

519
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:49,509
like killing people

520
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:52,389
obviously there's repercussions right

521
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:54,879
like not just human-made laws but just

522
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:57,399
like the universal law or whatever you

523
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:58,779
know the law that that you know if you

524
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,730
if you operate within Christianity then

525
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:04,480
there's there's judgement right so if

526
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:08,859
you kill people for a living that be a

527
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,590
murderer but or a assassin yeah but you

528
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:12,580
know if you go around and and and live

529
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,159
that kind of life there are

530
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,529
repercussions right you go to jail you

531
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:20,919
don't like you your life will be ruined

532
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:24,009
so um what God's saying if you live a

533
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:26,710
life of faith in you you take that step

534
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:30,549
in learning about me and living the way

535
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:33,970
that that I teach then you'll be in line

536
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:38,679
with like what I want in your life right

537
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:40,090
now like you asked before if God knows

538
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,909
what you're going to do next

539
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,529
Yeah right is that free will does that I

540
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,710
mean for me personally I asked myself

541
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:49,590
that I'm like no I think I have free

542
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:53,350
will because I can make decisions and

543
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:56,140
and I can do whatever I want like like I

544
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:59,049
said like I can go out and treat someone

545
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,539
horribly or I can actually treat them

546
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:04,059
nice so I have that choice but I think

547
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:06,490
it's you don't have that choice though

548
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:08,200
because it's not like God's moving me

549
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,720
like a puppet no break what I'm saying

550
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,799
is with that theory yeah you just said

551
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,690
you had that choice but you're gonna

552
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:16,450
choose to be nice right because that's

553
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,169
what you believe in your brain is right

554
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,559
yeah

555
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:22,360
and God made you that way Yeah right so

556
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,640
isn't he really just controlling so if

557
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,380
he made you that way and you think that

558
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,539
way and you've chose to do the right

559
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,399
thing all the people that God made that

560
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:34,419
chose to do the bad thing he created

561
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:37,330
them to so why would he essentially if

562
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,950
this is if everybody's on god's path why

563
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,020
would God create these other paths I

564
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,990
don't think everybody is on God's path I

565
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,580
think everyone has a choice to live

566
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,370
along you know what what God teaches

567
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,080
versus making a decision to say I know

568
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,539
how do you know this how do you know

569
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,880
that that's do you I mean do you know I

570
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,929
don't but I own that's my feeling are

571
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,330
the other do you feel you have a choice

572
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:04,899
well what I feel is that I think I

573
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:06,760
personally think that the Bible I mean I

574
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,110
don't think I've always wondered like I

575
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,340
yeah the Bible itself is where you're

576
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,080
learning everything that you're talking

577
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,909
about right now correct sure that's

578
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,289
where all of Christianity we're just

579
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:16,360
Christianity not all religion correct

580
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:18,429
all of Christianity on the one I'm most

581
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,870
familiar with and I've been to church a

582
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:23,130
few times but I don't really know it and

583
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:25,990
grow up in it all of Christianity's

584
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:28,390
everything you know pastors everything

585
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:31,480
they know and so on comes from this book

586
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:34,299
and the book like you said is not

587
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,010
written by God right God didn't write it

588
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:38,559
guidance did himself did not write it

589
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,730
but he humans did pointed yeah but you

590
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,770
know how did you learn that you learned

591
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,419
that from the Bible something that

592
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,610
humans wrote so all that information

593
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:47,440
everything that you know about God

594
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,080
everything even the creation of the

595
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,880
Bible is from other humans it's not from

596
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,289
God himself he didn't even in the Bible

597
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,070
it says to go I didn't write the God God

598
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,690
inspired

599
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,550
so that's what Christians actly what I'm

600
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,490
saying so if humans aren't smart enough

601
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:02,170
just like ants not like if humans aren't

602
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,820
smart enough to think on God's level how

603
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,470
do we know that the Bible got it right

604
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,630
completely maybe it's close absolutely

605
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,370
not know I and I don't know all of the

606
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,770
answers but I can give you like my take

607
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:14,320
on what I've kind of learned and it's

608
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:17,800
that first off there are a lot of

609
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:21,040
scholars the brightest minds atheists

610
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:24,010
and non a theists who study the Bible

611
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,930
and look into in really deeply

612
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,880
understand it because it's such a

613
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,010
fascinating book just historically

614
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,050
historically a lot of these artifacts

615
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,120
that are in the Bible there's they're

616
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:38,680
digging up and it matches exactly where

617
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:42,210
it is in the Bible so so factually it's

618
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:45,730
accurate compared to some other you know

619
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,840
what things what things are matching up

620
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,710
what do you mean like you know an

621
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:53,290
example like you know just artifacts or

622
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,900
effects of like you know different like

623
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,310
clay pots and things like that that that

624
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,800
were invented during a certain time

625
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:01,870
period it matches along with the by I

626
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,730
can't be like super accurate fit but I

627
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,590
I've like looked into it but I think

628
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:09,220
it's it says something that there are

629
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:12,880
you know very highly intelligent people

630
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:16,240
who who go to you know dedicate their

631
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,270
entire lives and learning about this

632
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,110
this book right this historical book and

633
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:24,790
it's it's I think at least factually for

634
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,430
me that that is something that's pretty

635
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:29,770
interesting as a logical person right

636
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,970
it's like oh why would if this was a

637
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,430
bogus book why are there so many

638
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:36,550
scholars studying this and in teaching

639
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:39,130
it and continuously you know digging

640
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,050
things up in learning about it so that's

641
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:44,200
number one

642
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:47,100
well on that you know if that's one

643
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,870
reason to believe that this has some

644
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,880
validity to it yeah then what do you

645
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,110
think about other religions and all that

646
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,470
there's tons of people believe in

647
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:58,720
Buddhism who believe in every other

648
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,520
every other religion even Scientology

649
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,750
why do you think if so many people

650
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,640
believe in that not that that's like a

651
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:07,270
minor example but yeah and we all know

652
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,600
that's I mean but that's my point it's

653
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,919
like

654
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,169
yeah just because a lot of people

655
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,210
believe in it doesn't mean that you know

656
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:14,500
just like science right if that's

657
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,660
considered if we consider that a

658
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,980
religion and sure or a belief huh why

659
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,390
does somebody believe in it because

660
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,160
they're taught it from a very young age

661
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,789
so it becomes fact it's not a belief

662
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,289
it's fact

663
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:24,880
yeah and they show you instances just

664
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,530
like in the Bible there's things that

665
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,870
match up they show you instances with

666
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,970
with experiments and say like oh this is

667
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,070
what gravity is and this is because this

668
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,679
has been explained and it we can prove

669
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,570
it right in the Bible it's kind of like

670
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,270
the same thing maybe not as many proofs

671
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:43,419
but we also grew up in a grew up in a

672
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:45,850
society that teaches you science is fact

673
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:47,409
right and some people grew up in

674
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,880
Christianity like yourself and that's

675
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:50,740
fact for you as well

676
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,510
but you know what I'm saying what do you

677
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,799
think about other religions just because

678
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,080
a lot of people believe in it doesn't

679
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:59,440
mean that it's necessarily you know I

680
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,860
mean for you i'ma be asking ya know for

681
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,230
sure I my my whole stance on this is

682
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,750
like everyone is free to believe in

683
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,450
whatever they want I don't mean to make

684
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,539
that sound like a cop-out answer but you

685
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:16,000
know I'm still figuring out Christianity

686
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:19,150
I don't claim to know everything but the

687
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,860
more that I do dive into it the more

688
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:28,230
that I do feel that more connected to it

689
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:31,030
and I do think that it it becomes more

690
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:35,049
more real to me and it makes more sense

691
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:36,909
the deeper I go into it so that's it

692
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,650
into each their own right like I don't

693
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:41,169
want judge someone because they they are

694
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:45,730
a different religion you know or whether

695
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:48,429
there be Islam or Buddhists or whatever

696
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:51,039
right or Catholic like I think everyone

697
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:52,659
whatever makes them feel the way they

698
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,030
you know it brings peace into their

699
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:57,190
lives then yeah you know what do it as

700
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,929
long as you're not hurting people right

701
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:01,780
you can believe in whatever you want and

702
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:06,309
I really believe in the freedom thing

703
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:08,230
like I think you have a choice everybody

704
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:09,580
has a choice but it's which choice are

705
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,860
you gonna make right it applies to

706
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,620
everything in life whether it's religion

707
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,240
or your job or your education or how you

708
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,890
decide to treat people so I think that's

709
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,780
like the most important thing for me

710
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,650
well just for the record - I'm not

711
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:25,110
trying to say

712
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:29,080
I'm anti you're really an time you see

713
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,550
things that I think about yeah and I've

714
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,650
always been afraid I talk to this with

715
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:35,440
Jeremy for a long time Jeremy Jeremy Lin

716
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,540
yeah super Christian and I've talked to

717
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,950
you know he's even asked his pastors and

718
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,290
stuff and there's always it always comes

719
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,090
back down to you just have to have faith

720
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,070
which there's nothing wrong with that

721
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:48,220
but I mean I think it goes to show that

722
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:50,230
there's no hundred percent and I think

723
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,110
it's it's good for people be open-minded

724
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,760
enough to admit that like even even like

725
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,809
scientists I think you shouldn't say

726
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,640
there's no way

727
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:59,410
christiana like even if it's point zero

728
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,980
zero zero zero zero one percent that

729
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:05,140
Christianity our God is real right - in

730
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,750
atheists there's no 100% cuz you don't

731
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,250
know we're not on that level even if you

732
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,650
believe in science and your aliens

733
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,360
there's no way that we would know yeah

734
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,710
absolutely i I totally agree with you I

735
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,330
don't think anything is a hundred

736
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,429
percent but you know there are people

737
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,140
who will say that and believe so

738
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:22,480
strongly in their own religions and in

739
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,429
science right yeah I don't think that's

740
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,970
helpful yeah I think people should be

741
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:30,370
open-minded in and learn about other you

742
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:33,550
know thoughts and beliefs before you

743
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,890
know casting any sort of judgement and I

744
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:37,330
think you know something like your

745
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,490
spiritual walk whatever it may be

746
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:42,250
whichever religion that's a very

747
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,620
personal thing and I think even like

748
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,970
talking about it right now I'm sure

749
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:49,690
there's no Z on Traverse it's gonna be

750
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:51,429
controversy me hate agree so that's like

751
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,960
that's what that's why we're having this

752
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:57,550
you know conversation so I mean I

753
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
obviously know your beliefs right and

754
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,929
you're more confident yours and I I'm

755
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,059
still I'm still learning myself agnostic

756
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:05,980
yeah that's not agnostic as you believe

757
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:08,770
in something yeah but you're not exactly

758
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,090
sure not sure what yeah yeah I mean the

759
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,460
closest thing would be Christianity

760
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,840
because you know might have my family's

761
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,900
Buddhist house Christian but I've only

762
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,410
been to like church it you know cuz I'm

763
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:23,830
Arden and you and I've only been to you

764
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:26,350
know Christian churches but I don't

765
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,670
really I I just don't know you know and

766
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:30,370
that's why I ask because I'm curious

767
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:32,350
yeah it's it's fascinating like the

768
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,090
deeper you get into it I mean you listen

769
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,039
to some of the people who make

770
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,690
case for creation creation there's

771
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:39,700
there's creationist scientists and

772
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,260
there's like non creationist scientists

773
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,590
and that it's pretty interesting to kind

774
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,690
of see how they discuss things and you

775
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:48,669
know there are Christian scientists say

776
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,210
our earth is like ten thousand years old

777
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:52,779
or something

778
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,340
I I don't really know I'm not a

779
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:57,820
scientist so I can't even verify any of

780
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,779
that but whether I don't believe it's

781
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,510
true

782
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:04,870
I feel like it the earth is a little

783
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:07,210
older than that but some of them make a

784
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,370
case and they debate it amongst other

785
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,789
scientists they you know they talk about

786
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:14,169
carbon dating and how the traditional

787
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:16,090
way of carbon dating is actually

788
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:17,649
inaccurate some people argue that and

789
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,120
then some people I don't know I can't I

790
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,049
can't even comment on I don't know what

791
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,279
I'm talking about the science part

792
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:25,210
because let's see what the reason is

793
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:27,580
because and I think why it's become such

794
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,960
a I don't know I people have become so

795
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,240
arrogant about it I feel like more

796
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,850
people more and more obviously just I

797
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,100
feel like Christianity is still huge

798
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,929
obviously right but it was bigger when

799
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,539
we were younger for some reason I just

800
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:42,250
feel like more people now say okay

801
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,390
science is fact cuz we grew up with that

802
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,950
right and a lot of people don't

803
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,620
necessarily I don't know maybe I'm wrong

804
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,480
I I think the majority or for science

805
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,190
now as opposed to like twenty years ago

806
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,730
when we were growing up I actually feel

807
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:56,950
like it's growing you think so yeah at

808
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,539
least from my perspective maybe it's in

809
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,360
your groups do you think that has to do

810
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:03,700
with the progress of science maybe maybe

811
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,140
or like people who are becoming famous

812
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,809
aren't just like you know back in our

813
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,760
day growing up it was like every athlete

814
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:12,159
thanks God everyone gives credit to God

815
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,470
now it's like no deGrasse Tyson and Joe

816
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,090
Rogan and like people who have alternate

817
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,429
alternate theories that aren't just

818
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:21,460
Christian based right even like saying

819
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:22,960
the Pledge of Allegiance and people

820
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,000
having an issue with that it's like that

821
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,470
it's just a different time nobody would

822
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,500
ever come out 20 years ago and be like

823
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,940
my son or daughter does not have to say

824
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,659
to God in the Pledge of Allegiance right

825
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,880
yeah

826
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:37,240
but now that's an issue I I also think

827
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,559
that today in today's time like within

828
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,880
the past you know a few years or

829
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,860
whatever I think Christian has

830
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,559
definitely gotten a bad rep and it has

831
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:47,010
also been misrepresented and I think the

832
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,320
people who comment on

833
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,870
the religion itself are commenting about

834
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:56,100
the people the minority the the people

835
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:58,620
who are in in you know power in churches

836
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,690
and whatnot and the leaders but the

837
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,220
religion itself if you actually research

838
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,190
it it's like with anything right like

839
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,260
people can hear about like rumors about

840
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,149
you but if they don't really know you as

841
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,580
a person right

842
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:15,360
they won't truly understand where you

843
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,830
come from in in it's like the media the

844
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,600
media paints a certain types of type of

845
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,419
picture and I think a lot of people have

846
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,669
done that to Christianity but mostly you

847
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:24,870
know the Christians I know they're not

848
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:26,639
they're not like that it's it's just

849
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:29,610
like a you know in every religion in

850
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:32,279
every belief system there's always you

851
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,409
know bad people in it and there's also a

852
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:36,419
lot of good people so it's it's with any

853
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:39,120
anything like I think it's like I said

854
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:41,130
it's a personal thing so if one is

855
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,929
interested they should dive deep and

856
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,630
learn more as much as they can on their

857
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:51,059
own and I think this is something that a

858
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:53,820
Christian would say is just research and

859
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:57,240
read the Bible and then for yourself

860
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,740
and then just see what what happens you

861
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,289
know like and then maybe you'll

862
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,080
experience something maybe you'll feel

863
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:08,250
something and in maybe that's something

864
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,500
that we can hold on to I guess and see

865
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,269
where that goes I don't know like to

866
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,559
each their own but it's I think

867
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:16,559
Christianity has definitely gotten a bad

868
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:19,860
bad rep definitely in recent times

869
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,799
especially with like you know gay people

870
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,029
and the rise of like equal rights and

871
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,789
stuff like that it's I mean it's

872
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:29,100
associated with it I feel like it's kind

873
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:30,840
of chilled out a little bit yeah but it

874
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,179
was pretty bad to be like it was like

875
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,070
almost like a negative thing to be

876
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,269
Christian for a little bit yeah at least

877
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,639
on social media it maybe he's just in my

878
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:40,529
circle yeah you know like Christianity

879
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:43,889
if you go deep into it it's it's all

880
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:45,299
about love like God is love like and I

881
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:47,820
know that sounds hokey pokey but like

882
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:50,700
it's it that is the message so I think

883
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:53,789
if if people actually look into it and

884
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,740
really dive dive into it like they'll

885
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:57,000
that's what they'll learn not but not

886
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,440
from what everybody else is saying

887
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,360
here's the here's the other thing

888
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,490
other question I have for you I don't

889
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,990
know in the Bible is it wrong to doubt

890
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:09,910
Christianity and is it wrong to think

891
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:13,300
and believe in other religions because I

892
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:16,690
heard that it is um like I said God

893
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:19,390
gives you the choice yeah and will you

894
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:23,230
go to hell if you die believing in

895
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:26,320
another religion or if you die doubting

896
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:28,240
there's a god man according to the Bible

897
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,130
you gotta ask me this tough question I

898
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,780
know a controversial question no but I

899
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:34,120
mean like no I'm asking you specific

900
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,010
yeah yeah be personal come on the by

901
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,870
Bashar it you've learned from your

902
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,429
pastors your own reading yeah do you

903
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,050
believe that the Bible is saying

904
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:44,020
Christianity is saying if you don't

905
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,520
believe in our religion or if you don't

906
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,530
if you don't believe in God then you

907
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,530
will go to hell when you die the short

908
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:53,850
answer is that the in Christianity if

909
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:57,760
you do not believe that Jesus Christ is

910
00:34:53,850 --> 00:35:00,220
your Creator and and is the Messiah the

911
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,190
one who died for your sins then yes

912
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,790
you'll not go to heaven at all Jannetty

913
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,310
right

914
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:08,020
that's what krishna teachers now if

915
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,270
you're asking about my beliefs that is

916
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,950
definitely something that I struggle

917
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,930
with something that I think about a lot

918
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,280
if I'm being really honest and I think

919
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:17,980
it's not just me I think a lot of

920
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,050
Christians thinking that way I would say

921
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,610
most probably thinking that way and

922
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,320
they've they've thought about this sort

923
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:26,140
of thing and struggled with in their own

924
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,730
mind right and I like to think about

925
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,860
both sides like you know there are those

926
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,480
who are very firm like if you're not a

927
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:34,260
Christian you're gonna go to hell right

928
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,520
yeah and and that's one way of

929
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,370
expressing that with what they've

930
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,170
learned the other is more like like me

931
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:44,320
in the middle like I don't know I just

932
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:47,830
don't know right if I can would an all

933
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,690
loving God send people to hell right or

934
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:51,370
allow people to make a decision that's

935
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,870
that's what I'm saying a good decision

936
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,250
to go to hell freeze those people that

937
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:57,280
went to hell too yeah so and like the

938
00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:06,550
other lot like side of me if I if I play

939
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:09,490
devil's f do P if God is a just God

940
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:11,200
right is there such thing as can you can

941
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,800
you feel love without hate can you feel

942
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,930
it can you hate without love right

943
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,460
it's maybe that sort of thing maybe like

944
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,740
those are like the ideas that I think

945
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,410
about in my head yeah or the concepts

946
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:25,640
that really confuse me to be honest but

947
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:27,980
I'd really I can't answer that it's hard

948
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,630
because yeah it sounds evil for me to

949
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,460
answer it that way that's what I'm

950
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,780
saying though like and that's that's why

951
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,240
I bring it up yeah because these are

952
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:38,470
things that I think a lot of people

953
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,700
question yeah and like I said it doesn't

954
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,500
doesn't go anywhere that's why I'm

955
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,450
perfectly fine with anyone believe me

956
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,700
into anything but the people that

957
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:49,220
believe so hardcore and one thing right

958
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,170
like that's the people that I think need

959
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,580
to be a little bit more open-minded I

960
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,170
mean I'm not telling you absolutely to

961
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,450
not believe in what you believe because

962
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,160
everyone has that right and I'm just I

963
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:59,990
don't think you should get scrutiny I'm

964
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,780
defending myself I think you should be

965
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:04,370
scrutinized for questioning those things

966
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,630
I don't think there's anything in the

967
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:07,520
Bible that you know I'm gonna get

968
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:09,860
screwed and so are you feel like being

969
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,630
Christian I'm sorry guys I'm sorry for

970
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,740
everybody and then there's gonna be

971
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,910
people like me who get all the

972
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,730
Christians they're like oh my God he's

973
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,010
so but that's a he's so anti-crime not

974
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,590
trying to disprove make you sound anti

975
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,120
anything I know but you know how people

976
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:24,740
twist words and stuff like that anyway I

977
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,730
just thought it was interesting and I

978
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,460
don't know we never talked about

979
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:30,950
religion I know it's a very it's super

980
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,880
contra not but we're just having a

981
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,020
discussion I don't think there's

982
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,970
anything wrong I've had this discussion

983
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,410
with pastors and they don't maybe they

984
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,440
do hate me after I haven't talked to

985
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:42,200
them since but I think it's interesting

986
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,970
yeah to come from a perspective of

987
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,040
someone who's never been didn't grow up

988
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,540
in the church essentially I don't know

989
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,410
well we did kind of left you out there I

990
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,890
don't know if you have anything to

991
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:55,340
contribute there which one from what

992
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:56,480
topic or what was it just like um I was

993
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,630
just letting you yes you're having like

994
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,010
a really good back and forth now just

995
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,050
asking a lot of questions that I'd I

996
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:04,790
guess don't really have answers it would

997
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,380
be we should just bring on a pastor and

998
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,720
a scientist on the Shane show oh yeah

999
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,640
they'll be amazing all right but we do

1000
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,020
talk about this outside of the podcast

1001
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,090
we do and we have but not necessarily um

1002
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,390
in this much detail yeah I talked about

1003
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:22,010
it

1004
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:24,020
yeah I don't know you're not very

1005
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,950
religious are you wait what are you a

1006
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,750
question

1007
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:28,310
what was it oh just your thoughts about

1008
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:30,860
yeah what are you yeah yeah on the

1009
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:32,420
entire subject yeah just in general this

1010
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,310
kind of it's not really like a science

1011
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,760
versus religion to be yeah it's just me

1012
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:39,320
coming from I'm not even on one side I

1013
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,600
just thought I don't know enough to know

1014
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,310
that's my that's where I'm coming from

1015
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,540
I mean without trying like without I

1016
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,250
mean you guys said so many different

1017
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,790
points that I agree with so I dupes I'd

1018
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,290
rather not like repeat those but yeah my

1019
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:53,030
I'm kind of similar in your sense that I

1020
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,280
didn't grow up be like in a household

1021
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:58,100
that had religion very structured

1022
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,010
religion like I think both of my parents

1023
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:03,260
were mostly Christian or Catholic or

1024
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:06,380
some form of that and we never went to

1025
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,910
church but I think me like growing up my

1026
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:12,110
parents did a good job of instilling

1027
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:15,650
like morals and stuff like that without

1028
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:17,300
religion and then it was kind of up to

1029
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,830
me and I was kind of fortunate enough to

1030
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,320
be able to have friends in different

1031
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:23,900
religions and they could kind of imprint

1032
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,550
positive messages on me you know I mean

1033
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,350
like I had someone who was Sikh I had a

1034
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,950
friend that was Christian and so you

1035
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:32,540
know like it's stuff like love thy

1036
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,880
neighbor and like you know the positive

1037
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:38,360
messages I feel like I was fortunate to

1038
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:42,950
absorb without that's why I don't really

1039
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:44,000
feel that I can even speak unlike a lot

1040
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:47,420
of stuff because I never read the Bible

1041
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,270
like I don't you know I was just asking

1042
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:52,520
questions because if there's an answer

1043
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:55,220
I'm willing to listen yeah for sure and

1044
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,050
it's not me the things I asked for some

1045
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,060
sounds like I'm trying to just poke a

1046
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:01,340
hole in your theory but really that's

1047
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,890
just how I learned no question things I

1048
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:06,920
think that my point of view being that

1049
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:08,360
like that how I grew up I was kind of

1050
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,920
just under the impression of just be

1051
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,760
open-minded like like you were saying or

1052
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,530
you want people have been open-minded

1053
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,690
that's kind of what I grew up as it was

1054
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:16,190
like I was just open-minded to so many

1055
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:18,170
different things around because I was

1056
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,940
fortunate to go to like a school and a

1057
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,100
place I had a lot of different kids with

1058
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:25,340
a lot of different ethnicities and

1059
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,810
religions and so I don't know I mean

1060
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,970
that's I think that's a pretty unique

1061
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:31,250
like I'm not sure like a lot of people

1062
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,740
didn't have that experience and so when

1063
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:38,030
it comes to like me commenting on even

1064
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:39,590
asking of like I don't know about

1065
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:42,860
what was the one that yes David that

1066
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:45,640
said I don't know I'm it's just like I

1067
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:48,440
don't feel like maybe I have the

1068
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,060
experience to talk on that specifically

1069
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,850
so ya know I think like I said

1070
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,650
spirituality in in what you believe is

1071
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,210
really like I said a personal thing is

1072
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,830
yes something that we all have we all go

1073
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,530
through it because we're all gonna die

1074
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:02,090
right like true like I don't know about

1075
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,640
you like how do you feel about like

1076
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:05,420
after you die like what is what is like

1077
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,640
well I want

1078
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,380
I hope happen yeah maybe talk about what

1079
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,910
you hope could potentially happen or

1080
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:14,270
what you think is actually gonna happen

1081
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,040
or I see it I have a struggle between

1082
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,690
kind of like you or you have like a

1083
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,940
logical way of thinking about it and

1084
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,100
there is a part of me that you know it

1085
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,710
could be that the light just go out and

1086
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,510
there's it's not like bad or good it's

1087
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,340
just your existence is no longer right

1088
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:30,620
the neurons in your brain no longer fire

1089
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,790
and that's it it's like you don't have

1090
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,890
any pain you don't have any suffering

1091
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,690
you don't have positive emotions you

1092
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,600
have negative emotions but then there's

1093
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:40,700
a side of me who's been influenced from

1094
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:43,340
the society and culture and religions so

1095
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,470
like that where I think okay well what I

1096
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,270
would hope to happen was that you know

1097
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,220
maybe there is like some form of heaven

1098
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,440
and then it's positive and you show up

1099
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,700
and maybe there's some form of judgment

1100
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,620
but it might not be based on whatever

1101
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,090
religion is maybe it might use I hope

1102
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:58,610
that it's just based on what type of

1103
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,960
person you are right so if there's

1104
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,460
something that judges you that go okay

1105
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,350
how did you live your life did you kill

1106
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,150
people did you help people

1107
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,140
what was your intentions behind doing

1108
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,610
this what was your intentions behind

1109
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,200
doing that and then you get judged on

1110
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:11,000
okay if you're a good person you're in

1111
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,560
this good place right that's kind of

1112
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,510
what I hope happens rather than maybe

1113
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,240
being specifically narrowed into one

1114
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:23,530
religion because I don't know you know

1115
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,790
there's always that question of like how

1116
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:28,550
one thing that I remember questioning

1117
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:30,170
when I was younger was that for people

1118
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,610
who don't have an experienced

1119
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,720
Christianity if they're on the

1120
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,280
completely opposite side of the

1121
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,600
continent and they've never even met

1122
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,480
someone who's Christian or know anything

1123
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,580
about it how did they get into heaven if

1124
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,690
they can't if they've never been

1125
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,540
experienced with it that was one thing

1126
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:46,250
that I struggled with I was like a child

1127
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,930
because I felt like

1128
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,609
you know what let's say how do you

1129
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,619
answer that and then so that that's just

1130
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,540
kind of like me bridging the gap in like

1131
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:55,369
my hopes which is like okay well I hope

1132
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,550
it's just like okay live a good life be

1133
00:42:55,369 --> 00:43:01,150
a good person help people and you'll be

1134
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:03,010
rewarded in the end you know I mean

1135
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:05,480
regardless of what you believe

1136
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,070
specifically in structured religions so

1137
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,230
cuz even like you think about it like

1138
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:11,420
this like even babies that pass away or

1139
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:15,099
like kids that didn't have a chance to

1140
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:17,750
get into like how they cannot accept

1141
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:19,550
Jesus right because it can't comprehend

1142
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:22,250
it mm-hmm they've never had time to

1143
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:25,010
learn it do they go to hell that's the

1144
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,000
rest of things yes go to hell if they

1145
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,349
die as a baby

1146
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,180
you go to hell because you can't accept

1147
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:29,990
Jesus you can't comprehend it I don't I

1148
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,060
don't know what the answer is to that

1149
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,740
trust me isn't sound right trust me

1150
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,420
every Christian has probably thought

1151
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:38,450
about this already let's be an answer

1152
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:40,430
for it there are some answers in

1153
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:43,070
theories but ultimately they are

1154
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,530
theories because we're not God and we

1155
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,210
don't know I think God is a fair God if

1156
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:51,020
there if there's a God is God it would

1157
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:54,320
be a fair God a God of love and but if

1158
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:56,089
but a just God as well so you know it's

1159
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,560
like a it's like a father figure

1160
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:59,420
right the father figure you're not gonna

1161
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,680
you want it you're gonna discipline your

1162
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,450
child if you want them to grow up right

1163
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,609
right you're not gonna just let them do

1164
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:09,260
whatever they want I think in the same

1165
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:11,119
way like sorry what was it mayn't over

1166
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,099
again sorry like if you're saying

1167
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,830
I mean well babies you yeah people

1168
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:19,640
haven't heard so whatever judgment that

1169
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:21,580
they're going to receive that's really

1170
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,680
up to God it's not up to us to really

1171
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:27,470
determine because there's a story in the

1172
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,180
Bible of like this you know when Jesus

1173
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,550
was crucified there were two people next

1174
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:35,450
to him they were both robbers in one of

1175
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:36,650
them you know was a criminal like he was

1176
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:41,150
being hung there because it was a

1177
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:43,099
criminal and you know he asked you know

1178
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,630
one of them was like ridiculing Jesus

1179
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:45,950
and then the other one was like hey

1180
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:49,040
don't really kill him he's a good he was

1181
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:52,339
a good man and and Jesus basically told

1182
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,650
the guy who like defended him I'd say

1183
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:57,800
I'm gonna see you in heaven like mmm

1184
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,140
it's so it's like

1185
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,869
you have that choice like like I said it

1186
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:06,020
comes down to that in and if I'm being

1187
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:09,320
honest like would I say that my choice

1188
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:12,740
in diving deep deeper into this religion

1189
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,210
is out of fear in the beginning yes it

1190
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,390
was a little bit I didn't want to go to

1191
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:20,290
hell right but the more that I learn

1192
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:23,210
about it the more that I find that it's

1193
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:28,160
less about heaven and hell it's more

1194
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:30,380
about feeling peace and in every

1195
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,290
circumstance whether it's good or bad

1196
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:36,740
it's a learning experience and it's also

1197
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:39,110
learning more about this being that's

1198
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:41,930
out here or here or wherever it is right

1199
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:43,700
just here that created like why am I

1200
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,410
here like that's the big question I have

1201
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:49,010
for myself is what am I supposed to be

1202
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:51,260
doing you know I just met a guy who sold

1203
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:53,150
a company in China for like nine hundred

1204
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:56,660
million dollars he's like yeah I spent

1205
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:58,910
six months just spending money and I was

1206
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:01,100
I got really depressed it's like what am

1207
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:03,590
what did he do now now he's like

1208
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,760
starting like an education

1209
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,440
yeah he's and stuff because he wants to

1210
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,450
help people so that's what he found out

1211
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,359
in those six months like now that I have

1212
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:13,220
reached the goal right I've talked about

1213
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,619
this before too like once you get to a

1214
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,030
certain level of you know what you

1215
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:19,760
always thought you wanted and you get

1216
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:22,850
that then you start to think about oh

1217
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,350
well that's not enough yeah so happy

1218
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:28,040
exactly so what the Bible teaches is

1219
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:31,100
that like just be grateful in every

1220
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,300
circumstance right whether things are

1221
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,100
good or whether things are bad because

1222
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:38,090
that's the only way to remain truly

1223
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:40,160
fulfilled in life because none of these

1224
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,869
material things will ever bring you joy

1225
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,500
now are they are they there too for you

1226
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:46,490
to enjoy yes of course but and there's

1227
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,280
nothing in the Bible that tells you you

1228
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:53,300
can't enjoy things right but it's more

1229
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,190
about your along the journey what how

1230
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:58,880
does this religion play a part in your

1231
00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:01,400
life and like I said if Buddhism is what

1232
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,600
gets you through life or Catholicism or

1233
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:08,390
if you're if you're Islam like yeah if

1234
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:11,700
that's what it is then then go for it

1235
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:14,490
but to each their own

1236
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:16,650
well that was turned into a very

1237
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:18,660
controversial I don't know if it's

1238
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:20,819
controversial actually yeah it's just a

1239
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,609
topic that you know it's gonna trigger

1240
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:25,740
some people yeah I mean hard list yeah

1241
00:47:22,609 --> 00:47:27,809
my intention is not to offend anybody

1242
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,819
like I said in terms of Christianity I'm

1243
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:32,670
still on this journey I'm still learning

1244
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:35,309
right and I do time to time look into

1245
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,690
other religions to just researching and

1246
00:47:35,309 --> 00:47:38,099
seeing what you're gonna get you don't

1247
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:42,990
have to put a disclaimer you're gonna

1248
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:44,910
get the heat I know it's all my yeah I'm

1249
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:46,260
okay yeah you'd be fine you're just you

1250
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:49,500
didn't say anything really controversial

1251
00:47:46,260 --> 00:48:03,000
yeah so anyway we're gonna take a quick

1252
00:47:49,500 --> 00:48:05,880
break and we'll be back and we're back

1253
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:12,540
and we're back and we're back so on a

1254
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:14,640
less serious topic I mean yeah I know it

1255
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:16,290
was very interesting yeah no I mean I

1256
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,549
don't say a lot of people but I do think

1257
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:22,260
there is a correlation that people have

1258
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:24,869
with being uncomfortable talking about

1259
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:26,700
religion and especially with people that

1260
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:29,760
have different views you know and not to

1261
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:31,770
say that ours are different but I don't

1262
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,369
know I think it's cool to hear different

1263
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:34,710
perspectives

1264
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:38,809

gonna be its again it's it's us trying

1275
00:48:59,549 --> 00:49:03,869
to prove that we can sell and we have

1276
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,700
been so thank you guys for that but it's

1277
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:08,010
you guys some work to in order to

1278
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:10,490
convince them I've had multiple people

1279
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:14,099
and I actually like it when they ask me

1280
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:18,630
like what's your unlike unbiased opinion

1281
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:21,720
right and it's I mean legitimately it's

1282
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:24,869
it's delicious it's good it isn't make

1283
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,650
you feel super wired like does it make

1284
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:27,390
you feel jittery

1285
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:29,730
but it gives you like for me at least

1286
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:31,499
the amount of caffeine that like amount

1287
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:33,960
a cup of coffee which is perfect you

1288
00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:36,839
know doesn't make it it's like not as

1289
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,279
acidic you know some sometimes energy

1290
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:40,829
drinks can be super acidic that's kind

1291
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:42,690
of the goal shouldn't go for yeah smooth

1292
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:45,359
the number one complaint I get is that

1293
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:48,960
oh why can't you make a dairy-free

1294
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:51,569
option right right honestly I don't know

1295
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,970
if I can legally say this but like I've

1296
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:55,859
been told from other people cuz I can't

1297
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:58,680
say personally from the brands

1298
00:49:55,859 --> 00:50:00,359
perspective uh-huh that they are lactose

1299
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,829
intolerant they drank a can and they

1300
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:04,289
were fine yeah that's what I was told

1301
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:07,920
for Mike my brother his which i'ma call

1302
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:09,869
his fiancee's super like lactose

1303
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,859
intolerant yeah she can drink it

1304
00:50:09,869 --> 00:50:16,019
brothers the same way my mom too

1305
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:17,160
I don't know why maybe I am maybe that's

1306
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:19,289
why I'm gassy all the time cuz I

1307
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,269
shouldn't be eating like cheese and

1308
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:24,660
stuff like that do you think it could be

1309
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:27,660
because the milk is not American milk

1310
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:29,249
it's European milk maybe it's just

1311
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,499
bitten it's just a small amount it's

1312
00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:32,970
such a tiny amount of milk that I don't

1313
00:50:31,499 --> 00:50:34,829
know I don't know I don't want to get in

1314
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:36,359
trouble by saying that but I have heard

1315
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:37,650
I haven't heard complains that people

1316
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:40,739
who drank it that are lactose intolerant

1317
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:42,299
having like bad really bad breakdowns or

1318
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:45,210
whatever whatever it's called flare-ups

1319
00:50:42,299 --> 00:50:47,009
tolerance I don't know I don't know I

1320
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:49,319
don't know why we're doing turning into

1321
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:52,470
a commercial but yeah walmart.com go and

1322
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:55,200
slash ninja milk I don't know if that's

1323
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:57,210
right I don't know if it's on there yeah

1324
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,519
yeah it's on Walmart site and if not

1325
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:03,119
then you can go to Ninja calm I'm

1326
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:06,779
curious to all the listeners on off the

1327
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,880
pill what is your what are you what are

1328
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:11,069
your religious beliefs and what do you

1329
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,140
believe in you brought it back comment

1330
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:15,059
in comment below no cuz I'm curious oh

1331
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,130
yeah because this is this is a topic

1332
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:18,480
that's I know it's controversial but

1333
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,029
it's also very fun for me to talk about

1334
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,890
because it's is it did we say anything

1335
00:51:21,029 --> 00:51:24,359
controversial though and I don't even

1336
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:27,049
know if I would I mean I get what you're

1337
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:33,329
saying when you say it's controversial

1338
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:35,549
but is it no I get what he's saying but

1339
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:37,559
I don't know I don't think it is we

1340
00:51:35,549 --> 00:51:39,480
didn't say like one or the other like oh

1341
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:41,760
this is what you should believe in yeah

1342
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,640
I think there is asking questions true

1343
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,470
unless that's wrong which I don't think

1344
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,840
in today's society it is wrong today's

1345
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,980
questions I have doubt and not believe

1346
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,110
and like you were saying it's like

1347
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:54,180
questions you would ask a pastor yeah

1348
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:58,200
and in my dating game effective I would

1349
00:51:54,180 --> 00:52:00,390
I would say that's what that's for is

1350
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,460
like you know going to your pastor and

1351
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:04,200
having any conflicts yeah exactly

1352
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:07,440
and so I don't know and even attached

1353
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,700
themselves they questioned everything to

1354
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,280
just the same things at all

1355
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,840
intellectuals question they have to

1356
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,730
question themselves otherwise they would

1357
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,800
be hypocrites right yeah I hope I'm

1358
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:19,950
teaching this this religion but they

1359
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,380
believe in it so much that they they are

1360
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:25,170
so convinced because of how much they

1361
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,510
have learned and experienced that they

1362
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:28,800
feel compelled to teach it but they

1363
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,700
don't know the answers either nobody

1364
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,940
knows all the answers everything

1365
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:36,510
otherwise we'd be good so I mean with

1366
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:38,970
that belief technically technically like

1367
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:42,930
what we're saying is as much as I grew

1368
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:45,840
up and I believe the theory of science

1369
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:48,120
right does that make sense

1370
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,740
yeah I think science is a theory in in

1371
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,030
general right it's not like we said

1372
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,220
there's no hundred percent yeah it's

1373
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:54,930
very fact its fact there's scientific

1374
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,530
fact but it's still scientific fact not

1375
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,240
mmm-hmm

1376
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:59,070
you know I'm saying I mean I think a

1377
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,110
fact is a fact well though I've seen

1378
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,630
theories and facts within science yeah

1379
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:06,360
yeah but that we're just arguing almost

1380
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:07,860
just the words behind it right yeah it's

1381
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,450
not like but you know what I mean right

1382
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:13,410
there's no hundred percent we kind of

1383
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:16,290
discussed that like should I forgot who

1384
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,850
said it but anyway with science like

1385
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:20,010
let's say all of a sudden for all of

1386
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:22,020
time that we remember if you drop pick

1387
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:24,000
up an apple and drop it gravity because

1388
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:26,640
of gravity it'll fall right it'll fall

1389
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,120
and hit the floor for how many years

1390
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:32,790
have we believed in gravity or have we

1391
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:34,080
documented this what if one day for

1392
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,550
whatever reason someone picks up an

1393
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,200
apple drops it and it doesn't hit the

1394
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:39,390
floor then all of a sudden what gravity

1395
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:43,140
is not a thing is there an explanation

1396
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:44,820
for that or is or we didn't completely

1397
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,590
understand it it's not a long enough

1398
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:49,710
period of time that humans have been

1399
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:52,800
able to I guess investigate into science

1400
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:56,100
I think I know your your sirness

1401
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,890
I think I'm really confusing myself I

1402
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:03,950
think in terms of like gravity and stuff

1403
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:06,540
yeah I think the formulas have been

1404
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:09,950
proven they've been proven because it

1405
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:12,150
happens every single time you plug in

1406
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:13,530
every it works out every single time

1407
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:16,950
right I'm just saying hypothetically

1408
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:20,340
yeah but there's no infinite calculator

1409
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:22,700
that shows the what am I trying to say

1410
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:27,420
so you use the result like let's say a

1411
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:29,490
hundred million billion years from now

1412
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,950
someone drops an apple and it doesn't

1413
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:33,960
fall and it disproves the theory of

1414
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:36,000
gravity that means gravity was never a

1415
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,830
hundred percent fact and who's gonna say

1416
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,540
that it will in a hundred billion years

1417
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,950
maybe it might change maybe it never

1418
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,540
really was there may be something else

1419
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,280
that we don't know that we didn't

1420
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,800
discover is actually causing this

1421
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,150
phenomena that's all I'm saying I know

1422
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,710
it sounds super out there but I'm just

1423
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:53,450
giving that perspective of like that is

1424
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:56,610
a tiniest even if I don't if even if I'm

1425
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:59,040
0.001 percent believing that there's a

1426
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:03,020
possibility absolutely and I think like

1427
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:05,430
I mean and you know what I think that I

1428
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:08,490
might be wrong maybe a scientist can

1429
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:09,870
come tell me but like I think life is

1430
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:13,650
about believing in what you've

1431
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:16,010
experienced yeah and I mean if we think

1432
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:20,640
like that about everything in life then

1433
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:22,800
you can't live it's like it just becomes

1434
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,840
a choice is because I kind of I I've

1435
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,450
seen things far enough to understand

1436
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,100
I've learned what explains this reason

1437
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,660
why things fall to the ground I mean

1438
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,030
wasn't Einstein wrong about gravity

1439
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:37,140
initially I could be your thing at the

1440
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:38,550
wrong person I think I think I'm kind of

1441
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,740
following what you're saying yeah let's

1442
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:42,810
get a scientists on I really do want to

1443
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:45,570
get I've always want to get had my

1444
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:47,490
physics teacher back in Hawaii oh and

1445
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:50,820
actually about biology teacher that I

1446
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:52,110
really like but there's two teachers

1447
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,210
that I've always wanted to have on the

1448
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:55,590
podcast when I would make that happen

1449
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:58,050
because they're both teachers in Hawaii

1450
00:55:55,590 --> 00:56:00,390
to two of them I like and I just wanted

1451
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,320
I don't have a bunch of random questions

1452
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,710
like this that I would just like to

1453
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,180
answer

1454
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:04,560
same thing for with a pastor I would

1455
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,750
like to ask

1456
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:09,000

1458
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,590
at what they do and they know everything

1459
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,910
yeah I'd love to just like question him

1460
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:16,200
that would be a lot of fun all right

1461
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,880
well if you're a really really

1462
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,080
knowledgeable pastor out there or

1463
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,200
science teacher don't want to be on the

1464
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:24,480
show and you have some credibility we're

1465
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,150

1466
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,920

Twitter and at off the pill podcast and

1469
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:37,800

them though because what if they're like

1471
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:43,710
Justice I don't want some crazy person

1472
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:45,270
I don't know I'm open to I think we

1473
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:46,620
should start expanding to not just our

1474
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:48,360
friend group but people that are just

1475
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:50,070
like interesting thought leaders yeah

1476
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:52,710
yeah you guys could also recommend who

1477
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:55,040
you guys want us to reach out to as well

1478
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:56,970

anyway yeah this this went in a

1482
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:09,030
direction I wasn't expecting we started

1483
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:11,100
off with area 51 I made our way to

1484
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:14,820
aliens aliens controlling a simulation

1485
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:20,130
simulation first I guess science versus

1486
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:22,020
religion yep I wasn't planning on that

1487
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:27,410
but uh that's the way the cookie

1488
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:30,570
crumbled so and it crumbled all right I

1489
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:33,300
