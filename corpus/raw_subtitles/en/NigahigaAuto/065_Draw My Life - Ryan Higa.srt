1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,419
so I was never gonna do a draw my life

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,859
video because to be honest I personally

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,660
don't think my life is nearly as

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,730
dramatic or interesting as some of the

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,800
other draw my life's that I've seen but

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,620
because a couple of you keep asking well

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,480
maybe more than a couple of you I am

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,789
going to draw my life or at least what I

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,430
call drawings you'll see it all started

10
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,320
off on June 6 1990 I was born in Hilo

11
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,910
Hawaii a small town where I grew up I

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,439
was lucky enough to have two loving

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,119
parents that I look up to even till

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,710
today I also have an older brother who

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,310
I've always felt competitive with my

16
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,449
whole life

17
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,529
he was always better than me and

18
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,440
everything he would beat me and

19
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,180
challenges competitions video games and

20
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,030
of course he was naturally gifted in

21
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,620
judo sea judo played a big part in my

22
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,570
family being that both my brother and I

23
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,640
pretty much did it our whole lives well

24
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,230
at age 5 when I first started I hated

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,489
you too because I was terrible at my

26
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,100
brother on the other hand was like a

27
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,690
judo club star pupil all of our senses

28
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,000
or teachers for those of you that don't

29
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,230
speak French loved him I was probably on

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the exact opposite side of the spectrum

31
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,770
anyway my brother would almost always

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,270
win at every tournament we entered while

33
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,370
I on the other hand would be lucky to

34
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,049
place third out of three people that is

35
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,030
I remember specifically hearing at a

36
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,369
tournament a man say oh this is the

37
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,720
younger Higa not the good one but I

38
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,520
couldn't even get mad because it was

39
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,320
true anyway in elementary school from

40
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,549
kindergarten to fifth grade I really

41
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,009
don't remember much all they can

42
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,200
remember is that I hated judo and I had

43
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,240
the hugest crush on a girl not gonna say

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,920
her real name but let's call her Nichole

45
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,720
I was pretty much in love with Nicole or

46
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,850
at least what a seven-year-old thinks

47
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,770
love is but I was too shy and scared to

48
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,720
say anything to her until years later

49
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,310
but we'll come across that later after

50
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,840
fifth grade I moved schools for middle

51
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,850
school sixth grade was specifically a

52
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,049
terrible year for me not only did I lose

53
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,729
all my friends because it was a new

54
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,799
school but because it was a charter

55
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,570
school we all had to take tests to see

56
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,070
where we would be placed I guess and for

57
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,810
some reason I got placed with the older

58
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,130
kids at the time I thought this was a

59
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,450
good thing because I thought older kids

60
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,310
would think I'm cool because I skipped a

61
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,680
grade however it was pretty much the

62
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,579
opposite so this is the part of story

63
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,140
that most of you don't know about

64
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,969
because I've never really addressed it

65
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,759
publicly but I know a lot of you

66
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,740
watching this can relate so I got

67
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,420
bullied a lot you know nothing really

68
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,250
crazy just your typical getting pushed

69
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,049
down to the ground being made fun of for

70
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,610
no reason and yes I remember every

71
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,319
single one of them including the worst

72
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,030
of them again not going to use a real

73
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,020
name but we'll call him Richard because

74
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,970
as you know another

75
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,770
richard is dick see dick was such a

76
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,720
Richard to me that I'd actually make

77
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,910
excuses to my mom why I couldn't go to

78
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,530
school or why I needed to change schools

79
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,120
so I was heating life at the time and

80
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,250
wondering why someone so mean could be

81
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,540
so popular by picking on me even got to

82
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,580
the point where I had some darker

83
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,440
thoughts at the time that I think most

84
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,180
if not all teenagers go through at some

85
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,350
point in their lives or perhaps it was

86
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,270
just puberty messing with my head I

87
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,950
don't know however I was able to stick

88
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,480
it out and I actually found a way to end

89
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,860
the bullying on my own terms I noticed

90
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,420
that the reason dick was bullying me was

91
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,250
to make people laugh so I figured that

92
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,810
if I could make them laugh and become

93
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,370
the funny guy they would stop treating

94
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,170
me like I was less than them and

95
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,790
surprisingly it worked every time they

96
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,200
made fun of me I ran within and I made

97
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,910
fun of myself even more than they could

98
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,410
kind of like that last rap battle that

99
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,150
Eminem did an eight-mile except that

100
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,400
movie didn't exist at the time so he

101
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,600
pretty much stole my idea it's all good

102
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,730
though me and I'm never like best

103
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,230
friends forever now I still didn't have

104
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,970
many friends but at least I wasn't

105
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,680
getting bullied anymore but from that

106
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,510
point on I wanted to be funny I started

107
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,460
picking up my mom's VHS camcorder and

108
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,230
recording little skits and videos for my

109
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,610
family to watch they loved it of course

110
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,710
some of my cousin's would be like you

111
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,150
need to get a life Ryan but it became a

112
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,680
traditional thing every Sunday I'd have

113
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,600
a new video for them to watch and laugh

114
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,830
at in eighth grade I finally reconnected

115
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,660
with Nicole you know the girl I had a

116
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,800
crush on since elementary school she was

117
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,480
still at the other middle school where

118
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,070
all my friends were but I somehow became

119
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,330
in contact with her again through MSN

120
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,410
Messenger a lot of you might not know

121
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,150
what that is now but it was like the

122
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,620
Facebook of that time but when I finally

123
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,080
had the courage to ask her out I got

124
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,390
completely rejected no explanation no

125
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,250
excuse just a straight-up no nothing

126
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,900
more and I'm not gonna lie that bothered

127
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,209
me for a long time you didn't just make

128
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,950
me sad it made me very unconfident it

129
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,510
was devastating to me at the time then

130
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,490
in high school came around up until that

131
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,890
point I considered myself a complete

132
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,110
loser I always saw myself as less than

133
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,670
everyone Nicole got a boyfriend I was

134
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,140
less than him my old elementary school

135
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,790
friends had found new friends and they

136
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,140
became close with I was less than them

137
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,610
my brother who had just left for college

138
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,590
not only left high school with honors

139
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,270
but he ended up placing second in the

140
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,160
state for high school judo which as you

141
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,870
know and my family is a big deal so yeah

142
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,209
I was less than him too

143
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,830
that was back at square one I had a few

144
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,600
acquaintances but little to no close

145
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,640
friends even the kids I considered nerds

146
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,380
had friends they had each other in my

147
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,210
mind I wasn't anybody I was less than

148
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,650
everyone I looked forward to class more

149
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,389
than recess and lunch because at least

150
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,639
that way I could sit somewhere and not

151
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,319
complete loner and then it happened one

152
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,629
of the most momentous occasions of my

153
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,770
life I joined the wrestling team and I

154
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,930
know what you're thinking wrestling is

155
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,430
just a sport well to me it wasn't it

156
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,340
literally changed my life and well

157
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,139
almost ended at the same time I remember

158
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,490
this one time I had to lose roughly 16

159
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,439
pounds in a week to make my weight class

160
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,879
this was by far the most I've ever had

161
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,770
to lose in such a short amount of time

162
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,870
so I discipline myself to survive I'm

163
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,699
half a can of tuna and roughly 32 ounces

164
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,199
of water a day pretty sure I would have

165
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,150
died had my teammate landing that

166
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,590
finally collapsed on a run sorry mom

167
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,729
just finding out about this now was

168
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,229
probably one of the hardest things I've

169
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,789
ever had to do in my life but it was by

170
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:01,379
my own choice just to prove to myself

171
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:03,509
that anything can be done with enough

172
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,919
effort sure enough I made it to 102

173
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:06,750
pounds a whole pond under my weight

174
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,460
class from that point on I felt like a

175
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,199
completely new person I didn't feel like

176
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,879
a loser anymore I felt like I could get

177
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,229
anything I want to do in life as long as

178
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,490
I put the work by the time high school

179
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,259
was over I was lucky enough to earn a

180
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,969
state championship wrestling title and

181
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,979
just like my brother second in the state

182
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:21,419
for judo even with a dislocated elbow I

183
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,889
had lots of friends most of which were

184
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,599
fellow wrestlers you might recognize

185
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,909
some of them for my videos I even had a

186
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,680
girlfriend no not Nicole someone that I

187
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,750
thought was even more beautiful perfect

188
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,370
oh and those videos I made for my family

189
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,870
every Sunday I decided to start putting

190
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,339
them on this website called YouTube so I

191
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,199
wouldn't have to physically bring them a

192
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,610
copy and little did I know a few other

193
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,870
people found them and started sharing

194
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,520
them as well before I knew it I was

195
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,960
consistently getting thousands of views

196
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,839
every day and comments kept telling me

197
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,129
to do it so again however my parents

198
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,620
really wanted me to get a college degree

199
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:51,750
so for the first time in my life I left

200
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,000
Hawaii to attend UNLV for a degree in

201
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,110
nuclear medicine I hated it I was

202
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,399
spending most of my days and nights

203
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,139
learning about something I had no

204
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,729
interest in the workload between college

205
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,379
and posting YouTube videos just became

206
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:03,149
too much and my girlfriend remained in

207
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,620
Hawaii so the long-distance thing wasn't

208
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:06,360
helping either I realized that once

209
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,979
again I was completely stressed out and

210
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,779
I'm happy so after about two years into

211
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,219
college my girlfriend and I broke up and

212
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,719
I finally ended up telling my parents

213
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,490
that I'm dropping out to pursue this

214
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:16,439
YouTube thing it took a little while but

215
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,270
to my surprise they became completely

216
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,159
supportive and because of that thanks to

217
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,750
my parents thanks to wrestling thanks to

218
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,520
my bullies thanks to not only the good

219
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,719
but the bad experiences in my life and

220
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,729
of course thanks to all of you watching

221
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:28,409
right now I am Who I am today because of

222
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,680
all of you like everyone I still go

223
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:32,630
through highs and lows but ultimately

224
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,190
completely happy this is my real life

225
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,870
story no I'm not telling you this

226
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,550
because I want to brag about my life or

227
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,840
because I want you to feel sorry for me

228
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,370
because I was bullied when I was younger

229
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,600
or whatever I'm telling you this story

230
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,740
because I know for a fact that there are

231
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,270
a lot of you watching this right now

232
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,500
that are going through the same things I

233
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,180
went through when I was younger and I

234
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,830
wanted to let you know that life will

235
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,930
get better if you choose to make it

236
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,250
better it's okay to be sad and angry now

237
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,630
and then there are some things that may

238
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,310
be out of your control like employee

239
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,750
that picks on you or a boy or girl that

240
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,880
rejects you or even a sibling that

241
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,220
outshines you but the one thing that you

242
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,870
and only you control is your perspective

243
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,550
and your actions being depressed and

244
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,169
feeling sorry for yourself it's easy I

245
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,509
challenge you to change that today

246
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,250
happiness is a choice choose to be happy

247
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:12,289
choose to better your life because only

248
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,180
you can make that decision you are not

249
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:15,830
less than anyone there are only two

250
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,720
things that can stop you your own mind

251
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,190
and your own body some might argue that

252
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,539
there's a third and say your heart as

253
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,460
well but if you've been on my channel

254
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:25,630
long enough you already know that even

255
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:32,850
with heart it's still less than three

256
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:32,850
