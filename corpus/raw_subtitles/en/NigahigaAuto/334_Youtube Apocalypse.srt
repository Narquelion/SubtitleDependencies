00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:09,120

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,800
why the long face bad jokes Brian that's

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,030
a bad way to start a video hey guys so

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,070
something a little fishy has been

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,109
happening on YouTube lady and I just

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,699
wanted up I'm sorry could I please get

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,630
rid of this stupid joke who wrote this

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,010
anyway I didn't which is also you Oh

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,750
that our good one

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,580
anyway back to the YouTube fishiness I

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,949
posted a video last week and usually

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,660
after I post a video I gain about $5 an

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,850
hour more subscribers but over the past

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,590
week I lost about a hundred thousand

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,480
subscribers so I was like there you guys

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,980
really did not like that video but then

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,660
I checked I saw the other youtubers like

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,059
Smosh and Shane Dawson and

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,860
raywilliamjohnson and other on since

20
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,450
we're losing subscribers as well every

21
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,520
day we're losing more and more and we

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,980
just keep falling deeper and deeper into

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,140
this whole pad so she said run for once

24
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,399
I finally make my first serious video

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,109
and and you're treating this like it's

26
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,090
some big joke so why is this happening

27
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,440
YouTube is once again deleting YouTube

28
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,850
accounts so instead of deleting just

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,780
inactive account I've been getting a lot

30
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,189
of comments and tweets from people

31
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,350
saying that they've been automatically

32
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,939
unsubscribed to some of their favorite

33
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,990
channels that they go to every day have

34
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,159
you ever thought that people just don't

35
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,600
want to subscribe to you guys anymore

36
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,430
well then that would be just one big

37
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,140
sudden coincidence and then we don't

38
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,530
believe in coincidences right dr. house

39
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,060
I agree but on a real serious note I

40
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,500
appreciate every single one of my

41
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,240
subscribers but that's not the reason

42
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,340
why I started making videos I didn't do

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,350
it to gain subscribers or to make money

44
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,600
or to gain popularity I did it because

45
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,280
it was fun so just so you guys know I am

46
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,840
never gonna stop making videos even if I

47
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,570
lose all my subscribers I will never

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,060
back down I will never say never except

49
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,950
for those past few times I will not stop

50
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,700
making videos good as nothing in this

51
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,700
world it can stop

52
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,619
and don't worry guys all the paper you

53
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:57,210
saw me using this videos is going to be

54
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:59,070

55
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,689

56
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,220
