1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
hey guys so this is not gonna be one of

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,290
my typical videos on this channel and

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,460
the reason for that is because a good

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,080
friend of mine in general Marley's

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,639
actually not her but her boyfriend

6
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,570
Julian gave me a call and told me that

7
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,070
he's gonna throw a surprise birthday

8
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,450
party for her and then we got all

9
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,700
excited and said hey let's throw a

10
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,350
performance for her not thinking how

11
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,050
long that would take to create and and

12
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,699
learn and then also we'd have to perform

13
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,199
it being that I'm not a dancer or a

14
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,000
performer of any kind but here's the

15
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,350
twist it actually became a much more

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,480
difficult challenge than this was

17
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,920
supposed to be a little over 24 hours we

18
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,689
have to create a performance create the

19
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,130
music for the performance learn the

20
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,380
