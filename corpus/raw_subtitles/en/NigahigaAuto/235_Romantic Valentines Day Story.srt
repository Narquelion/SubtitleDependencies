7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,359
couples and all that stuff but why is

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,980
there a specific date to celebrate that

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,810
if you really love someone shouldn't

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,949
every day be like Valentine's Day for

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,260
all you girls out there wouldn't you

12
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,130
rather get flowers and a random

13
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,420
unexpected day rather than a day that

14
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,949
you're supposed to get them and for you

15
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,689

16
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,700
expectation to get girls flowers on that

day anyway you can't even use flowers

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,059

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,860
useful like an iron or a kite or

20
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,480
