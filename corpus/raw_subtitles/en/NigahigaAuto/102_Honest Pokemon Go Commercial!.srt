1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,830
ah hey guys so you probably already

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,150
heard all the hype from Pokemon buh-bye

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,280
now unless you've been living under a

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,139
Geodude it's literally everywhere

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,250
YouTube Facebook Twitter Instagram and

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,750
that's just online turn off your

7
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,490
computer they're talking about it on TV

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,780
if you go outside to a park or grocery

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,460
store or anything public there's

10
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,080
probably people playing there too I mean

11
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,400
there's been so much hype around pokemon

12
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,390
gold that I've been starting to see it

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,390
in places that it's not

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:52,220
[Music]

15
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:53,900
what don't act like you wouldn't catch

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,550
her - I mean she's still rares better

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,410
than catching another Taylor Swift again

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,269
so there is around here and no before

19
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,619
you Swift these jump to conclusions I'm

20
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,879
not saying Taylor Swift as a Rattata

21
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:05,150
because she looks like a wrath Rattata

22
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:06,440
ratata rock taka it's a vine meme she's

23
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,729
a Rattata because ratandas are

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,320
everywhere and even if you don't want to

25
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:11,390
see or hear another one you're still

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,920
going to and also because Rattata can

27
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,600
learn the ability Swift and just like

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,979
Taylor Swift it might not be the best

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,900
attack but it's still gonna be a hit

30
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:20,090
because Swift doesn't miss ok enough

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,040
Pokemon jargon jargon I don't know why I

32
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,860
use that word I've never used that word

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,710
before it sounds like a Pokemon door guy

34
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,250
again Jon Jon see this is exactly what

35
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,320
I'm talking about

36
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,030
it is the 90s again and it is all about

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,830
Pokemon it has taken over the world

38
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,180
again and this time around it's not

39
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,650
something to be ashamed of I mean when I

40
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,820
play Pokemon and collective Pokemon

41
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,220
cards as a kid I had to do it like

42
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,350
almost in secret because back then like

43
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,040
Pokemon with me make you a nerd it made

44
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,420
you uncoil and the chairs well we now

45
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,210
live in a day and age we're playing

46
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,830
Pokemon does not make you up well I mean

47
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,750
we're all still nerds but there's more

48
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,220
of us now Pokemon goal has once again

49
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,510
made Pokemon the biggest thing in the

50
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,190
world right now and no one should be

51
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,570
happier about it than me I've always

52
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,490
been a super Pokemon fan I mean I played

53
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,830
all the games from the beginning pokemon

54
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,240
red blue green yellow or pokemon snap

55
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,920
with one pin ball I watched every

56
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,300
episode of Pokemon that was on TV I even

57
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,040
had the Pokemon soundtrack so that I

58
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,780
could memorize all the songs not a part

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,610
of my life I'm particularly proud of but

60
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,769
you need to know how big of a Pokemon

61
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,000
fan I am in order to truly understand me

62
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:22,110
when I say this I'm not trying to be a

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,970
hater or a Down or anything

64
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,070
I can't be the only one who absolutely

65
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:36,660
loves Pokemon that doesn't love Pokemon

66
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:40,640
go you're just jumping oh I forgot to

67
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:43,230
pin the black bars and now the text

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,850
pretty accurate look I don't hit the

69
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,590
game but in my honest opinion I was a

70
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,150
little disappointed especially after all

71
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,230
the commercials they put on that - you

72
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,060
know to get all of everybody excited

73
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,890
about it and trust me I had normal

74
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,270
expectations I wasn't expecting the game

75
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,670
to look like the commercial just an

76
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,500
unrealistic expectation well maybe not I

77
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,050
mean there's virtual reality now but to

78
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,430
go from this to this it's a little

79
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,959
misleading I still think it's a great

80
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,580
idea and I know this game took like 10

81
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,959
or 20 years to get done but I think it

82
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,340
still wasn't ready to be released the

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,720
way I see it it's not even really a

84
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,030
Pokemon game it's like Google Maps

85
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,000
styled with a Pokemon it's pokemons

86
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,200
lease like Pokemon get what am i singing

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,090
that did not make sense how do I

88
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,200
describe this better in 2016

89
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,330
Oh Pokemon goal is basically Google Maps

90
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,560
mixed with Foursquare with a Pokemon

91
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,459
snapchat filter on it

92
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:34,370
BAM with no chill lint

93
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,370
savage FINA turnt up Oh

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,900
see I'm still hip but you know what it's

95
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,430
not even the look about Pokemon glow

96
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,959
that bothers me I can get past that it's

97
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,400
the fact that half the time you can't

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,350
even sign into the game because the

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,299
servers are down or they're experiencing

100
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,830
difficulties and maybe it's just me but

101
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,030
even when you can sign in when you're

102
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,100
playing the game it just freezes

103
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,450
randomly especially for some reason when

104
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,070
you finally catch something something

105
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,360
that you spent a lot of time looking for

106
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,680
and it kills your battery faster than

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,209
any game I've ever played before if I

108
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,769
could go on for a long time but I didn't

109
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,450
make this video to hate on pokemon gold

110
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,280
in fact I actually hope that the game

111
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,720
becomes more successful so that they can

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,130
put some money into it and then I can

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,299
finally play and who knows the game is

114
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,590
so popular and they're making so much

115
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,299
money that they're probably already

116
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,830
working on a second version that looks

117
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,209
like the commercials so for all of you

118
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,950
who haven't given a shot yet especially

119
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,959
if you're someone who loves Pokemon like

120
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,400
me don't have high expectations and it's

121
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,019
still a fun game I mean when you can

122
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,520
actually play it just don't expect it to

123
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,350
look like the commercials so one expect

124
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,300
it to be what we all wish for as kids

125
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,569
Pokemon in the real world because it's

126
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,979
not quite there yet in the

127
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,569
time that I was actually waiting for the

128
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,679
Pokemon goes servers to come back I

129
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:34,089
whipped something together that would

130
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:35,409
help you with that here's a more honest

131
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:36,939
commercial of what Pokemon dole is

132
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,319
really like in the form of the same show

133
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:40,089
that we all grew up with and loved

134
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,159
watching I mean except for the kids who

135
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:45,909
didn't even know that show existed fam

136
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:47,630
let savage know chill oh my god I'm not

137
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:57,459
