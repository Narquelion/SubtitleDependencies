00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
hey guys as you can see I'm back home in

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,589
boy and I was planning to pose a

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,299
different video today but being the

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,309
idiot that I am I forgot that video in

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,900
Vegas on a different computer so but

6
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,340
anyway every year come back home during

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,290
the holiday season I try to play at

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,519
least one nice thing for a random stream

9
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,929
whether it's paying for someone's meal

10
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,310
in a restaurant my buddy gets where a

11
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,900
homeless person or like punching a

12
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,449
crying baby on an airplane in the face

13
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,920
because I care about it nah just kidding

14
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,150
I don't have the homeless or pay for

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,560
meals so yesterday I thought it'd be fun

16
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,449
if I dressed up like Santa Claus and I

17
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,039
bought a bunch of toys and flowers and

18
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,449
burgers and just gave them all to random

19
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,890
people just to make their days been

20
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,930
except for the minor detail that I

21
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,610
didn't have a SATA suit so I just want

22
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,140
an enjoy one instead because I feel it

23
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,180
with all the negativity happening in the

24
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,469
world with you know the shootings and

25
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,239
you know just a bunch of people doing

26
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,800
crazy things because they thought the

27
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,480
world was in there I feel like people

28
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,219
are losing faith in humanity and one

29
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,079
random act of kindness could change the

30
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,190
mind of someone who was planning to kill

31
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,559
someone or planning to do something

32
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,510
really bad and also I just really wanted

33
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,860
to wear a ninja suit and walk around

34
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,860
town because I thought it'd be fun

35
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,030
chickens

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,120
but in all seriousness I didn't post

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,680
this video so you guys can be like oh my

38
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,230
God he's such a good person I'm really

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,640
not I punch babies on airplanes remember

40
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,410
I posted this video with the hopes that

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,120
it would inspire at least a few of you

42
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,070
to go and commit random acts of kindness

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,720

44
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,040
