1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
people always ask why did why tfn and I

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,130
think the catalyst to that was because

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:13,580
of that tour you ever make love to your

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,580
music no that would be super awkward

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:25,410
with the clapper claps right away

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:31,260
everybody okay welcome back to another

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:33,059
half the peel podcast today I thought it

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,980
was the I thought the audience come to

9
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:41,100
me just a kiss you are messing up today

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,170
so right before we got started there's

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,710
been a lot of technical difficulties on

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,710
the part of Paco but we are here with a

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,180
very special guest his name is jr. Akeno

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,180
this is when the applause was supposed

15
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,289
some of you might know who he is it was

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,630
thanks man sorry we've been having

17
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,310
really a lot of issues with getting this

18
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,560
thing started no we're good we're here

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,540
about an hour to get this thing started

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,400
but we're good and Jerry's here but

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,979
before we get started what is lucid

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,020
dreaming again lucid dreaming is

23
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,580
basically just you're aware that you're

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,259
dreaming so you can control it you can

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,549
literally do whatever you want like I've

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,439
never done it that's why I want to

27
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,530
actually see that it's not the other

28
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,600
thing no it wasn't the movie into your

29
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,100
thing of insidious insidious Oh what is

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,890
Inception no it's not it's not your

31
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,170
projections okay enough astral

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,189
projection is I think it's just it's

33
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,240
just seeing yourself sleep I don't know

34
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,740
what it's called just Autobody

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,090
experience and you kind of just see

36
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,729
yourself sleep okay

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,320
so I think I've done that before or or I

38
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,450
was dreaming that I was doing it

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,520
regardless it's very boring oh I know in

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,380
that dream or when if I was actually

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,939
doing it I was like I thought it was

42
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,770
lucid dreaming because I was awake while

43
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,790
it was happening but I was like okay I

44
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,200
want to fly through this roof and I

45
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,299
couldn't I was just like watching I was

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,520
on the ceiling stuck there looking at

47
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,320
myself sleep oh that's lame I know and

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,690
it wasn't scary this is before it's like

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,160
a livestream yeah and I'm just watching

50
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,170
myself sleep which is already kind of

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,950
weird but I'm aware of it I'm like oh

52
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,379
this must be loose

53
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,690
I thought like I felt my body lift up

54
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,819
and I could see myself sleep and it was

55
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,290
just so boring but then lucid dreaming

56
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:26,640
dreaming is when you can you're aware

57
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,720
whatever part of your dream you don't

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,830
even have to be like coming out of your

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,750
body or whatever it's like you're just

60
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,430
in the dream and you're aware like

61
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,980
there's certain triggers I guess that

62
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,810
you uh you can you can do like counting

63
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,250
how many fingers you have or looking at

64
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,459
watching your hand or something like

65
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,709
that

66
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,019
oh you have to trick you're not trick

67
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:44,099
yourself you have to UM need some kind

68
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,019
of way to tell yourself that you're

69
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,030
dreaming gotcha once you realize you're

70
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,170
dreaming you have complete control over

71
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,750
the world you can do whatever you want

72
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,579
you can fly you can have a celebrity

73
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,150
appear is kind of like Inception in

74
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:59,370
a way then I guess so I'm not I kind of

75
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,769
forget how inception worked well inside

76
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,750
is like it is controlling your dream but

77
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:09,030
to pick it uh yeah that to its inception

78
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,790
was the whole idea of like planting a

79
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,579
dream yeah right planting an idea inside

80
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,380
of somebody right

81
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:18,139
yeah lucid dreaming be tight I would

82
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,900
like I would actually probably just uh

83
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:23,730
be in a zombie apocalypse you would want

84
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,200
that to happen only because then I could

85
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,730
have my you know like you have your

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,130

87
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,459

16 yeah 16 I mean

148
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,070
from Anchorage Alaska being a small

149
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,420
place and this is before the internet -

150
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,070
so it's like oh I really don't know

151
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,270
anything outside of before I was popping

152
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,590
yeah yeah and I yeah I made it to the

153
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,240
top 44 and I was I got a hundred

154
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,800
thousand people sold out at that I was

155
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,720
like okay this actually could be a thing

156
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,510
so I went through high school and then

157
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,920
it was it was like the first semester of

158
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:02,040
college and I was on that's this this

159
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:05,490
new site called YouTube and I saw a

160
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:08,400
video by david choi friend of the show

161
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,840
right yep yes I saw the him playing the

162
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,450
YouTube song yeah he's playing was

163
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,050
featured yes all iPhone exactly yeah and

164
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,640
then I was like oh this looks cool looks

165
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,960
fun like and back then we're not

166
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,850
thinking anything of it we're just like

167
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:27,000
just gonna throw a video up and I and I

168
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:30,540
was like oh cool and then so I put up a

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,850
video and like I don't even look at it

170
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,950
if it was out of sync it was so bad no

171
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,390
this story yeah I told him I told him

172
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,310
like several times I think a lot of

173
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:43,190
people would not necessarily inspire

174
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:47,130
bird like a at Asian dude that

175
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,390
relatability yeah and yeah I just put up

176
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,800
a video and then didn't look at it for

177
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,810
it and then two weeks later looked at it

178
00:07:49,800 --> 00:08:10,290
again it was like 10 comments and 150

179
00:07:51,810 --> 00:08:13,080
views and we're talking about how

180
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,320
Alaska's I mean it's so far that a lot

181
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,090
of people consider it like another yeah

182
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,130
yeah same way to Hawaii a lot of times I

183
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,770
mean I don't correct them Hawaii's

184
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,780
another country that they say like how's

185
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,150
it like moving to the states I was like

186
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,770
yeah we are us yeah I don't correct them

187
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,480
but I just go with or whenever they're

188
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,710
visiting that Hawaii and they're like oh

189
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:38,460
I got to go back to the States

190
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:39,870
yeah I'm like you see me now Alaska is a

191
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,790
very I mean Hawaii is very different

192
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,250
last is very different - yeah we're both

193
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,180
different yeah yeah for sure well it's

194
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,460
crazy because some people

195
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,839
don't even know where Alaska is because

196
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,839
they cuz you know in some of the maps

197
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,089
Hawaii and Alaska like some people

198
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,820
really think yeah like I'm all y'all

199
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:01,410
they're like wait unless you know damn I

200
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,589
wish it was right next to each other you

201
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,810
know find the ones we bomb or it'd be so

202
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:09,209
worse for us you know you never would

203
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,070
have moved then then you're right anyway

204
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:13,470
Alaska is so different that they have

205
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,540
like I don't even know how many shows

206
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,700
but I only know that cuz my mom watches

207
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,529
it religiously and she's addicted to

208
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,899
them I mean it's it looks beautiful but

209
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:24,300
I mean it's not Anchorage they're like

210
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,529
in the middle of nowhere quickly did you

211
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,290
just imply that Anchorage isn't

212
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,000
beautiful no I mean nice is it no it's

213
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,589
wonderful it's a beautiful point where

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,120
the show where the shows took place is

215
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:35,339
not in like the city they make it seem

216
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,170
like it's in the middle of like the

217
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:40,140
woods oh it is in the middle I think

218
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,050
yeah cuz like literally there's only I

219
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,480
think 500,000 people like half a million

220
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:49,070
people in the whole state and just to

221
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,480
give you like like comparison like um

222
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:54,330
Alaska is two times it's like two to

223
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,040
three times bigger than Texas 2 to 3

224
00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:01,200
yeah I mean huge it is but then that's

225
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,430
not a lot of people that's not like you

226
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,170
how well you said Anchorage is like

227
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,570
encourage is about like I'll probably

228
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,990
say like 300,000 people it's still more

229
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:14,400

just punched him in the stomach like

256
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,110
really hard and it was actually really

257
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,790
my timing was really good because we

258
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,040
were all leaving the class to go outside

259
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,570
I punched really hard right before we

260
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:39,019
got out so no one was looking like it

261
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,019
was already out he was just like crying

262
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,490
and what happened trouble no no he was

263
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:54,649
using G yo shout out shout out to the

264
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,649
homie I'm not gonna put your name down

265
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:58,560
yeah similar story oh yeah I think I

266
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,910
already sat in the park can I sit on

267
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,380
this party said it in your book I don't

268
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,230
know about yeah well you just beaten up

269
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,399
people no I mean it's uh so I was in

270
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,529
kindergarten okay right

271
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:12,089
this is my scrap this is my I actually

272
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:14,040
have to use the misogynist yes I was

273
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,750
thinking and you know you like everybody

274
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,220
lines up for you know to go to like the

275
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,720
lunch or whatever I don't we used to do

276
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,670
that we would line up and it was always

277
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,440
like the goal to make it to the front of

278
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,180
the line okay where I sat and you can't

279
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,209
run cuz the teacher you just everybody

280
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,560
walks really fast like that but like you

281
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,870
know how kids when they're trying to try

282
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,250
to not run that was me but I could never

283
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,839
get there I could never get to the front

284
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,130
because where I was sitting I was like

285
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,779
towards the back of the class I have to

286
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,610
go around desks so the people on the

287
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,930
other side their backs facing the door

288
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,260
they turn around and they're already

289
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,480
there but this one time I remember I got

290
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,449
to the very front very frontal line

291
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,770
hyped I'm the reason why I remembered

292
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:51,899
this is cuz it was a big deal back then

293
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:54,930
I finally got to the front of line and

294
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:57,000
this girl cut in front of me she did us

295
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,190
she'd literally just saw me there did a

296
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,269
side step and came in front of me and I

297
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,980
didn't say anything

298
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,959
tuchus I stood before her turn around

299
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,310
and sock during her stomach and she just

300
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,050
collapsed and once she did one of those

301
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,310
like where she was on the ground

302
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,240
couldn't breathe and then I got sent to

303
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:15,050
the principal's office

304
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:20,449
yeah it was a girl some of my stories

305
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:22,759
were say just less use she cut dude no

306
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:24,709
what did yo that's that's not going well

307
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,519
I didn't know what if she liked you

308
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:29,420
though maybe play she was flirting

309
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:35,660
that's not how you flirt with

310
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:37,639
kindergarten Ryan like you know do you

311
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,759
like do you know this girl I remember

312
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,660
her I have it I did not on like a video

313
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:46,430
I was like sorry Hannah

314
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,170
well I mean I think it's like I was in

315
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,810
kindergarten yes so much trouble for

316
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,480
that already have you so mad you know I

317
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:57,290
was I was a I was a that was a jerk move

318
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,819
but she shouldn't have cut anyway that

319
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,589
wasn't a proper response didn't

320
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:02,689
understand the time don't mind that I

321
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:06,410
got yota for my parents - I feel you

322
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:08,300
yeah and then the second time I ever got

323
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,800
into a kind of a fight was in fourth or

324
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,220
fifth grade it was an after-school

325
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,230
program and I brought for like a show

326
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,269
and I brought a B and it was in like a

327
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,410
jar oh my god thing and it has like you

328
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:20,600
know obviously as whole dozen stuff with

329
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,949
it so I caught a B I thought was the

330
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,360
coolest thing I brought it took it to

331
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:25,670
the after-school program and this kid

332
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,500
tried to take it he tried to take my B

333
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,639
so he called John like he was like just

334
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,990
I guess he was just looking at it but he

335
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,149
took it with him out of my cubby hole

336
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,439
and he had it with him and I caught him

337
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:35,449
I was like what are you doing I took it

338
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,949
back put it in my cubby hole and the

339
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:38,540
heat we kind of got into like a scuffle

340
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:40,850
I don't know he was just like trying to

341
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,319
see it and this is like for the fifth

342
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,060
graders I did like four years of Judo

343
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:45,649
already so I just grabbed he's just

344
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,500
waiting for this moment and I tossed him

345
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:49,670
on his head yeah but I mean this is just

346
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
natural reaction like we were having

347
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,089
like a little little wrestling thing

348
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,689
going on it's what you were trained for

349
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:57,139
for years

350
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:59,329
yeah it was natural I can wait for the I

351
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:02,660
just it don't take my B and don't cut

352
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:05,410
that's the key did the B go unscathed

353
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,370
the B was fine it was good yeah but I um

354
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,550
might've been a wasp actually I don't

355
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,689
know oh wow I don't I don't remember um

356
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:16,129
but yeah I got in trouble for that too

357
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:17,839
so more no no I haven't yeah those two

358
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:19,730
times but both times it was a

359
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,490
reactionary response I wasn't pushing

360
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,529

362
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:29,269

00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,010
thing is it's almost like it's almost

375
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,930
like a respect it's not always like yeah

376
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,910
yeah yes are like okay we have problems

377
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,610
that's fine you guys like if we're not

378
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,820
gonna pull a gun stab each other go talk

379
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,320
either we yeah we yeah this talk it's

380
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,450
almost like a kind of like a normal

381
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,880
thing and then after you guys most times

382
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,579
like it's more um no matter who wins

383
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,779
you're supposed to shake hands yeah and

384
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:18,709
call it yeah like there shouldn't be

385
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,480
nothing else after that

386
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,769
yeah and that and it works that's that's

387
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,240
good though it's better than like you

388
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,920
know someone pulling out a knife and

389
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,050
stabbing someone or and then that person

390
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,240
retaliates know that with their family

391
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,070
and it kind of works I mean it's not

392
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,880
most civilized thing but it's about

393
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,649
respect and I liked it yeah and that's

394
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,000
why youtubers are boxing now they're

395
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,190
trying to respect each other you know

396
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,589
what's funny but they get the bag for it

397
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,240
those that is true you know what's funny

398
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,190
though before that became a real big

399
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,570
thing I always said like man these guys

400
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,680
are at the time they were just doing

401
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,750
dish trash sounds like they should just

402
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,850
like they really hate her that much just

403
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,010
flight display I didn't say bah I mean

404
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,180
before there was an ounce I was like I

405
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,769
mean I talked about this I don't want to

406
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,690
do a show if I was like you guys should

407
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:00,800
just fight and then make up like just

408
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,899
that's the best way to do it like you're

409
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,850
Hawaii style just just fight it out and

410
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,890
then you know who has no matter who wins

411
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,449
you just hug and then that's it call it

412
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:12,589
that my super funny that's all

413
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:15,339
presidents and dictators instead of wars

414
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:24,100
yeah we just

415
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:29,360
we'd be electing it on a different I

416
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:33,440
Donald Trump versus Kim also Kim what

417
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,540
car - I mean he's way younger yeah like

418
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,860
in a fight you had a fight fight oh he

419
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,630
does have like he has like

420
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,930
what is it when you're around his little

421
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,000
teaser god he's small but he's also way

422
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,860
younger than Donald Trump Oh God Trump

423
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,380
from what I hear it's very unhealthy

424
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,060
yeah I can't imagine he has any car do

425
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,980
something about his hair makes me feel

426
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,330
like he he can scrap like you know he

427
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,460
can't fight yeah I don't think so either

428
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,750
I think he's holding on like you see his

429
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,370
hair like he doesn't have you should

430
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,370
just get like he's fighting for his hair

431
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,330
he's so orange to everyone there was

432
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,240

claymation just way too we're way too um

436
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,210

that no no yeah just like you do damn

438
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,160

to this and I mean if we're talking

440
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,130
about YouTube in something like

441
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,710
comparisons from the past all now yeah

442
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:32,510
YouTube is great and thank you YouTube

444
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,480
guys were in this group called ytf which

445
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,450
was like probably one of the first if

446
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:46,700
not the first super group on YouTube

447
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:48,410
well super take that why is it super

448
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,390
well we were one of the mean before this

449
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,770
is before like all the team tens and

450
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,300
like the there was austere because there

451
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,700
are things right now right yeah we were

452
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,050
so we didn't they but they became

453
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,550
businesses like they treated it like

454
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,410
you're literally just friend you just

455
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,970
we're friends and then eventually we

456
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,040
made a business out of it in a way kinda

457
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,770
yeah but we were just friends who were

458
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,270
hanging out and we think it was that

459
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,860
wanted to do more stuff to hang no yeah

460
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,610
it was an excuse for us to hang out we

461
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,180
were just friends

462
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:18,440
and we came out with this thing whitey

463
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:20,270
AF yesterday today forever and we had a

464
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,530
message to spread and we basically just

465
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,110
made it because we wanted to hang out

466
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:29,450
want to tour together and yeah we

467
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:31,220
weren't we yeah we should like hiding in

468
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,020
videos and bullet yesterday today

469
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,970
forever that's the name that a lot of

470
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,400
you would knew yeah but I guess a more

471
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,690
subtle name that it was which was what

472
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,430
did you guys call we could talk about

473
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,380
that I mean I don't think it matters I

474
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,210
want to know cuz then the way that it

475
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,560
sounded the original name which is I

476
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,610
want you guys to say cuz I don't know

477
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,610
we're just gonna keep it a secret

478
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:55,169
No so originally originally before when

479
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,299
it was just us talking

480
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:58,919
it was literally a bunch of guys in a

481
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,989
room right and we were just hanging out

482
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,090
and we were like - we're like well this

483
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:05,580
is like a YouTube fret and that's what

484
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,409
how it started YF initially started that

485
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,909
way and they started talking about

486
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:10,679
getting all these letterman jackets and

487
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:12,869
it was like I was the one thing I was

488
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,070
opposed I know you guys wanted a but I

489
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:16,409
didn't want to let him in check it

490
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,070
anyway you know oh wow this kind of

491
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:19,169
popped in my head

492
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,450
what it's kind of misogynistic that you

493
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:23,669
wanted YouTube fret we didn't know what

494
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:27,869
I didn't did you choose for you to fret

495
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:35,369
the name because like you know punching

496
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:36,809
girls when he was actually I came up

497
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:38,129
with the alternative to white

498
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:39,869
because I thought it wasn't gonna

499
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:42,119
exclude girls from what is she a part of

500
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:43,559
this you wanted people to have run the

501
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,570
ytf mystery egg but it was just like

502
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,879
well at the time anymore

503
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,600
we had more girl followers and guys know

504
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,369
it's the opposite

505
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,340
oh really um yeah YouTube in general is

506
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:55,440
just more than okay um but yeah we

507
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,659
switched it to you know yesterday today

508
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,679
forever which essentially it was just

509
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:00,840
the message that we were trying to get

510
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,429
across right is yesterday is in the past

511
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,200
today you have a choice forever is up to

512
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,190
you same thing is it's kind of the last

513
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,009
two things they're kind of saying the

514
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,600
same thing but essentially just meaning

515
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:11,789
like the message one to spread was what

516
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,200
we believed in is is just making a

517
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:15,090
choice to do something yeah

518
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,259
despite your past you know whatever

519
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,059
happened don't let your past

520
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:22,139
circumstances yeah just do it

521
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:23,879
that's basically the Nike it's our own

522
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:26,879
thing who's that it was the same same

523
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:28,619
idea but in our in our way that's how II

524
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:32,190
doesn't we told it and then that's what

525
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,989
it became and from there I I guess you

526
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,039
guys went on to do a lot of pretty cool

527
00:21:33,989 --> 00:21:36,869
things Oh

528
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,710

562
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:20,789
just gut feeling yep had a gut feeling

563
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:22,679
oh but then for most part I'm like just

564
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:25,009
worried about her well-being cuz I know

565
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,789
she was going now she's drink above abla

566
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:29,489

567
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:33,989
woke up that morning got on the phone

568
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:36,389
with her found out that she and then we

569
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:38,099
had to do that photo shoot I kind of

570
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:39,839
briefly yeah you remember and then I

571
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:41,279
kind of went downstairs in the lobby and

572
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,479
Nelson house up to everybody and then I

573
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,519
just couldn't hold it in so I went back

574
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:46,949
upstairs and I started like laughing

575
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:48,869
hysterically laughing like crying and

576
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:52,109
like I was like I just like was like

577
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:54,199
shocked I can't believe this and then

578
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:56,969
went back down and we did a photo shoot

579
00:23:54,199 --> 00:24:01,169
okay well I don't remember that okay so

580
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:03,569
Hawaii wasn't that fun no no that was

581
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:04,079
for sure that was my best time well it

582
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:06,029
was fun

583
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,430
just wait why despite that yeah oh that

584
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:12,180
is why I am that is why I

585
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:14,010
on stage during uh I forgot one of the

586
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,170
songs that I did save this I had a song

587
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,850
called see this yeah and I choked up

588
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,670
during during the performance and a

589
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,740
project man this song is so deep yeah it

590
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:25,050
was really that moment Wow cuz I

591
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,300
remember writing that song not about a

592
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,550
specific person but then after the

593
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:33,000
moment after applied it applied and I

594
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:34,980
was like damn that correct okay so when

595
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,020
you do write songs it's not always

596
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,809
necessarily there is it's always

597
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,270
inspired by love obviously so a lot of a

598
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:44,520
lot of it is just different aspects but

599
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:47,580
sometimes it'll be personal and then

600
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,250
other times it'll be I'll know enough

601
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,960
from someone's perspective to write on

602
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,850
it or it intrigues me enough where I'll

603
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,010
be able to be like how would I how would

604
00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:00,410
I react in this situation or right

605
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:02,220
that's interesting yeah yeah but go away

606
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,900
well I guess that would make sense

607
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,700
though I mean I think some of the best

608
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,350
music for whatever reason maybe it's

609
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,630
just my personality like I really like

610
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,860
really sad Oh tragedy alright great

611
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,870
heart horrible music don't tell them

612
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:18,540
just like just hurt me it's like damn

613
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:20,340
yeah I'm just like no but then you get

614
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,850
inspiration yeah you get it I'm like

615
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,080
that too

616
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,550
you just on a writing drought it's just

617
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,320
like I need to get I need to get my

618
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:30,210
heart broken just dating people just so

619
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,350
he can make good meal yo Taylor Swift

620
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,679
does that I think yeah that's what I

621
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,500
think too

622
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,320
Taylor Swift it loses its allure Swift

623
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,030
conspiracies she dates people only to

624
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,260
get her heart broken so that she can

625
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,390
write good music Wow

to a hotel or something for like two

656
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,610

658
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:10,480
meeting greet it be like almost midnight

659
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,120
if there was an event we have to go to

660
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,529
the event after and the flight was like

661
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,049
a few hours after that so there was no

662
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:18,789
hotel really it was just like that for

663
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:24,100
like two weeks straight that's everybody

664
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:26,140
was mad and grouchy every everyone was

665
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,380
and that was that was the last tour we

666
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,120
did I was thinking I don't want to ever

667
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,950
do a tour again not just with you know

668
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,980
why Jeff just in general I was just like

669
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,260
after that experience is that I wouldn't

670
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,240
say that's when ytf ended but it was it

671
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,309
was a catalyst I think yeah I had to

672
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,559
hurt I feel that yeah I like the jackets

673
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:46,360
though she was like to try like all the

674
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,770
judges jackets were so expense I never

675
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,970
wore it except for all the black and

676
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:58,029
Golden's were a little bit better all

677
00:27:48,970 --> 00:28:00,130
the black those red ones though imagine

678
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:09,970
if we got all of them together and sold

679
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:11,740
it as a package five bucks for those who

680
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,240

who's doing well but we just don't know

697
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:56,649

not that we didn't allow girls in it was

706
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,719
just at the time when we formed it

707
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,179
that's what who was around it's very

708
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:25,089
casual this guy's all right I want to

709
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:27,849
ask one what was like one of the

710
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:30,849
craziest ytf stories you've never told

711
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:32,739
but you feel like you know it's been a

712
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:35,409
while it's been a while I think I can

713
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:37,029
let another we haven't told any real

714
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:38,679
stories but we never talked about

715
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:41,469
anything really

716
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,599
or individually or as a group you see

717
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:46,119
why TF story yeah like was there ever

718
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:48,190
like one night where just like 70

719
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:50,979
strippers came into like a hotel room

720
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:56,889

did anything crazy what well we're lame

725
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:08,409
honestly the most that we ever did was

726
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:10,149
when they when everyone lived in North

727
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:12,539

00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:14,709
hung out I just yeah we're in the rooms

729
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:17,619
playing video games or watching movies

730
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:19,539

731
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:21,699
nice little pirate bread boy you go to

732
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:25,690
Panera Bread down the street that looks

733
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:27,159
like our exciting day like hey don't eat

734
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,819
the Greek food like that one spot oh

735
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,679
yeah

736
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:34,419
yo yo we're lame down no.not I hear it

737
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,459
back it what's kinda lame we didn't do

738
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:38,049
what our tours I mean I think most the

739
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,309
time we were literally just doing video

740
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,379
like we really were just having fun

741
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:43,269
making videos yeah this literally like

742
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:45,729
it's like how could for the most part

743
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:47,440
we're literally just doing how what can

744
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:48,010
we do to be creative and help each other

745
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,860
to make

746
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:52,360
videos make whatever idea come true and

747
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,340
a lot of stuff we didn't even put on

748
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,780
camera like a lot of freestyle stuff do

749
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,420
like we'd start we'd make each other

750
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:02,260
laugh so hard too much to date yet too

751
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,880
much laughing we had to stop it no I do

752
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:07,090
think though why cuz people always ask

753
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,720
why did why tfn and I think the catalyst

754
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:12,910
to that was because of that tour and at

755
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,280
the same time that's when keV he's

756
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,930
booked that Cartoon Network thing he was

757
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,610
on like doing some Cartoon Network not a

758
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,470
show but he was like hosting or to

759
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,090
network a little bit and so he wasn't on

760
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,090
that tour so already it became six

761
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,200
people from seven yeah and you know not

762
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,360
saying that it's because of cab that's

763
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,160
white anything bud but that is like I

764
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,510
think it's around that tour yeah it was

765
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,610
just too much it's a lot for one I just

766
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,470
didn't I was just a host like I didn't

767
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:39,880
like I think it I think I think it also

768
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:44,230
started when you when you start I think

769
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,790
it was the when you start bringing

770
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,260
business and friendship into each other

771
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,330
and not having the clear distinction

772
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,890
between the two we didn't start it as a

773
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,000
business yeah yeah there's no

774
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,890
infrastructure that were like a

775
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,220
communication exactly communication

776
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:59,290
number one for anything yeah

777
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:04,390
communication now people know weren't

778
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:07,930

779
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:09,580
seeing not talking all right well I mean

780
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,950

781
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,150

obligatory get back into the future

818
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:15,970
version and there's like oh we changed

819
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,970
some notes that's how things work

820
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,369
the main dialect is Tagalog there's

821
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:24,589
another one though right there's a

822
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:27,319
lock-on oh that's like a lot of rounds a

823
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:31,480
lot of ones I think and this is ion yeah

824
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:34,460
but yeah there's no there's like a lot

825
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,139
my dad speaks six times so but there's

826
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,319
like other one is hundreds really

827
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:40,579
thousands that's just words no but it's

828
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:44,059
like different regions they have

829
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:46,099
different it's almost like yeah it's

830
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:47,780
like let's say like even in um like in

831
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:49,970
America we have people from the Midwest

832
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:52,339
for most like acts those like slangs or

833
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:55,220
like it's almost like this it's like cuz

834
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:58,970
like in certain dialects they don't like

835
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:00,829
pronounce like certain letters and all

836
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,270
that stuff I see it's just stuff like

837
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:04,819
little things like that and then just

838
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:06,829
even words like in a hole in Pigeon we

839
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:11,569
don't pronounce ours at the end yeah

840
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:14,800
words like like mo yeah mo bettah which

841
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:22,390
is Obama are better mo Bamba

842
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:29,260
it's almost like yeah he's a big song

843
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:32,680
it's a song Bamba has his own song yeah

844
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:34,810
oh sorry you can't do that song we're

845
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,200

846
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,210
rookie

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,700
oh no second year I think that's really

848
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:43,390
that bill okay so I believe I ran across

849
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,310
a video where the guy was saying that he

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:48,100

times but this Twitter video had like

862
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:18,760
I'd say at least a hundred

863
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:21,220
oh I kid and it's all about the games no

864
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,620
in well games too but in a jumping like

865
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,520
a large trampoline gymnast area and

866
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,290
they're playing that and all these

867
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,140
little kids are like singing along with

868
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:33,360
the song and then wow yeah right is the

869
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,360
n-word just like they're all like oh

870
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,030
yeah like seeing like the basketball

871
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,070
games and you see like college like you

872
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:42,220
know college games get intense and they

873
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:45,730
are saying it and I'm like people can do

874
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:47,020
that I mean they're not supposed to what

875
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,150
you're looking and you'd be like I'll be

876
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,850
like damn these guys don't care one of

877
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,500
the college games the red isn't that

878
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,060
part was a bother to come up there's a

879
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,710
black guy filming that he filmed another

880
00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:06,610
black guy in the crowd and the black I

881
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:08,080
was like I always thought like yeah I

882
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:10,840
mean you just stay away from it in

883
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,820
general yeah but I mean I guess if it's

884
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,470
not in that context in a negative way

885
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,970
it's they're literally they're not st.

886
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,310
they're not creating the word they're

887
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,680
just repeating yeah like what is it like

888
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:23,020
ya know I mean I feel like like what if

889
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,560
you got a Kanye West we we are not for

890
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:27,970
we're for sure not the ones to decide

891
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,220
decide yes

892
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,930
but cuz like at the I just avoided yeah

893
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,300
yeah cuz that end of the day we don't

894
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:38,230
have the yeah it's not us affecting yeah

895
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:40,570
it's not our word yeah so like if if you

896
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:46,420
could avoid it just do it

897
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:48,550
uh-huh I think that's the thing I mean

898
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,590
every even I was even thought like even

899
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:53,470
black people not say it - because it's

900
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:55,660
like demeaning - especially then right

901
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,250
like I mean I I've seen both sides yeah

902
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,780
obviously where it's almost become a

903
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,730
part of the language but those there's

904
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,100
like between the black community are

905
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,840
already fight about that yeah X some

906
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,820
people say you shouldn't say it and then

907
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,550
I see because the argument is like that

908
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,470
the argument is that like they took that

909
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:13,210
word which was negative and creative

910
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,860
right right at their own which was like

911
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:17,110
a word of endearment amongst themselves

912
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,970
that's why other cultures feel like they

913
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:21,100
can say it because it's like oh this is

914
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,500
not a negative thing but it stems from

915
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,850
something like that

916
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,590
so I can see why people would sing yeah

917
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:29,370
but it's also and I think it's also

918
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:31,540
coupled with when people say without

919
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,670
education being educated about the world

920
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,170
and I think that's the main problem is

921
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,830
like why you don't even you don't

922
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,930
understand

923
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,300
yeah what comes with that you haven't

924
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,680
earned the right now and why don't we

925
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,450
never will you know what I mean cuz we

926
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,130
don't we don't have that we don't know

927
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,050
the history we don't know we don't know

928
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:51,090
what that actually means to be that it

929
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:53,980
also changes over time - yeah like like

930
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:58,540
even back in in especially in Hawaii for

931
00:38:53,980 --> 00:39:01,360
us like I said the fa G word on a video

932
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,810
and I was like I didn't think anything

933
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,180
of it

934
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:07,300
yeah it didn't have the same meaning

935
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:10,150
that it did now granted back then being

936
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,580
gay wasn't as popular I guess or X as

937
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,350
accepted but I didn't associate that

938
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,850
with gay people I just thought like oh

939
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,170
that meant something else like it's like

940
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,910
oh if you're feminine if you're acting

941
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,700
feminine I thought that's what I thought

942
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,410
that's what it was I didn't know you

943
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,270
didn't know that the word itself had a

944
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:28,240
negative had I known what I know now

945
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:30,070
back then of course no better yeah but

946
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,990
it's just how in over time and back then

947
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,760
- people didn't think much of it yeah

948
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:36,520
either like gay people didn't think much

949
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,350
no so for me because I'm from Hoya as

950
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,060
well and then like there are people who

951
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,920
are called ma who's which are kind of

952
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,630
like it's kind of like um

953
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,430
offensive isn't it no supposedly it

954
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:47,230
isn't least in the comments that from

955
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,150
the other one but it's kind of like a

956
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:52,059
Hawaiian word for that in a way but not

957
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:55,809
as offensive and I used to get called

958
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:58,000
the f-word by them so I was like hmm

959
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:59,710
what is his word now so I didn't even

960
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,450
think it was like associated so much

961
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,950
like game stuff I just thought it was

962
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:07,630
like an insult I was like damn dude they

963
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:09,010
got me they're gonna call me that and I

964
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:12,220
guess it's not that bad but they got me

965
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:14,349
yeah so it's just it's weird how it um

966
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,569
things just change everything maybe

967
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:18,190
there's a word we said today that when

968
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:33,760

969
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:35,109

970
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,170

welcome to using beef the first question

993
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:57,140
we have we

994
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:59,150
a couple okay Kyra Arata

995
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,809
what's one important lesson or thing

996
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,880
Ryan learned from junior and vice versa

997
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:06,019
one important so yes it something that

998
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,549
you guys have learned from each other

999
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:10,819
that you feel like you can really credit

1000
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:14,809
the other person oh for sure go ahead

1001
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:17,719
my thing with Ryan it's it's literally

1002
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:20,569
anything you put your mind to you can

1003
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:20,779
you can accomplish that's what I taught

1004
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:23,150
you

1005
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:26,450
yeah I know I think it's not necessarily

1006
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:28,160
teaching but you taught by example but

1007
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,019
just doing stuff you have he embedded

1008
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,089
into you yeah you already had the

1009
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:34,640
mindset but yeah see someone do it yeah

1010
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:36,829
to see honor on a constant consistent

1011
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,079
level and you that's what I mean that's

1012
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:43,729
that whenever I think of people that

1013
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:45,650
have longevity and and someone that puts

1014
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:47,509
their mind to something cuz if people

1015
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,309
don't know if you were following Ryan

1016
00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:51,140
and you don't already know this anything

1017
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:54,049
Ryan wants to do he will end up doing

1018
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:57,200
and do it fairly well that's not

1019
00:42:54,049 --> 00:43:04,339
necessarily right whatever that's right

1020
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:07,160
games whatever you're not allowed to but

1021
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:10,400
yeah I think that I don't think that's

1022
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,390
the gotta be be in that one haha well I

1023
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,670
mean why don't I think what you're

1024
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,469
referring to because we have I mean you

1025
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,749
have mentioned this before and what the

1026
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:22,309
thing that you taught me for one is just

1027
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:24,920
a run is no just just in general about

1028
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:26,329
music it's so like literally I knew

1029
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,799
nothing like I don't know what a harmony

1030
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:28,579
I didn't know what harmony was you're

1031
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:29,959
the one who taught me that

1032
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:32,209
oh you if you go just like two notes

1033
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:34,039
above mmm the other note or was it two

1034
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,690
notes it's something like that I was not

1035
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:36,949
like that's what I would I would take

1036
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,449
all of that could I'm just like why does

1037
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:40,309
this sound a certain way and I never

1038
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,079
understood why things sound that way and

1039
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:42,979
then when I heard you and Andrew singing

1040
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,489
together you would explain to me that

1041
00:43:42,979 --> 00:43:45,499
it's just

1042
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:46,969
oh he sings this I sing this and it

1043
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:48,799
sounds like this yeah yeah and it's like

1044
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:50,749
two notes above harmonizes with the

1045
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:52,279
whatever you're singing yeah I learned

1046
00:43:50,749 --> 00:43:54,469
all this music stuff and I was so

1047
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:55,609
interested down to like what runs were

1048
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:56,630
obvious like how do you do that with

1049
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:58,519
your voice when you're just singing

1050
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:00,440
annoying it's like going up and down or

1051
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:03,170
whatever do you run I can't do it you're

1052
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,820
always doing Dom literally do the same

1053
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:08,270
now I haven't done it in so long

1054
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:10,490
um yeah I mean that's that's because

1055
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:13,160
we're doing it so much that it became

1056
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:15,410
easy to do who does fire huh in any way

1057
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,450
I like that what is the run that they do

1058
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:27,680
and then maybe he can I merely remember

1059
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:29,570
I don't remember either singer singer

1060
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,730
he's same sings he's trying to sing sing

1061
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:34,160
he sings sings yeah shout of TD jakes

1062
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:35,720
yeah get on the podcast well basically

1063
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,980
it just means because we were all around

1064
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,980
this goes back to why it's a freegan

1065
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,150
we're all around like dancers so people

1066
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,980

just like build time between the good

1076
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:08,810
stuff dances and stuff and sketches yeah

1077
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,910
but we weren't dancers or singers like

1078
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:12,410
you had talent in itself yeah no but I

1079
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:15,140
think what he's saying is that what he

1080
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:17,810
does isn't widely accepted as an art

1081
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:19,250
form exactly we could bring people to

1082
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,260
the seats but you guys were the

1083
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,870
entertainment we filled the time in

1084
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,670
between that our performance was

1085
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:27,290
literally just hey nice to meet you it's

1086
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:30,140
so great to meet you good to meet you at

1087
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:32,450
the end for the show but I think it

1088
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,000
speaks volumes to how how great you guys

1089
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:38,030
are at what you do because they

1090
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,880
literally wanted to see you guys too

1091
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,740
most but it's like I mean if you watch

1092
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,390
somebody a lot it was just a great it

1093
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:48,860
was a great time to just like get some

1094
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:54,320
fans and be like amen I sing oh wow

1095
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:56,360
a lot of people were shocked I think

1096
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,950
like a lot like there's a bunch of

1097
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,790
people obviously who heard I already

1098
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,230
knew who you guys were

1099
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,880
yeah but then there's some people who

1100
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,320
would come and be like holy crap this

1101
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,420
guy can sing like these guys are real

1102
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,980
this is not like YouTube performance

1103
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,810
this is like real performers yeah I mean

1104
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,310
you're youtubers but now they don't

1105
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,930
didn't know that you guys were like I

1106
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:14,060
don't really legit perform mean there's

1107
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:17,330
there's there is that um there is that

1108
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:18,050
mindset of or that perception of like

1109
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:20,660
what a

1110
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:22,430
youtuber is yeah and the the stand I

1111
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:24,500
mean I think across the board even with

1112
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:26,020
just like actors or whatever if you're

1113
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:31,340
on YouTube you're kind of seemed like

1114
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:32,750
below a mainstream yeah yeah and I mean

1115
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,060
to a certain degree especially back then

1116
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:37,010
it was justified I mean there was some

1117
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:40,190
shows shows I won't even call them shows

1118
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:41,600
yeah where it's just people it's

1119
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,610
basically just a meeting great yeah yeah

1120
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,600
but we there was a you guys were

1121
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:46,100
actually performing that's what you guys

1122
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,470
did for a living we tried to have

1123
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,820
production that I've tried we tried and

1124
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:52,700
even our show I think like we at least

1125
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:54,920
we tried saw effort yeah

1126
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,480
but anyway that's something I would say

1127
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,430
out the whole music thing which actually

1128
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,780
made a big impact on my career cuz I

1129
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,280
started doing like music videos and

1130
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,560
stuff one of the first ones we did

1131
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,080
together was I'm always horrors kill all

1132
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:08,900
the videos yeah hardcore was the first

1133
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,970
we did one with David and you

1134
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:17,270
I remember you we were filming that

1135
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:21,200
video and and and you were on a boat we

1136
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:22,340
need this footage like this was that one

1137
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,210
of the first things I do with David

1138
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:28,580
actually ever anyway next question we

1139
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:32,150
went we went you have another one see

1140
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:34,970
Loremaster 666 or Johnny X was a devil

1141
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:37,580
yeah asked was there a defining moment

1142
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:41,480
where you said this is it I want to

1143
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:43,310
become a singer Oh hmm cuz I'm sure

1144
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,750
during your career there there's

1145
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,220
actually been different levels of like

1146
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:48,320
this is what I want to do and it was

1147
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:50,120
like a grand idea and then now you're

1148
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,800
like Oh more specifically this is what I

1149
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,940
want to do you know whether YouTube

1150
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,410
being popped off you're like oh I want

1151
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:56,270
to do this and now when you found out

1152
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:58,310
cuz you talked a little bit off you're

1153
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:00,410
telling him when he wanted to be ya know

1154
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:02,750
I want to hear well might actually know

1155
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:04,460
the it actually happened before all the

1156
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:07,700
auditioning all that YouTube's dug it

1157
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:09,440
was I think I was 12 or 13 mmm and I saw

1158
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,530
this I saw the first season of American

1159
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,910
Idol and I was like Kelly Clarkson yeah

1160
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:15,320
Kelly Clarkson's season and I would

1161
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:17,630
literally wash it and I was like oh I

1162
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,650
want to do that and then I was just a

1163
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,660
matter of waiting yeah

1164
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:23,180
and I don't see I didn't teach you that

1165
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:25,280
you already did that before I may know

1166
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:27,890
what it was like but you know um but no

1167
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,869
cuz you know seeing it on a level other

1168
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,910
than just music and sign right right

1169
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:33,229
and a personal level I think that's yeah

1170
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:36,170
when you see someone that you admire and

1171
00:48:33,229 --> 00:48:38,749
respect so it's right yeah but for sure

1172
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:41,869
when I was like 12 or 13 and I saw that

1173
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:44,869
I was like oh man I want to do this and

1174
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:47,930
then I guess moving on then so at what

1175
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:49,219
point are you now where you're like this

1176
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:50,869
is the type of singer that you want to

1177
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,430
be you know there's like oh yeah yeah

1178
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:54,349
yeah like genre wise and all that stuff

1179
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:58,339
like what kind of music I want to like

1180
00:48:54,349 --> 00:49:00,200
write and all that yeah I think um I you

1181
00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:02,920
know I grew up on like R&B I listen to

1182
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:07,969
everything but I'm like majority is like

1183
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:10,279
R&B pop kind of thing so but I also just

1184
00:49:07,969 --> 00:49:12,349
love I just like I write from personal

1185
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:16,309
experience so it's a lot about love so

1186
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:20,569
um I think once I picked up like once I

1187
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:21,979
picked up a guitar I was like okay what

1188
00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:24,859

1189
00:49:21,979 --> 00:49:27,019
how to write about like things I don't

1190
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:28,849
know yeah so everything's pretty

1191
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:31,069
heartfelt I guess I that's kind of

1192
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:55,670

continue a little bit more on this yeah

1221
00:51:16,819 --> 00:51:21,890
go ahead I want to do a little deeper

1222
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:24,709
okay so you talked about this outside

1223
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:27,950
before okay how there was a moment about

1224
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:30,079
a year and a half ago yes where you

1225
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:33,910
realized and I think is because of a

1226
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:36,049
breakup yeah oh I I really needed to

1227
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:38,479
decide what I want to do with my life

1228
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:41,509
yeah I mean I'm more or less it was like

1229
00:51:38,479 --> 00:51:43,519
um it's not necessarily what I wanted to

1230
00:51:41,509 --> 00:51:46,190
do with my life but knowing what I need

1231
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:49,729
to do and assessing like my life at the

1232
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:51,410
moment was like oh I mean yeah falling

1233
00:51:49,729 --> 00:51:53,180
off you have a hiatus like you know you

1234
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:54,529
did not do anything and you're in this

1235
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:57,109
position in your career right now

1236
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:58,999
because you have not done the things

1237
00:51:57,109 --> 00:52:01,759
that necessary to keep it going hmm

1238
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:04,099
and at that moment I was like okay you

1239
00:52:01,759 --> 00:52:06,229
know after the breakup okay I'm I after

1240
00:52:04,099 --> 00:52:07,519
a long after a long relationship is like

1241
00:52:06,229 --> 00:52:09,380
five and a half years you know you kind

1242
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,630
of become codependent at a point right

1243
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:14,660
um so after the breakup I was like okay

1244
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:16,609
I don't know how to function by myself

1245
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:20,180
but then I was like I can either just

1246
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:21,499
quit I remember there was a part of me

1247
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,789
was like oh my god

1248
00:52:21,499 --> 00:52:24,739
till last night I actually thought about

1249
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:29,089
it for a little bit yeah for like a good

1250
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:31,940
week and I was like no no so um that was

1251
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:33,769
the moment I was okay I could either do

1252
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,690
that or I can be here and just start

1253
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:38,569
creating and start making music again

1254
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:40,009
mm-hmm and from that moment on I haven't

1255
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:42,469
looked back and it's been great so

1256
00:52:40,009 --> 00:52:44,029
you're like I just saw recently you post

1257
00:52:42,469 --> 00:52:45,259
about how you have like I forget what

1258
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:49,430
number it was but like over a million

1259
00:52:45,259 --> 00:52:51,140
Spotify was it plays or oh no yeah a

1260
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:53,030
year like yeah because they always do

1261
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,920
like a year wrap-up thing I think like

1262
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,990
well it's crazy cuz I'm Spotify

1263
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,780
specifically it was like when I first

1264
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:01,520
started that first year I think I maybe

1265
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:03,470
only had 40,000 I had the stupid thing

1266
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,510
where I didn't upload my music like it

1267
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:09,349
literally has not been on Spotify or

1268
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:10,400
anything for the past 10 years Wow yeah

1269
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:12,319
I was late

1270
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:17,720
you're dumb I missed all that bag I'm

1271
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:18,790
biased Joe all the bags but whatever you

1272
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:28,579
can't

1273
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:30,200
yesterday today the other day but yeah

1274
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:31,880
it was uh yeah I remember when I first

1275
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:35,630
started the first year it's it's tripled

1276
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,910
since the since the urine Avco right um

1277
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:39,920
so it's been good I mean yeah and I

1278
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:41,329
actually just recently put out an EP too

1279
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,390
so if y'all want to check out shameless

1280
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:46,280
plug got out we started I was gonna ask

1281
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:48,410
you about that actually that's the way

1282
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,359
so and not just that EP in general cause

1283
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:51,619
it would name the EP it's your last the

1284
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:54,050
fifth song on that there's five songs

1285
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:55,730
what we started what we started named it

1286
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:58,730
that I really like the one right before

1287
00:53:55,730 --> 00:54:02,660
the the fourth one was the fourth one I

1288
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:03,170
think that was either I think a Great

1289
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,119
Escape

1290
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:07,339
no this is there that I think it's great

1291
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,980
escape it sounds more familiar ah

1292
00:54:07,339 --> 00:54:11,480
well regardless you're not sexy I like

1293
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,770
that whatever the fourth one was I

1294
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,660
remember being like oh this is all great

1295
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:16,069
escape yeah then what we started and

1296
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:17,270
then that's the name of your album and I

1297
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:19,790
always wondered like why don't they just

1298
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:21,319
put the best song name the best song

1299
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,550
after the album and put it first so

1300
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:25,010
everybody knows like oh this is the one

1301
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:27,290
everybody knows and now and I always

1302
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,940
wondering like how do you decide on what

1303
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,619
the name yes and what's the name the

1304
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,390
album is for one and then why do you put

1305
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:33,800
it last I guess last makes more sense

1306
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:36,650
but sometimes it's like in the middle of

1307
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:40,520
the album um well I can't well I mean

1308
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:41,869
for me specifically what we started

1309
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,260
actually what we started was I wrote

1310
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:47,329
that like five years ago a long time

1311
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,770
shout out to Jessie Barrera and Jay bird

1312
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:53,300
they helped me put this project together

1313
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:55,849
and as far as like picking this the name

1314
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:58,130
of the project I was just like if I felt

1315
00:54:55,849 --> 00:55:00,680
fitting what we started just seemed like

1316
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:03,170
something that spoke to me where I was

1317
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:05,599
like you know what where where I've been

1318
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:06,680
going where I came from and where I'm

1319
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,360
going to go and I

1320
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,180
wanted to pay homage to that so what we

1321
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:15,590
started kind of felt like that also this

1322
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:18,650
project is kind of like a bunch of my

1323
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:20,450
influences in one thing so like design

1324
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:22,610
like the first opening track is like

1325
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:24,980
it's very different from yeah it's very

1326
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:27,410
it but it's also very like JT like

1327
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,700
Justin Timberlake and sing very pop so

1328
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:30,470
that's something I love the group on

1329
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:33,080
that but then you also have Great Escape

1330
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:35,480
which is very kind of like Latin R&B and

1331
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,460
I also that reminds me of like early

1332
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,440
2000s R&B which is like um there's an

1333
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,330
usher song that called how do I say that

1334
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,510
super inspired that and then you have

1335
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:47,270
what we started the title track which is

1336
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:50,690
kind of kind of like a Drake feel the

1337
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:53,240
way the beat the beat is um but yeah

1338
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,950
that's how I that's that's why I chose

1339
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,290
that as the title but as far as the

1340
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:58,850
order um kind of just seeing how the

1341
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:01,400
flow was oh it's really just a flow

1342
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:03,140
crazy yeah I always wondered that

1343
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,330
because a lot of times like every artist

1344
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,710
they like name their album something and

1345
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:08,450
it's not necessarily the one that's the

1346
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:10,130
hit yeah yeah you know sometimes they

1347
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:12,620
even name it and it's not even a song

1348
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:14,450
yeah exactly yeah yeah for me yeah I

1349
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,140
just did it as a flow thing cuz my thing

1350
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,610
I was like okay

1351
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,320
how do I want to capture someone's a

1352
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:19,610
year I got it and then I put design in

1353
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,580
the front cuz like once that beat hit

1354
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:26,450
you're like okay alright well going get

1355
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:28,130
what do you follow on Spotify oh you can

1356
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:30,050
you can add my song to a playlist you

1357
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:32,960
can follow that's better something yeah

1358
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:34,370
add it on to a playlist yeah and or buy

1359
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,300
it on iTunes I'm sure there anything

1360
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:39,590
it's on all all streaming al digital

1361
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,230
platform there you go if you haven't

1362
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:44,780
heard jr. before he is one of the best

1363
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:47,270
vocalists that I know personally no but

1364
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:48,620
I mean Ryan I won't say that you you

1365
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,480
guys haven't hung out in like a long

1366
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:52,010
time like a couple of years or so and

1367
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,360
then the one night you came back and

1368
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:55,580
we're all just chilling and then you

1369
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,850
left after Ryan was like damn I missed

1370
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:00,620
Jr's voice I sang for like a little bit

1371
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:03,110
I was like damn I used to get this all

1372
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:04,820
the time used to hang out all the other

1373
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:06,680
place and I would hear him sing I took

1374
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:12,680
it for granted dude as I did took you

1375
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:15,080
for granted singers and stuff like you

1376
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,670
like get so used to it and just like oh

1377
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,720
when you doing here for a long time when

1378
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,940
here at live it's like wow this sounds

1379
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,660
like a track hmm so like I mean I think

1380
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,010
if you haven't her

1381
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,450
jay-ar before go check him out it you

1382
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:24,589
would not I guess you kind of just heard

1383
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:28,520
him singing this you should predicts it

1384
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:30,319
do not base that the perfect

1385
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,970
representation here are singing yes I

1386
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:35,809
want to know this real quick though yeah

1387
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:37,250
you ever make love to your own music no

1388
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:42,470
that would be super awkward

1389
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:44,450
what yeah okay okay get it but but

1390
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:45,619
that's okay let's say a like you get in

1391
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,329
the mood y'all yes

1392
00:57:45,619 --> 00:57:49,940
the moves getting set and then out of

1393
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:52,940
nowhere you just say hi like no and it's

1394
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:56,180
not coming from me that would be crazy

1395
00:57:52,940 --> 00:58:02,920
actually be more crazy or crazier you

1396
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:07,869
actually singing Kanye does that

1397
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,869
wouldn't be surprised yeah he's like a

1398
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:14,630
service that knew banging Mia and they

1399
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:17,480

1400
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:20,420
like him do you like it she's like I

1401
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:21,859
guess now no you know who's wild I bet

00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,430
you you know it does could get away with

1403
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:24,430
it Chris Brown

1404
00:58:25,089 --> 00:58:32,029
like I could see him doing like and then

1405
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:40,039
he like starts krumping like before he

1406
00:58:32,029 --> 00:58:41,960
get started yeah yeah I already talked

00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,980
could what how about they do that they

1414
00:59:08,029 --> 00:59:11,599
making YouTube uncut and they'd start

1415
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:14,569
paying for that premium that would be

1416
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:17,440
cool they're a very welcome a target

1417
00:59:14,569 --> 00:59:22,369
targeted playlist of just very

1418
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,809
disturbing video no it was there was
