colored trees seasons are changing we

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,800
take your dares put them in a hat and if

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,240
we draw at the player's heart so then

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,830
decides how many points is worth based

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,029
on holidaying of a dare it is if the

14
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,590
player passes another player can take

15
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,970
the steal the first player to get ten

16
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,349

Hall of Fame no just kidding they get

19
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,190

21
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:43,559
JJ you may have seen them before maybe

22
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,489

26
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,280
time that somebody's ever requested to

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:18,150
do a night air you nobody wants to do an

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:19,680
idea you actually reached so now we get

29
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,570
everybody to send the foil ball because

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,890

31
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:30,119

all right the other half to the spirits

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,270

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,720

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:20,910
your foot as you can do that depends if

39
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:22,410
he draws blood I guess we could decide

40
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:45,420
how much points after we see in the

41
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:48,870
object in the head so we're basically

42
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,120
offering JJ to up his points to three

43
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,370
points but sila gets a slap is put with

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,549

anything all right

186
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:50,029
I dare you in a soccer kick a rock all

187
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,470
right so we changed it because instead

188
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:54,019
of kicking a rock which could

189
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,209
potentially break your foot we're gonna

190
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:57,649
kick a cactus and since they're

191
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:59,329
basically just gonna keep trying to

192
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,459
steal each other's points we decided

193
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,709
people with the top points with me and

194
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:05,510
Gregg don't have a chance basically

195
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,640
whoever kicks the cactus the furthest

196
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,740
wins since you end of the seamount

197
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,439
points you guys can get normal but since

198
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,709
you're behind ya kick with your left

199
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,350
foot

200
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,890
whatever goes first - you can pick I

201
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,890
come with you

202
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:39,070
Mike's ready let's father though right

203
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:53,860
it hurts

204
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:54,730
oh yeah adrenalin enough oh god you guys

205
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,560
are crazy

206
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,320
alright you came to the furthest but we

207
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,550
talked about it yeah so I said like like

208
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,490
this is probably the most competitive

209
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:06,040
one so I'm down for like a three-way win

210
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,230
with these guys I'd be honored to share

211
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:21,340
that title with them first time at first

212
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:56,530
time swim through poi and underwear then

213
00:18:21,340 --> 00:19:01,020
make out with fish you'd rather kick a

214
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,020
cactus oh really it's fish

215
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,050
[Laughter]

216
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:19,980
