negative comments are just so

100
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:18,090
uninteresting sorry that was so bad but

101
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,949
yes that was a real comment see

102
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,750
basically my real answer is that I don't

103
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,949
really get affected by negative comments

104
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,150
anymore come on guys I've been doing

105
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:25,740
this for like eight years I'm pretty

106
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:36,750
sure I've seen everything seriously

107
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:41,669
your hair looks weird dude Oh am i

108
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:43,500
that's good I you're I can you rap like

109
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,389
Eminem in my opinion I think that Eminem

110
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,620
is one of if not the best rapper not

111
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,970
that I really know anything about rap

112
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,470
but ever since I was young he was always

113
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,180
my favorite and I guess the answer is

114
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,830
simple no I cannot rap like that I don't

115
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,270
think anyone can just because I can talk

116
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,800
fast it doesn't mean that I can rap it's

117
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,419

118
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,070
right he me go grab a ball lamps yeah

119
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,070
