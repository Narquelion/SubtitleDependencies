1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
and the laws now are catching it exactly

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,259
this is why Bitcoin and crypto and

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,150
decentralization is the next wave it's

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,620
the most important evolution of the

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,110
internet and that was how we were able

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,410
to sell out of our bags and then grow it

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:20,570
to like 10,000 bags 30,000 and 50,000

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,570
100,000 and then grow up to a million

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:33,360
clap are we supposed to clap

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,550

my car well for people who don't know

67
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,940
Michelle is an OG youtuber it's not

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,830
don't take that as an insult people

69
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,989
refer to me as that as well I'm David

70
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,310
I'm obviously sniff dog is OG he is

71
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,270
there you go

72
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,790
and I guess you were I don't know if you

73
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,530
were the first but probably the biggest

74
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,600
makeup guru right and the for the first

75
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,530
and biggest makeup guru Phoebe I'm sorry

76
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,330
I keep touching the tea and we're not

77
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,760
used to having these mics so I got to

78
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,980
stop touching the table hitting it yeah

79
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,970
the biggest and one of the first makeup

80
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,410
gurus on YouTube pretty much right and

81
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,150
basically I don't know how do you how

82
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:39,780
did you even get started well it was in

83
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:41,820
2007 I got rejected from a job a beauty

84
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:47,010
counter I needed a job because I needed

85
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:48,630
to pay my bills and I applied and always

86
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,280
good but then because I lacked sales

87
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,760
experience they didn't hire me that's so

88
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,510
ironic well we can get into that because

89
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,549
you have your own company which is like

90
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,920
like hugely successful where's your cup

91
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,360
it's valued at almost a billion dollars

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,280
right it's crazy

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,019
oh yeah if see I left the company two

94
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,459
years ago though right but you still

95
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,390
built you still started that company

96
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,200
initially and that company is like

97
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,109
really up worth a billion dollars

98
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,930
they're doing great they sell three

99
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,320
million bags a month for $10 each it's a

100
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,360
subscription model so it's very scalable

101
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,830
and it's helped a lot of indie brands

102
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,349
punch and become vegan

103
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,669
we'll get acquired by the big trifecta

104
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:32,159
beauty brands like Procter gamble

105
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,110
L'Oreal how far into YouTube did you

106
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:36,210
start that actually it was when I

107
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,219
reached a million subscribers and I was

108
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,080
I don't want to brag though but just to

109
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:42,750
give people some context I was the first

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,000
woman to have a million subscribers and

111
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,909
that that milestone I knew okay this is

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,849
a good milestone to think about having

113
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:51,960
longevity because I knew it's the

114
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:55,169
Internet people have such a short

115
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,849
attention span that I'm not going to

116
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,069
last as long my popularity is not gonna

117
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:00,719
last as long so I need another stream of

118
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,400
revenue that's not based on my human

119
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:04,530
bandwidth because we made this

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,090
comparison about how being a youtuber is

121
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,860
like being an uber driver and your car

122
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,240
is your channel and you have to drive

123
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,039
your car if you want to make money and

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,139
with YouTube it's the same way where you

125
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,180
have to constantly upload and post and

126
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,310
even your doing this podcast you got to

127
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,289
keep it moving you're an uber driver I

128
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,389
know but it's funny cuz didn't you say

129
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:24,689
you wanted to come back into it don't

130
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,430
you miss it I do miss it I don't like

131
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,620
the politics though cuz within the

132
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,060
beauty of space well see you're not in

133
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,099
the beauty space so you don't really see

134
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,840
all the drama I know you don't want to

135
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,419
be dude there's so much drama in the

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,469
beauty space beautiful

137
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:42,150
go ahead alright so what do you mean the

138
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:49,259
politics let's get into the rarity get

139
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:51,210
into the drama version or okay call them

140
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,589
out nah man I only drink to you I don't

141
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:57,089
spill I have a sense of nobility where

142
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,039
I'm not that's just not my thing

143
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:01,289
sure it's like karma take care of it you

144
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,979
know and also there's always two sides

145
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,259
to the story

146
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,990
with everyone and you know most

147
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,960
youtubers even the ones who are kind of

148
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,430
like a little up a little they

149
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,509
don't have the worst intentions it's

150
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:17,940
true right they don't and I they're just

151
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:21,150
normal people in a way if people see

152
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,979
them as this grand grandiose Idol but

153
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,770
once the camera turns off they're just a

154
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:28,889
normal person and i i i do actually feel

155
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,240
bad for a lot of youtubers and beauty

156
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,219
creators who do get pulled into the

157
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,839
drama and it has become hollywood or

158
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:37,500
especially within the beauty space

159
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,729
because there's so much money in it and

160
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,219
where there's money there's

161
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:44,400
a lot of people who are going in and who

162
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:45,870
want to be part of this economy I feel

163
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,080
like you're tiptoeing around something

164
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,339
like is there no I mean in the beauty

165
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,839
space you're saying there's a lot of

166
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,219
politics like give me an example of what

167
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,659
that means

168
00:06:53,219 --> 00:07:00,509
politics like a lot of these brands will

169
00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:01,770
pay - for sponsorships and so if there's

170
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,659
a product that's not good

171
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,610
a beauty creator will still say it's

172
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,409
good even though everyone knows it's not

173
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,389
good I like just selling out yeah

174
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:10,800
selling out so that's one ask well

175
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,860
you're luckily you don't have to do that

176
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,889
right don't but I got lucky

177
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,319
see I got it early and at that time in

178
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:21,659
2008 so this was right when the economy

179
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,819
crashed and I was sixteen thousand

180
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:25,499
dollars in debt no one was hiring I

181
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,629

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,729
life in two years yeah so I haven't like

210
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,919
clicked on anything on your channel and

211
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,659
randomly I just saw recently that your

212
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,880
your channel was suggested to me and it

213
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,440
was live yeah and I clicked on expecting

214
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,449
to see you and there was just like this

215
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,010
animation and just music playing and is

216
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:45,660
that that's what you're gonna be using

217
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,010
your channel for more or you're trying

218
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,899
to do something that's kind of like my

219
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,760
first it's like when you go to a party

220
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,240
and you just people who come in early

221
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,100
they can just enjoy the music

222
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,750
got it just setting the tone the

223
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,550
atmosphere it's really interesting that

224
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,279
you're using your channel in that way

225
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,770
yeah I mean you have those you know

226
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,560
those live streaming channels right yeah

227
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,870
the music ones I always had them years

228
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,580
ago playing in the background and people

229
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,200
actually loved watching my videos back

230
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,980
then because of my music that I

231
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,020
recommended mm-hmm and I have this

232
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,149
peer-to-peer marketplace I have this

233
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,760
peer-to-peer marketplace called thematic

234
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,250
where we help music creators and

235
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,260
creators link up and collaborate because

236
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,660
you know how hard it is to get music

237
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,450
rights and takedowns are mm-hmm

238
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,790
takedowns happen a lot and with article

239
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,410
13 and article 17 in the EU it's going

240
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,660
to become harder and harder and YouTube

241
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,920
now they're liable or anything copyright

242
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,040
it and so they don't want to be liable

243
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,810
for that so we have a lot of these

244
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,510
pre-cleared songs from actual music

245
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,220
artists for creators to use and so

246
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,830
that's a company that I founded because

247
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,070
I was sued years ago by a music label

248
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:56,440
and unfairly it was so unfair but it's

249
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,450
it's not even like there was no one's

250
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,399
fault there was a miscommunication along

251
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,380
the way like I have no hate or mmm-hmm

252
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,089
anything towards that music label what

253
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,850
happened with that lawsuit oh I just

254
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,589
settled it oh right I remember when that

255
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,089
was happening I was just like well

256
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:12,399
they're gonna I guess I could were kind

257
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:14,560
of big at the time too like that's what

258
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,420
you're a target yeah because I was

259
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,470
always like oh I thought we were safe

260
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,930
right cuz I thought were just

261
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,120
individuals who had like a big business

262
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,250
and well this is what happens that not

263
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,470
just me but even I'm not gonna say who

264
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,520
which youtuber this is cuz I don't know

265
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,320
if she wants me to say anything but

266
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,230
she's a big youtuber and she was in the

267
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,700
car just saying a lyric from a song just

268
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,839
saying it out loud like twinkle twinkle

269
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:40,329
little star and she got claimed to they

270
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,360
actually they actually hire people to

271
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:46,930
scour all the top youtubers so it's

272
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,370
sickening honestly there's one I one of

273
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,130
my biggest videos it's called proving

274
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,899
the Illuminati is real and the whole

275
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,160
video it got claimed I'm not gonna say

276
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,390
the lyric because they're gonna claim

277
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:03,790
this but in the end card of the video

278
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:06,390
what I rhyme with take me sup okay okay

279
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,800
something Lolo

280
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,050
something and I'm probably still gonna

281
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,570
get you know you know what song it is

282
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,340
but I said that in the endcard because I

283
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,270
was saying like wake up America right

284
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,270
wait

285
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,090
and then they claim the whole video and

286
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,500
there's nothing I can do about it and

287
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,870
that videos nothing to do with that it's

288
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,240
in the end card of the video I know what

289
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,620
you mean but that's that's how it is

290
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,620
that's it but that's why you created

291
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,210
sematic yeah but that wasn't even this I

292
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,690
wasn't using the song I just said the

293
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:39,340
lyric of it this is the sad part about I

294
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,320
mean the whole point of capitalism is

295
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,210
you're giving people have a chance to

296
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,210
build a business to build their capital

297
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,920
right they have a great product or they

298
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,980
have a great service that they can

299
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,830
provide competing against another and

300
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,260
it's better they can win it's it's that

301
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,960
opportunity that America gives to people

302
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,420
and I feel like when you have these big

303
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,890
lobbies whether it's like in the beauty

304
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,870
space or in the music space like the

305
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,910
ones who own everything they just make

306
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,430
it so unfair and harder for the smaller

307
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,780
people to win like they tell us like

308
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,220
yeah if you work really hard you have a

309
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,990
great idea you're gonna win that's

310
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,550
 you're not unless you have 20

311
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,410
lawyers and this is why Disney is so

312
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,810
well protected even though most of the

313
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,760
movies that they create are stolen like

314
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,040
all of the fairy tales I mean that's

315
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,780
these are fables that weren't owned by

316
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,560
anyone yeah you know what I mean

317
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,790
I mean I hundred percent understand and

318
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,030
that really just reminds me of like

319
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:36,160
making this drink has been such it just

320
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,750
opened my eyes I thought like okay I'm

321
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,220
just sorry I keep picking them out I'm

322
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,450
not used to having things that thing on

323
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,190
the table so I'm making noise so I

324
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:48,000
apologize for the listeners and viewers

325
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:50,200
okay okay but just like getting

326
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,360
approvals for things takes so much

327
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,620
longer and you don't realize that you

328
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,300
have to go through all these different

329
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,890
I'm just being really careful what I'm

330
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,210
saying cuz I don't know I don't want get

331
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,640
in trouble

332
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,540
I'm saw a politics politics that's why

333
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,930
I'm seeing the whole point of the

334
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,760
Internet yeah was it's it was this way

335
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,890
for everyone in the world to connect to

336
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,000
share ideas you could choose what they

337
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,370
want to watch and what they want to get

338
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,500
into yeah and the laws now are catching

339
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,050
it exactly this is why Bitcoin and

340
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,529
crypto and decentralization is the next

341
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,350
wave mm-hmm it's the

342
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,550
important evolution of the Internet yeah

343
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,439
you're really I noticed that you're

344
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,209
really into crypto and and that you know

345
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:28,910
you're very forward-thinking in

346
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:31,040
technology like what what about Bitcoin

347
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,670
are you like why do you believe in it so

348
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,499
much

349
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,470
well not everybody understands what it

350
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:40,309
is first off right it kind of boy sure

351
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:42,110
um well that's a big statement it's

352
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:44,089
because there's some so many different

353
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,459
components of what bitcoin is but if I

354
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:51,709
were to give an elevator pitch what is

355
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:53,749
Bitcoin Bitcoin is the the true money

356
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:55,430
the truth truest money that we should

357
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:59,089
have had since the beginning of time and

358
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:02,449
just to give some just just to make this

359
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:04,670
easier to digest um why is gold why was

360
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:07,550
gold always considered the standard for

361
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:10,009
money even during like the ancient days

362
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:13,309
in Egypt Mesopotamia why was it always

363
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:14,779
gold because gold one its finite so the

364
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:17,120
fact that you can't find it everywhere

365
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:23,750
two out of all the precious metals it is

366
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:25,639
the most stable metal and three it's

367
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,470
hard like it takes a lot of energy to

368
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,990
mine gold like you can figure out you

369
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,959
can even have scanners and scan for gold

370
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,029
but to pay for the labor to pay for the

371
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,040
cost of like the digging and the lit and

372
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:38,930
all the people feeding them and just to

373
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,550
get a little bit that's why it's so

374
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,120
expensive because it takes a lot of

375
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:47,480
energy to mine gold and it's finite so

376
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,389
now bringing it to Bitcoin Bitcoin

377
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,220
operates in the same way bitcoin is like

378
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,110
digital gold but it's different it's not

379
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,209
gold because gold you can carry it

380
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,129
intangible but Bitcoin it's digital

381
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,170
um but the fact that it's a scarce

382
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:01,730
digital asset is what makes it so unique

383
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,209
how is it scarce

384
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,620
there's only twenty-one million coins in

385
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,870
existence that's it there's never gonna

386
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,399
be more coins it's not like our money

387
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,529
the banks can just print more money

388
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,879
right they want to and they do it

389
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,279
without our permission not make more

390
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,600
Bitcoin you can't it is impossible that

391
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,689
is it there's only twenty-one million

392
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,709
units and we've Bitcoin has the white

393
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:26,149
paper started in 2008 Satoshi created

394
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:29,420
this white paper and no one even knows

395
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:31,250
who suck no she is um it was an

396
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,270
anonymous person who came up with this

397
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,220
thesis what is Bitcoin

398
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,690
it's essentially a currency that's not

399
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,580
built on trust because if you look at

400
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,950
the back of your dollar it says In God

401
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:44,130
We Trust telling us trust in this dollar

402
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:47,580
it's money it's it's it's a real money

403
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:49,830
it's a it's a legal tender but can I go

404
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,870
into Fort Knox to count all the gold no

405
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,460
but with Bitcoin you can you can verify

406
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,740
everything everything's time-stamped

407
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,850
there's verification and so you have a

408
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,440
currency that's not built on trust

409
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,870
because people don't trust anyone

410
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,480
anymore you trust but verify and this is

411
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:07,890
what bitcoin brings to the table so um

412
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:12,720
since 2008 we've mined up to I believe

413
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:15,330
17 million Bitcoin units and six million

414
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,120
four million of them are lost meaning

415
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:20,010
four million Bitcoin people lost their

416
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,670
private keys which means we will never

417
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,640
see it again

418
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,890
it's impossible to retrieve it um and so

419
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,380
that even that drove the scarcity even

420
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,630
more it's even more scarce when you say

421
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,620
you mind I'm just because I really don't

422
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:35,310
know I'm not trying to like break it

423
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:37,620
down to me easy you mind a Bitcoin what

424
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:40,620
does that entail exactly it entails it's

425
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,780
essentially - mine - mine a Bitcoin you

426
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,280
need to have a computer you could have

427
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,540
had a normal computer back then it would

428
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,400
have been easier to mine but today you

429
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,590
need a lot of computers a lot of energy

430
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,870
because it's solving very hard math

431
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,790
questions and I think we've just reached

432
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,010
a halving point which means now it's

433
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,660
gonna be even harder to solve these math

434
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,640
questions it becomes exponentially

435
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,430
harder and they say the last few hundred

436
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,830
bitcoins will take several years and the

437
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:09,210
last one will probably probably be mined

438
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:11,340
by 21:40 21:40 will be the last Bitcoin

439
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,140
they say theoretically speaking if we

440
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,240
haven't come up with if we haven't

441
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,590
advanced into quantum computing yet well

442
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,360
it will take another hundred years by

443
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:21,450
solving these these math equations

444
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,610
though what that's kind of like what are

445
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:28,650
you getting from them just a number or

446
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:30,330
like what are you getting exactly what

447
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,130
is a Bitcoin like if you're solving

448
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,930
these if you're solving these I'm trying

449
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,240
to think of something like I'm picturing

450
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,470
a coin okay actual Bitcoin right or what

451
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,390
they think they're local the cool thing

452
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,420
about a bit Queen is you can buy them in

453
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,620
decimals meaning that you can buy them

454
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,480
in fractions you don't have to buy a

455
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,440
whole Bitcoin you can buy half of a

456
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Bitcoin

457
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,910
one-tenth of a Bitcoin it'll called

458
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,850
Satoshi's by uh Satoshi and they say in

459
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,370
the future so one Bitcoin is a hundred

460
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,050
thousand satoshis it's like pennies it's

461
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,640
like having a hundred pennies equals one

462
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,460
dollar so a hundred thousand satoshis

463
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,370
equals one Bitcoin they say the one

464
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,500
Satoshi in the future would be worth ten

465
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,610
dollars so imagine what a full Bitcoin

466
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,620
will be worth I mean some have even

467
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,900
speculated this is the craziest number a

468
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,660
million for one one Bitcoin in the

469
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,150
future so you're saying there's 21

470
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,460
million and that's a cap right that's it

471
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,950
right it's finite who decided or is it

472
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,840
that's how she decided okay so it is a

473
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,380
construct of somebody the protocol yes

474
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:31,710
right

475
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:33,450
but he's said of intelligent agencies we

476
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,790
don't know who's to say that that person

477
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,880
right could just be like alright here's

478
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,860
more you can't it's just impossible

479
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,260
because the moment you don't follow the

480
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:48,690
protocol and then bitcoins worthless

481
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:50,130
right well I mean if it does happen then

482
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,750
bitcoins worthless but it's not gonna

483
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,580
happen because because you have people

484
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,490
who verify you have miners who are

485
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,380
verifying it who are making sure they're

486
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,030
mining it and everyone can verify it

487
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,860
like I said it's open-source those

488
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,750
Ledger's there's timestamps like you

489
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,270
can't it's actually impossible right but

490
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,500
like like how you said gold is a finite

491
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,150
thing right it's something you can hold

492
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,080
it's there it'll always be there

493
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:15,870
physically and like the the US dollar it

494
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,820
has value we all verify has value right

495
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:22,740
but it could instantly become worthless

496
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:25,440
right we've given it right week we gave

497
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,720
it value after around the Vietnam War

498
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,600
when actually it was actually the

499
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,490
Vietnam War when the dollar went off of

500
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,170
the gold standard so originally we were

501
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,360
on the gold standard and became less and

502
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,100
less and less and the Vietnam War

503
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,930
happened and that was when we became off

504
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,340
the gold standard that was when they

505
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,260
started to sign treaties with Saudi

506
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,320
Arabia to back up our dollar by

507
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:49,470
petroleum that's why you have the petro

508
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,870
dollar and again politics comes into

509
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:54,390
place in all of this um and the beauty

510
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,830
with Bitcoin is no one owns it like with

511
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,180
the dollar the Federal Reserve owns a

512
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,620
dollar but if you look at who is the

513
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,010
Federal Reserve it's not the people it's

514
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,780
private banks

515
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,820
right the bitcoins owned by no one

516
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,559
mm-hmm even the banks the banks could

517
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,610
buy half of all the Bitcoin and that's

518
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,080
actually what a lot of them aren't

519
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,970
looking into buying because they're

520
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,280
realizing wait we can't stop this we

521
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,440
should buy some because in the future it

522
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,570
might I mean there's theories but some

523
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,670
people say in the future some countries

524
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,960
might even buy a ton of Bitcoin and

525
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,570
their money is backed up by their

526
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,710
Bitcoin their Bitcoin reserve

527
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,230
interesting so you're buying a digital

528
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,000
land yeah like you're buying digital

529
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,250
real estate you know how real estate is

530
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,320
expensive because land is very finite

531
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,360
young that's essentially what they coin

532
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,429
is but the thing is with real estate and

533
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,870
like with gold you can physically like

534
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:39,700
that you can't just that won't no one

535
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,260
can take that away from you right I mean

536
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,900
unless they physically take it away from

537
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:47,380
you right with Bitcoin I just feel like

538
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:50,500
how do you know it could like if you

539
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:53,230
could you show me right now if your

540
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,640
bitcoins yeah I mean like I'm trying to

541
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,950
say how do you know it's not gonna

542
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,960
disappear based on like someone or

543
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,160
somebody else in the future well just

544
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,290
make sure you have your private keys

545
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,350
make sure you have your private keys and

546
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:06,640
an offline wallet in cold storage just

547
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,830
like you're not gonna have your your

548
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,240
gold on your table you're gonna have it

549
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,160
buried in the backyard you're gonna have

550
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,320
it and it is safe you know in a 10 hour

551
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,000
fireproof safe but you're not going to

552
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,200
take your gold and and like chip off a

553
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,030
little bit and go to Starbucks really

554
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,600
hey can I buy like no they're not gonna

555
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,210
do that

556
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,920
it's Bitcoin is not a lot of people

557
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,990
think well I'm not am I gonna buy things

558
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,000
with Bitcoin not necessarily there could

559
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,670
be future crypto currencies that are

560
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,880
backed up by Bitcoin but Bitcoin is the

561
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:36,160
reserve Bitcoin like gold protects your

562
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,230
purchasing power when the banks fail if

563
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,880
you have gold you're still good you can

564
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,890
still buy bread if you need to right

565
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,900
that's that this is how Bitcoin helps

566
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,190
people or something happens to the bank

567
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,230
something happens to earn money there's

568
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,760
a war you still have your private keys

569
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,940
and you can still protect your

570
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,150
purchasing power mm-hmm okay cuz I was

571
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,620
just trying to think like bear like

572
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,230
technology goes away right like it's

573
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,850
it's a apocalypse right Gold still has

574
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,800
value because you can use sure but you

575
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,210
know when when technology goes away the

576
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,920
last thing we're gonna care about is

577
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,720
we're gonna try and make fire we're

578
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,250
gonna try any exactly gold still has

579
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,320
value right because it's a metal because

580
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,750
it is finite you can melt it

581
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,430
examine it yes then we go to the true

582
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,350
gold standard but do you see us going

583
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,970
away from the digital I'm just saying

584
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,200
I'm just trying to I'm not saying I'm

585
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,760
just going to picture in my head because

586
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,490
I'm trying to figure out what Bitcoin

587
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,560
really is I never I always understood it

588
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:28,600
I just don't know why they've done tests

589
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,540
now I think like an appalled or

590
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,790
somewhere else where you can still send

591
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,950
Bitcoin is someone without fast internet

592
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,540
mm-hmm it's just gonna take a longer

593
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,020
time but you can still send it without

594
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:47,770
the internet Wow so how much Bitcoin do

595
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:49,600
you have is you know like here in

596
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,860
America or the Western world I don't

597
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,420
wanna say America but just in their

598
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,770
Western world the culture is everyone's

599
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,270
trying to flaunt through wealth like you

600
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,890
want to be on the front cover of Forbes

601
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,480
like yeah I'm rich well but then that

602
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,530
turns you into a target you know

603
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,480
interesting is I was reading an article

604
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,490
about in China a lot of the wealthy

605
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,460
people in China will pay money to these

606
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,080
magazines not just to tell it to put

607
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,090
them on the list because they want to

608
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,710
protect they want to be low-key about it

609
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,630
because they know they're gonna become a

610
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,980
target I mean I became a target that's

611
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,240
all yeah yeah that's what happened

612
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,800
that's why I've been just staying

613
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,630
low-key so the same with Bitcoin is

614
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,680
don't tell people you're a Bitcoin

615
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,930
billionaire you know you're gonna

616
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,440
attackers coming at you good thing we're

617
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,140
broke

618
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:37,030
we're so broke I'm no Bitcoin I have

619
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:39,220
seven okay sorry I was I didn't mean to

620
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:41,710
stay on that I just like I got it was

621
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,940
really trying to figure out what I never

622
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,740
knew I never understood it it's

623
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,380
fascinating it is it is a little

624
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,630
interesting only thing I know about

625
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,890
Bitcoin is that's why I like graphic

626
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,700
cards are getting expensive for

627
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:58,150
computers yeah it's harder to like pay

628
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,880
for the Facebook one I know it's not the

629
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,130
same thing but is that it's okay so the

630
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,200
Facebook Libre queen think of it like

631
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,670
Facebook is an arcade and you go in and

632
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,800
you exchange your dollar into the

633
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,990
quarters and that's what so you can only

634
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,980
use it within their ecosystem oh so

635
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,450
that's different then it's totally

636
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,760
different it's not the same it's not a

637
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,680
competitor I would I wouldn't even say

638
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,140
its competitor it could be one day

639
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,150
no because Bitcoin again it's finite

640
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,310
what about bitcoins competitors there's

641
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,480
other versions yeah but they're not

642
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,040
competitors they

643
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,169
offer different things util it like

644
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,150
their utility coins like aetherium they

645
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:32,320
offer different rings and some of them

646
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,669
will say like yeah we're faster than

647
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,860
Bitcoin we're better but it's like no

648
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:37,090
Bitcoin there's a reason why bitcoin is

649
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,160
at all right now

650
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,299
let's see how much it's at I know at one

651
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:45,460
point I think it was at 20 for a while

652
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:46,990
they say soon it's gonna go up to 30

653
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,820
thousand since are you recommending for

654
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:51,280
us so should we put in the title

655
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,990
why michelle phan says to buy bitcoin

656
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,790
now and then if they're sell their

657
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,799
things go up Bitcoin is at eleven

658
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,630
thousand eight hundred but it might go

659
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,340
down to nine thousand and migrate on a

660
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,870
three thousand if it does then you start

661
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,970
buying if it goes down to three thousand

662
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,740
because that's ridiculous really

663
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:08,530
but I tell people don't like stock

664
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:11,190
spaces it's not stocks well it's not but

665
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:13,780
it's not stocks like it's not even it's

666
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:16,000
gold isn't a stock Gold is a reserve

667
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,540
like she really think bitcoin is like

668
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,880
gold i think bitcoin is digital gold

669
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:25,120
digital gold real estate because it's

670
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,220
finite and it follows a protocol it's

671
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,929
all about following the protocol and for

672
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,790
over ten years it hasn't slipped it

673
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:34,600
hasn't even steered an inch away from

674
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:37,450
the protocol it's so when would you I

675
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,030
mean like you got in early hmm when

676
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:43,299
would you at what point do you yourself

677
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:45,220
decide I want to sell it okay so there's

678
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:48,010
different so you know I'm gonna have to

679
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,830
sell it you could buy a house with

680
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:52,360
Bitcoin I've seen a video and you know

681
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,309
the cool thing is you don't have to deal

682
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,620
with taxes or anything cuz it's at

683
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:59,679
illegal no one that's legal like no one

684
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:02,980
owns it's not government regulated I see

685
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,500
it's not and in a way we have the

686
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,059
internet we should have had a money that

687
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,200
went we should have had a currency that

688
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:10,059
went with the internet but we have in

689
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,980
everything's been tied to banks like

690
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:14,530
doing it so I was reading about how

691
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,460
there is 400 million dollars a Bitcoin

692
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,559
that was moved

693
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,860
guess how much the transaction fee was

694
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:23,679
four hundred million dollars just guess

695
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:26,500
Wow yeah with two dollars yeah exactly -

696
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,260
I'm a genius I know about Bitcoin but

697
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,090
you know in Zimbabwe they have a crazy

698
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,909
currency out there like I think they

699
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:35,740
have a note that's 100 trillion dollars

700
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:37,630
they have one note that's a hundred

701
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,620
trillion guess how much it's worth in

702
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,320
u.s.

703
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:46,090
I have no idea two dollars forty cents

704
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,850
but locally I think two days ago locally

705
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:51,720
in Zimbabwe Bitcoin was at seventy two

706
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:54,850
thousand dollars locally oh really yeah

707
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,950
that's crazy it dude like this is just

708
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,909
the beginning everyone so slept on it

709
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,730
I've been telling people for years

710
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:03,460
Bitcoin it's the future

711
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,230
well the hype sure died down because it

712
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,269
was at like 20-something when everybody

713
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,590
was buying Yeah right and I thought well

714
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:12,940
when it's down that's when you buy you

715
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:15,820
guys Warren Buffett did with stocks

716
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,580
yeah but Warren Buffett said um Bitcoin

717
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,809
is rat poison and now he's kind of

718
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,190
eating his words and he's talking to

719
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:25,659
crypto people oh really

720
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:27,429
yeah interesting okay well that went

721
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:30,749
down around I did not know I'm just like

722
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:30,749
alright well how do we do this though

723
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,590
like negative things around it though

724
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,879
like I mean whether it's true or not

725
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,899
well so was YouTube in the beginning

726
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:42,850
well you can make money on YouTube

727
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:45,340
that's so dumb yeah and the content -

728
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:47,049
they're talking about some parts you

729
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,700
can't argue there was a lot of dumb

730
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:50,590
stuff they're still dumb stuff but it

731
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,320
makes money there's people watch TV yeah

732
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,779
that's true - yeah well I'm talking like

733
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,600
current YouTube dumb stuff oh yeah

734
00:27:55,779 --> 00:28:00,279
clickbait oh yeah everyone's there was

735
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,669
pick me before - though that's true but

736
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:05,980
I feel like now algorithm on YouTube has

737
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:07,269
become like a up god everyone's

738
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,070
trying to please and everyone's trying

739
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,869
to chase after and get and understand

740
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,330
and they're trying to optimize their

741
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:16,179
content to favor the algorithm there's

742
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,619
literal groups of youtubers I'm not

743
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:19,809
gonna say who but there's groups that

744
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:22,090
talk about this and this they tell each

745
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:24,279
other do you know about this anyone

746
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:28,779
there's a there's a discord channel it

747
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:30,549
will analyze the algorithm like on a

748
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:32,110
daily basis it's pretty pretty intense

749
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:34,450
to get oh can you send me that channel

750
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:37,409
yeah I just like to read it yep it's

751
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:40,529
interesting it is interesting but it I

752
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:43,570
it's hard to keep up with the changes I

753
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:45,039
would say that it never ends yeah never

754
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,320
ends they don't have to tell us either

755
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:51,010

756
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:54,070

00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:55,570
we're getting back into it a little bit

775
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,040
but getting away from Krypto actually is

776
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,420
that so talking about Krypto we were

777
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:03,010
just talking about your other company M

778
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:08,560
cosmetics right it's awesome that's a

779
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:10,330
second one did you why yes I did i

780
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,790
completely engineered the opening sound

781
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:14,410
to sound delicious and fresh we're just

782
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:19,090
talking about this off camera because

783
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:20,560
thanks because um I I didn't do that but

784
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:24,100
you asked me that and you said I should

785
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,260
tell more people that see Ryan says I

786
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,120
can't lie to people and I said marketing

787
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,790
isn't lying or just exaggerating okay

788
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:34,630
but I didn't invent that sound sound

789
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:36,820
that's just science things were actually

790
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:39,040
people who engineer sounds like that

791
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:42,580
like the Snapple bottle that yes okay

792
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:47,140
that is satisfying yeah but I am yeah I

793
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:48,580
made that I made it up what we were

794
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:53,140
talking about were just talking about I

795
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:54,910
distract em cosmetics I have and look

796
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,200
this isn't sponsored or anything David

797
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,240
wanted to bring this up because he

798
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,040
stopped by my office interesting story

799
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,720
few months ago

800
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,630
and he was asking like yeah so what's up

801
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,010
with this em cosmetics thing how how did

802
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,740
this come about mmm

803
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,480
so to give you some perspective most

804
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,850
people who start a beauty brand they

805
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,960
start it they boot strap it they you

806
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,130
know you have a startup so you

807
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,170
understand like you put your own money

808
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,430
into it and you grow it and then if you

809
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,470
get around like a million to five

810
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:22,470
million a year pretty good but when you

811
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,960
get up to around 10 to 20 million up to

812
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,820
like 50 million this is when bigger

813
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,610
brands like the Estee Lauder the L'Oreal

814
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,050
the Procter & Gamble they want to they

815
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,300
are interested in acquiring your brand

816
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:35,040
so they want to acquire it and then they

817
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,150
take your existing company in your brand

818
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,800
and then they just power through and

819
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,750
turn it into a billion-dollar company so

820
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:43,020
they buy you out and that's normally the

821
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:44,100
lifecycle for value meaning like you

822
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,660
don't have any part of it once it

823
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,710
becomes a billion-dollar company no it

824
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,290
doesn't become a billion-dollar company

825
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:52,380
they buy you at 50 million so they turn

826
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:55,440
it into a billion-dollar company okay so

827
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,200
with em we did the exact opposite my

828
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,360
brand was actually created with L'Oreal

829
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,250
and this was the first time in 2011

830
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,960
L'Oreal has ever created a brand from

831
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,370
the ground up normally they acquire

832
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,840
brand that's what they're really good at

833
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:09,360
they acquire the brands and they grow it

834
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,820
into a big business like NYX Urban Decay

835
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,740
it cosmetics and in my case with em

836
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,420
they're like hey Michele she's doing

837
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,400
this really cool thing on YouTube let's

838
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,280
take a gamble and let's create a beauty

839
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,500
brand with her and granted L'Oreal is a

840
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:26,010
great they're masters when it comes to

841
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:30,210
marketing creating beauty products

842
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:32,280
expanding on that but creating a brand

843
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:35,010
from the start you know from the ground

844
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:38,010
up it's hard it is hard because you need

845
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,840
to have you you can't take a corporate

846
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:42,030
structure and then bring it into the

847
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,330
startup world it's really hard to do

848
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:46,770
that because you have to oftentimes a

849
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:50,310
lot of the corporate structures there's

850
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:51,780
so many layers and bureaucracies and to

851
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:54,090
get one thing approved you have to go

852
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,890
through 15 different people on a startup

853
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,620
you just talk to three people and that's

854
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:00,300
it it's instant umm and so what's

855
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,970
interesting was when I was developing

856
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,400
the brand with L'Oreal and this was in

857
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:08,160
2011 I was also building it C at the

858
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,530
same time so in New York I'm building

859
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,700
MCAS medics with L'Oreal and I fly back

860
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,740
to LA San Francisco and

861
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,360
building obscene doing the two and it's

862
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,000
it was interesting seeing the dichotomy

863
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,520
between the two worlds because on the

864
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,260
Loreal side they here they had a lot of

865
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,000
budget and a lot of people a lot of

866
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,380
bodies in the company building the brand

867
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,570
with me but because we had too many

868
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,030
people involved things became very

869
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:33,430
convoluted my vision became convoluted

870
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:35,680
along with it um but then on the other

871
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:37,240
side of the spectrum we had it see where

872
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,520
we only had two point seven million

873
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,200
dollars seed funding and that was it and

874
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,960
we were able to use that money and

875
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,460
stretch it and go go completely

876
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,190
grassroots like our marketing was

877
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,570
through YouTube we would just talk

878
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,700
directly to these brands and that was

879
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,830
how we were able to sell out of our bags

880
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,900
and then grow it to like ten thousand

881
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,670
bags thirty thousand fifty thousand a

882
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,250
hundred thousand and then grew up up to

883
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:03,610
a million and then when we launched em

884
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:06,190
cosmetics in 2013 with L'Oreal it

885
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:07,480
flopped it's completely flopped people

886
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,580
were hating on the brand because they

887
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,710
said the packaging looked so cheap

888
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,660
the praat like it was too expensive it

889
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,880
didn't look like me and I was getting so

890
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,840
much hate even though I had no control

891
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,790
over anything

892
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,310
I really didn't because it really was

893
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,940
not like your branding then it wasn't no

894
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,560
boss

895
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,360
when people saw when people watch my

896
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,490
videos I'm known for a certain aesthetic

897
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,190
and they were so confused when they saw

898
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:32,620
em by L'Oreal because it wasn't it was

899
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:35,350
completely off of my aesthetic um it was

900
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,730
an authentic it was not authentic no so

901
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,990
I got a lot of hate and it really sucked

902
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,460
because I couldn't say anything

903
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:43,020
you know I'm under certain contract so

904
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:46,300
I'm like you know NDA's and all of that

905
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,710
long story short I was stuck and but

906
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,300
thankfully I had epsy that was draining

907
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,220
really well so in a way that was kind of

908
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,380
my savings my saving grace like that

909
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,060
saved my face like I wasn't seen as a

910
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,030
failure because even though the

911
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,830
cosmetics L'Oreal flopped if she was

912
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:02,680
here zip see like doing two million bags

913
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,210
doing really well and we only needed 2.7

914
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,180
million dollars and we never need it to

915
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:11,050
raise sense right um so really shows you

916
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:13,510
it's not about like legacy companies

917
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:15,370
like these big companies like you know

918
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,020
Google when Google started Google+ they

919
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,550
thought oh we can take down Facebook or

920
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,590
Facebook is like let's take down tik-tok

921
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,840
and launch last so like now dude like

922
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,850
innovation comes from small startups

923
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,349
it's always been like that that's where

924
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,789
you really truly see it because you

925
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:29,470
people who are very passionate and again

926
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:30,819
you don't have so many different layers

927
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,900
of people you have to go through to

928
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:37,979
approve one thing and if C is a great

929
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:40,960
testament of that so going back to 2015

930
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:43,259
we raise 100 million dollars for epsy

931
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,089
were able to use that money to buy em

932
00:35:43,259 --> 00:35:49,089
from L'Oreal and to acquire it under

933
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:51,549
Ipsy which was great but again it wasn't

934
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:53,710
my brand it was oopsies so I couldn't

935
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:56,170
approve everything of course even though

936
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,150
I am a founder of Ipsy I have shares in

937
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,589
it there's still a lot of politics when

938
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:03,670
you do raise money for a company you

939
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:05,979
give up some some control um and it got

940
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:08,710
to a point where I just became so tired

941
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:10,900
I just wanted something that was mine I

942
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,910
was ready to also be independent and so

943
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,519
two years ago I left obscene and I

944
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:21,130
bought my brand back and so M now is

945
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:23,140
completely owned by me and that's

946
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:26,229
awesome and it's just been incredible

947
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,450
because we're small but it feels like a

948
00:36:26,229 --> 00:36:30,009
family unit well when you say small it's

949
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,329
a guessing comparison to the other

950
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:32,410
things we've seen your office it's not

951
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:36,009
oh yeah

952
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:37,210
it's sick it's not small but I guess it

953
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:39,969
come in compared to what you I mean

954
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:42,249
compared to having 200 employees now

955
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:44,859
having like twelve it is really small

956
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:46,839
but we are forced to be reckoned with

957
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:49,539
because we everyone can wear multiple

958
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:51,910
hats like this I thrive in smaller

959
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:54,309
environments I can't do a corporate

960
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:56,890
companies I just can't it's just I think

961
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:59,319
it's it's so opposite of even who we are

962
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,999
yeah right like you probably get more

963
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:02,440
work done if you were to just work with

964
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,819
you and a few of your friends and if you

965
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,529
were thrown into like an office right

966
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:07,329
yeah you have a hundred people and

967
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:09,069
everyone just focus on one job rather

968
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:10,450
than collaborating it becomes super

969
00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:12,579
hyper specialist and you

970
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,979
compartmentalize it's like oh so-and-so

971
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:16,450
does that to refer to them rather than

972
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:18,190
owning it together you're owning the

973
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:20,619
project together then because if it's

974
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,880
all you know individuals it always ends

975
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:24,190
up being like alright I'm just gonna do

976
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,630
my job pass it off if they're not doing

977
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,869
their job that I don't care I'm doing my

978
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,960
thing

979
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:30,789
exactly yeah that's that's tough well in

980
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,160
trying I got a question so you know

981
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:35,019
you're very successful entrepreneur

982
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,490
obviously and you've built large

983
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:40,130
companies

984
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:42,200
what are like the top three things are

985
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:44,750
or there's the top things that you you

986
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,130
think are required for people out there

987
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,260
who are trying to start something like

988
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,900
you did like what are some of these

989
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,060
things that you feel like can help build

990
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,830
a massive business like you have a

991
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,420
billion-dollar billion-dollar business

992
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,260
how do you make a billion-dollar

993
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,200
business

994
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,000
well okay evaluation let's rephrase that

995
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,260
what does it even mean to be worth a

996
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,599
billion dollars because you look at

997
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:07,220
netflix and they're worth a billion

998
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,950
dollars but they haven't profited yet

999
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,990
gee um you look at even Amazon I think

1000
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,820
even Amazon is still in a deficit or

1001
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:16,580
something they started to make more

1002
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,780
money weirdly enough with Amazon Web

1003
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,000
service so for the longest time

1004
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,950
Amazon wasn't profiting really yeah they

1005
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,810
weren't profiting freely years years

1006
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,150
years and I don't know which year it was

1007
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:28,790
at 2015 or fourteen I forgot which year

1008
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,980
but Bezos because so many people were

1009
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,690
using Amazon they needed the best

1010
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,480
servers they needed private servers and

1011
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,580
all that he decided okay let's let's do

1012
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,530
redundancy servers where we build more

1013
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:42,109
servers because if one server shuts down

1014
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:43,580
Amazon can still run in like Colorado

1015
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:45,020
because we have the servers there so

1016
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,510
they did redundancy and it took a whole

1017
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:49,609
year to build several several different

1018
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:52,339
servers all across the nation for farms

1019
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:54,349
server farms okay and when he went to

1020
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:55,790
the board and he was talented oh no he

1021
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:57,740
didn't go to the board yet he had the

1022
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,480
engineers come to him and say okay we

1023
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,570
finished everything and he was curious

1024
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,160
he asked um how much is Amazon using of

1025
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,109
all these servers no like oh just like

1026
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,690
six or twelve percent like very little

1027
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:10,490
and he had an aha moment he went to the

1028
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,320
board he said hey let's create a

1029
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,599
subscription amazon web servers because

1030
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,060
we're only using a very small amount and

1031
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,670
we have all this excess and we can make

1032
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,109
money with just servers if you think

1033
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,089
about it it's like genius because you're

1034
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,650
not selling product you're not storing

1035
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:27,230
anything you don't have to ship anything

1036
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:27,859
it's just a subscription it's just data

1037
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,570
yeah

1038
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:31,339
and that helped them make tremendous

1039
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,380
money and so now when you opt in to

1040
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:35,390
Amazon web servers it's so impressive

1041
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,740
because you can get like you can have

1042
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,510
like machine learning involved in there

1043
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,000
I mean it's crazy like it's not just a

1044
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:44,060
normal it's not a basic setup like it's

1045
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,130
very very robust and impressive so again

1046
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,869
like going back to the valuation having

1047
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,310
a billion dollars that's like height

1048
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:51,109
that's like saying oh yeah my company is

1049
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,849
worth a billion but

1050
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:54,440
doesn't necessarily mean you're making a

1051
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:56,119
billion dollars that's what the

1052
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,549
investors who invested in your company

1053
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:01,009
are projecting for you to be worth and

1054
00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:02,869
to make something sense know so a lot of

1055
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:05,059
a lot of these companies who raise like

1056
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:07,190
80 million dollars and they still don't

1057
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:08,359
profit yet but then their investors will

1058
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,400
be like yeah they're worth like a

1059
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:13,069
billion dollars they can go out and say

1060
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,349
that so it's kind of hype um thankfully

1061
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:16,700
with Ipsy we were so anti hype we were

1062
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:19,609
actually doing really well because we

1063
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,529
were subscription people were paying $10

1064
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:24,890
a month and three million bags are being

1065
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:27,019
sold um but we weren't like we weren't

1066
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,849
relying on that hype of being worth a

1067
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:30,980
billion dollars so to go back to

1068
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:32,509
everything I don't think I think if you

1069
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,119
have the intention to build a billion

1070
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:37,369
billion dollar company you don't have

1071
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,970
the right intention in place you your

1072
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:42,710
goal is mislead by numbers and what ends

1073
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:45,259
up happening is if you don't meet these

1074
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,849
numbers and these milestones oftentimes

1075
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:48,259
you can lose sight of yourself and you

1076
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:50,390
can burn out really fast and I always

1077
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:54,049
tell people and potential business

1078
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:56,059
owners and entrepreneurs don't set goals

1079
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:58,670
set intentions first I think when I

1080
00:40:56,059 --> 00:41:00,079
started my youtube channel there was no

1081
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,420
money in it because there is no Adsense

1082
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,789
right but my intention was to teach I

1083
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,279
wanted to share I want to teach when I

1084
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:09,140
started epsy I wasn't I didn't have any

1085
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:10,730
idea would become such a big thing but

1086
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,769
my intention was I have this great

1087
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:14,900
product idea and I want to help people

1088
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:17,420
with it I think that's really important

1089
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:20,029
so intention set intentions and the

1090
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,099
second thing is look for a market gap

1091
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:23,690
that's really important too because you

1092
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:27,259
can have a really good product idea or

1093
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:29,480
service but if it's too early on then

1094
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:31,430
you miss out on that boat so you have to

1095
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,859
be you have to know when to be ready to

1096
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:36,230
launch it oftentimes so many people have

1097
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:39,440
great ideas but it's too early or it's

1098
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:41,690
too late so learn and observe the

1099
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,630
different market gaps that you have and

1100
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:47,509
market gaps so to bring it to bring this

1101
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,249
into like I was like to like bring it

1102
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:53,029
into my context because my viewers might

1103
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:55,309
understand in 2007 there were no makeup

1104
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:56,660
tutorials people if people wanted to

1105
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:58,009
learn makeup videos they would either

1106
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,900
have to go to a beauty counter and buy

1107
00:41:58,009 --> 00:42:02,630
products or pay for Beauty seminars or

1108
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,980
read books and there is never something

1109
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,300
where they can just sit at home and

1110
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,550
watch for free and rewind

1111
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,370
fast-forward skip and have someone

1112
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:12,920
relatable speaking to them so that's a

1113
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:14,360
market gap market gap is wait no one's

1114
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,550
making these videos I'm gonna make them

1115
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,920
so identify these market gaps in the

1116
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:22,940
market I would that's one of the first

1117
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,670
things you would say to like yeah set

1118
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:35,270
the intention finding the market gap and

1119
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:37,220
I guess my third one top tips

1120
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,630
those are good tips and I think it is

1121
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,340
important most people don't know when

1122
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,900
they hear like oh the evaluation is a

1123
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,430
billion dollars they don't know you're

1124
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,110
not making a billion making like

1125
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,360
snapchat for one there were another one

1126
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,070
right that wasn't making dairy I don't

1127
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,630
know what their what are they worth well

1128
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,640
their IPO right note there they're a

1129
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,410
public company right now but I think for

1130
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,540
a long time they were making zero

1131
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,440
dollars no money at all but they were

1132
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,540
like the biggest thing in the world

1133
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,490
because they had active users they had

1134
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,530
millions of active users and so the idea

1135
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:05,120
is like everyone wants to find the next

1136
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,370
Facebook but for me it's like it's over

1137
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,560
because all Facebook needs to do is just

1138
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,390
copy it which is totally what I did yeah

1139
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,770
yeah and there's no shame in that like

1140
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,390
as in they don't see shame in that

1141
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,370
because they have to look out for their

1142
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,100
business and that's just how a cutthroat

1143
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:20,600
it is China copies it too you know like

1144
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,730
everyone's just copying each other and

1145
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,960
that's why I always tell people don't

1146
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,090
try and like create something that

1147
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,740
Facebook can easily copy like look at

1148
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:30,260
the future market gap if we are going

1149
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,640
towards this decentralized market place

1150
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,640
where money will even become

1151
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,260
decentralized build towards that that's

1152
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,370
gonna start happening in the next 10

1153
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,870
years you want to build towards the

1154
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:41,450
future if you want to build something

1155
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,400
that you can sell fast and now then yeah

1156
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:45,680
sure like build something that's

1157
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,140
hyperbole and then try and find an exit

1158
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,910
fast as you can but oftentimes when you

1159
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,140
don't find an exit you're stuck you're

1160
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:54,260
like a hamster in a wheel and you're

1161
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:58,100
stuck and you're in this very old old

1162
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:59,900
company that makes sense okay good

1163
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,940
advice yeah that is good advice actually

1164
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,140
I'm sure some people there's probably a

1165
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,230
lot of people who are like I'm gonna get

1166
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,970
Bitcoin I'm gonna start my own company

1167
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:10,010
what do people need right now so I don't

1168
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:13,520
know I think it's there you go

1169
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:15,290
ninja my energy not paid for yeah I

1170
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,400

1171
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:22,089

well two bitcoins I don't I don't that's

1173

one of my co-workers I can't hook him

1202
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:35,650
and like sent him really far away like

1203
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,819
physically yeah like walked him escorted

1204
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,539
him off the property

1205
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:42,940
and I think like it was like a few days

1206
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:45,970
later I was in had Instagram stories I

1207
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:49,299
was going to one of my friends show he's

1208
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:52,839
he he was DJing at this show and I was

1209
00:45:49,299 --> 00:45:54,880
gonna go and support so I when I arrived

1210
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:56,440
with my other friend I hear this guy

1211
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,809
he's like Michelle so your first

1212
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,609
instinct when you hear your name is turn

1213
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:02,260
around right so I turned around and I

1214
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:05,680
remember him from the picture I'm like

1215
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:07,059
oh I shouldn't same guy right and he's

1216
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,349
like Michelle Michelle but thankfully my

1217
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:10,390
friend was there was just blocking him

1218
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,289
like totally blocking it like hey that's

1219
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,270
not Michelle I don't know you're talking

1220
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:16,029
about and they quickly like let me into

1221
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:17,710
the venue and they blocked him and the

1222
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:20,710
security guard was saying yeah this guy

1223
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:23,920
showed up like he was here like six

1224
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:25,059
hours early and when you went in he

1225
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,480
started banging his head against the

1226
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:31,119
wall I was like dude this is crazy cuz

1227
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,170
I've been on hiatus for so long you know

1228
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,599
like it would make sense

1229
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:37,630
like you're active I was active and also

1230
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:39,609
I mean not to like you know not not to

1231
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,980
like shun anything or anything but it

1232
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:43,510
was more promiscuous to like if I'm

1233
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,799
showing more promiscuous photos of

1234
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,599
myself okay that makes more sense but

1235
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:48,790
you know like II go on my Instagram feed

1236
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:51,040
it's just my cat and me and like anime

1237
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:54,609
pictures and I'm so about even pictures

1238
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:58,150
of you yeah dude this is crazy so I

1239
00:46:54,609 --> 00:47:00,849
can't even imagine other people who have

1240
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:02,890
a following built on you know their

1241
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:03,910
sexuality and all of that but yeah dude

1242
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:07,299
there's like crazy people

1243
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:11,740
I'm sure he's not crazy but you just

1244
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:13,480
don't do that yeah I mean at that point

1245
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:16,690
that's not even like a hardcore fan

1246
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:19,510
that's like even fans I think having of

1247
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:20,410
awareness to not show up and I don't

1248
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,730
know I don't know if you added in the

1249
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,680
whole scratching thing on purpose but

1250
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,510
that sounds I could I don't know I could

1251
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,670
be wrong I'm just judging right now no

1252
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:30,160
idea this guy's like you just you just

1253
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:32,079
don't do that like have some just have

1254
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,150
some respect for people's spaces and I

1255
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,280
and I feel like a lot of a lot of

1256
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,589
viewers they they almost feel entitled

1257
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,720
when they see online personalities like

1258
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,200
oh I know them because they're my best

1259
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,849
friend

1260
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,190
and so they've I've heard horror stories

1261
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:47,170
of youtubers where they would have

1262
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:49,150
people like outside their block like

1263
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:50,920
taking pictures of their house because

1264
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,839
they saw maybe on their GPS like where

1265
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,809
they were going right that's why I moved

1266
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:57,400
and it still happens yeah I moved

1267
00:47:55,809 --> 00:48:01,030
because I was not in a gated community

1268
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:03,220
and I have camera I still have footage

1269
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:05,020
of people like kids coming to my house

1270
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,730
and like taking pictures like through

1271
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:08,079
the windows and stuff obviously I was

1272
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:10,930
already paranoid by then so all the

1273
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,970
things they could never see me but yeah

1274
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,890
there's that happens all the time I mean

1275
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,049
David had scarier story like your story

1276
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:19,150
about your stalker dude yeah you and

1277
00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:21,339
kina and kina we had a his mascara

1278
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,400
shared stalker why don't you share that

1279
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:26,200
story you never talked about that sure

1280
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,030
I'm pretty sure he's not watching but he

1281
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,920
might be go ahead

1282
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,980
but yeah so kina and I had this one

1283
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,530
stalker on Twitter and he would put out

1284
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,589
these like really mysterious like the

1285
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:40,809
deaths the day of death shall come upon

1286
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:42,730
keen like you tagged kina and I and you

1287
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:44,710
just like come up with a lot of these

1288
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:46,810
like creepy cryptic kind of

1289
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:47,980
suja's and I just didn't really think

1290
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,930
too much of it I was like oh this is

1291
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,099
whatever I don't even know where this

1292
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,010
guy is or who this guy is

1293
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:56,619
so eventually kena and I we both went on

1294
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:58,900
tours separate separate tours but at the

1295
00:48:56,619 --> 00:49:02,349
same time we were both on tour she plays

1296
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,880
at this venue in Florida and I was gonna

1297
00:49:02,349 --> 00:49:07,150
play at the same venue two weeks later

1298
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,710
so two weeks later hums by and I I roll

1299
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:12,609
up you know with my gear and everything

1300
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:15,099
and you know my crew and they were the

1301
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:16,599
crew there they were they were like hey

1302
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:18,880
David we heard that there's a stocker

1303
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:21,369
guy and you know we have a picture of

1304
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,040
him and we just wanted to let you know

1305
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:26,080
that we are we know what's going on and

1306
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,750
we'll keep an eye out for anything weird

1307
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:32,230
or sketchy that may happen okay cool

1308
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:35,349
awesome I'm in my green room getting

1309
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:38,380
ready for the show guy a security guard

1310
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:45,000
comes in he's like David he's like the

1311
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:48,550
guy showed up I was like what no way and

1312
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,740
they were like yeah he came in he had a

1313
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:53,980
fake ID

1314
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:58,690
he he he saw before before the tour

1315
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:00,820
actually kinas shared me a web site like

1316
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:03,369
and he had a mug shot he had like a

1317
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,720
little mustache so he when he came to

1318
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:08,830
the show he actually shaved off his

1319
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:18,160
mustache and he showed up and the great

1320
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:20,020
thing is he bought a t-shirt in a CD and

1321
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,970
then they saw him and they caught him I

1322
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:25,599
mean I'm glad they did after he bought

1323
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:32,619
the t-shirt and I would have signed it

1324
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:35,140
for him too so but he had a mug shot

1325
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:37,240
yeah so yeah and then and then they were

1326
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,460
like they escorted him out and that's it

1327
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,320
yeah I was like did you guys not call

1328
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,660
the police or anything yeah they're like

1329
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:46,630
I mean he didn't have anything wrong so

1330
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,790
we just identified him we escorted him

1331
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:51,730
out and then that's all we could do just

1332
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:53,560
not let him back in it was still kind of

1333
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:56,290
scary because he could have waited a

1334
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,970
block away with a gun and he could have

1335
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,619
shot me with that that's why when the

1336
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,079
whole Christine

1337
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:03,690
machining grimmy that really affected me

1338
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,490
a lot I stopped doing show not just for

1339
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:07,650
that reason but some of the main reasons

1340
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:09,450
I stopped doing I don't travel anymore I

1341
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:11,309
don't do those kind of shows because I

1342
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:13,829
don't know I just that that situation

1343
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:15,569
really like haunted me you know because

1344
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:18,599
it could it's if you think about it it's

1345
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:20,339
really easy to do like the security is

1346
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,990
there but it's like it's not hard to get

1347
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:23,910
things past people right it's not like

1348
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:26,579
we're going through actually I don't

1349
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:28,170
know how like ariana grande tours are

1350
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:30,480
like they have metal detectors and stuff

1351
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:34,279
but for our shows it was never like that

1352
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,839
crazy but it has to be now right yeah so

1353
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:37,650
anyway that's just I thought it was

1354
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:40,710
interesting because you brought up

1355
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:45,749
something soccer related yeah no dude I

1356
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:48,089
mean I think I think I do I feel like

1357
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:50,099
some people they fantasize about having

1358
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:50,970
a stalker you know what I mean like oh I

1359
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:53,039
want a stalker

1360
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:55,490
I think you think like people want to

1361
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:58,319
stock quarterly Fifty Shades of Grey if

1362
00:51:55,490 --> 00:52:00,900
I haven't seen it either but like I've

1363
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,789
read the wiki of it but I'm pretty sure

1364
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,980
of that Christian Grey guy or whatever

1365
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:07,049
his name is if he was a broke-ass guy

1366
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,849
like yeah it would not be a romantic

1367
00:52:07,049 --> 00:52:11,160
story but the fact that he's a CEO and

1368
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:13,230
super rich people fantasize that like

1369
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,569
yeah he's a stalker it's so hard like no

1370
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,309
that is not yeah I think you should not

1371
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:18,869
romanticize whatever you what if your

1372
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:22,140
stalker guy that show up to your office

1373
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:23,759
he was like gorgeous like just the

1374
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,559
best-looking dude looks clean his

1375
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:29,220
business suit you just I need to see

1376
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:31,349
Michelle I need to see a show and even

1377
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,480
his voice is just like do you fake real

1378
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:34,920
buzz would you have still send it okay

1379
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,220
thank you would you still have sent him

1380
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,680
away

1381
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,029
because it looks matter in that case

1382
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,739
because you're not gonna judge him in

1383
00:52:39,029 --> 00:52:42,450
the same way right even your co-workers

1384
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:44,509
you're right looks do you matter

1385
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,849
yeah if you don't have business with me

1386
00:52:44,509 --> 00:52:49,289
but even if he sure I've been a nice

1387
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:51,599
Burberry I was trying to go my expensive

1388
00:52:49,289 --> 00:52:53,190
brand I don't know Burberry suit that's

1389
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,650
an expensive one I feel like that would

1390
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:57,210
just be plaid like he's also came up

1391
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:58,589
okay but that's it happen and that was

1392
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,329
your stalker and you saw him in another

1393
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:02,059
event and he showed up it's a little

1394
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:04,680
weird but it's like this gorgeous dude

1395
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:06,480
expensive suit would you still have sent

1396
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,950
him away that's my question or would you

1397
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,180
have given him the benefit of the doubt

1398
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:11,620
and had a little talk with him

1399
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:14,590
would have seen just what is your

1400
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:16,300
business here oh really yeah the most

1401
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:20,640

00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:24,280
gorgeous persons like money man I got it

00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:29,500
questioning with you at least and since

1406
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:31,450
I've said three lines this whole podcast

1407
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,420
I figure I should pitch it to you

1408
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:39,550
go for it somebody asked so Michelle

1409
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:42,010

1410
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:44,200
talked a lot about what what was in the

1411
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,240
past sure yeah so you know we kind of

1412
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,680
want to see cuz you know you're like you

1413
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,000
said your channel is like you're

1414
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,460
starting to use it now there's music

1415
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,310
coming on so and you're like you said

1416
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,690
you and made an analogy where it's kind

1417
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:57,190
of like the beginning of a party people

1418
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:00,490
come to it you know so the party is

1419
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:02,920
starting up so you know how are you

1420
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:10,480
kicking off this party in and out truck

1421
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:12,670
coming in ten minutes I don't know I'm

1422
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,590
just I don't know I don't have a master

1423
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:15,970
plan I'm just really like you're doing

1424
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:20,320
what you're doing currently right with

1425
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:21,730
that but then you said you which I

1426
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:26,890
thought was interesting because like you

1427
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:29,410
said I'm an uber driver right and you

1428
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:32,350
know I have to show up and drive but you

1429
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:34,630
have created another uber but you want

1430
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:36,330
to go back to driving a little bit you
