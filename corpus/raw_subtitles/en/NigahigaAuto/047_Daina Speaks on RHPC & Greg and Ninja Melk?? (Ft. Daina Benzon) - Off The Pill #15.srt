Ella Skillshare class on how to open up

65
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:55,500
cans without white noise that's it that

66
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,109
would be a heart actually eating snacks

67
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,260
in class especially chance true always

68
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:01,859
caught Oh is there a way there is no any

69
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,079
nice crunch

70
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:06,810
no anyway you would have to like like

71
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,459
suck on the chip for a long time no but

72
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,650
even opening the bag oh yeah you can't

73
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,599
do that everyone had that scene in Big

74
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,769
Daddy mm-hmm and when he's like trying

75
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,599
to eat um well that's he trying to eat I

76
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,220
don't know some kind of chips but that's

77
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,829
such a relatable thing you can't open a

78
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,470
bag of chips without making a lot of

79
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,919
noise yeah whenever I do that instantly

80
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,660
wherever I am in the house dogs every

81
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,430
single time I remember in school

82
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,200
whenever I had to open up a bag of chips

83
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,690
I'd always just be like I'd have to

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:45,209
cough yeah because it was loud you know

85
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:47,160
so it Gregg does with farting and farts

86
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,129
at the same time huh yeah he does holes

87
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,840
yeah well he coughs loudly so you don't

88
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,629
hear his fart yeah but you can clearly

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,310
hear his part and a burp is like it's

90
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,310
extra long wait what do you mean

91
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,209
sometimes he'll do the Burt Burt the

92
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,230
barb the barb the but that's a good name

93
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:11,190
for it the barb the burp I was other one

94
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:14,040
cough combo that is that's a lot yeah

95
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,109
just died a lot of emotions going on

96
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,479
ones I've definitely farted and sneeze

97
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:22,229
at the same time I once threw up and

98
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,400
diarrhea at myself at the same time ha

99
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,640
so where did it go

100
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,180
yes because when I was a kid you know I

101
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,639
had the flu

102
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,889
uh-huh and so I just like spread my legs

103
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,080
open over the toilet and just like try

104
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:36,600
the puke through the hole didn't it yeah

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,949
I definitely got all over me oh yeah oh

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,270
yeah well that's just unfortunate where

107
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,530
else actually where else is gonna go

108
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,479
unless you have a trash can next to you

109
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,889
so what about you Dana since we have a

110
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,520
girl in the room today and we're

111
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:52,830
starting off with very hot oh how should

112
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,410
I say manly topics is that sexist to say

113
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:59,160
no most girls don't let's see not that

114
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,240
easy huh yeah how about what this what

115
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,150
are your thoughts on girls are like

116
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,520
girls no Boop well I mean that's I don't

117
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,010
know I don't think that's a know that it

118
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,810
is girl I mean it's a joke yeah it is

119
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,130
but a lot of girls like don't you talk

120
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,520
about they're poop-shaped

121
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:18,900
yeah those are poop shamed I agree yeah

122
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,150
but you agreed that girls don't poop are

123
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,550
you agree that it's a common joke yeah I

124
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,650
think but I think some girls take it too

125
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,300
far you know where they're actually like

126
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,820
I don't want to talk about this great I

127
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,130
don't poop you know we should start it

128
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,260
your movement I mean I there was that

129
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,419
video I gave you about how girls should

130
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,139
be like allowed to fart hashtag me poop

131
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:43,530
yeah and then bite what you're gonna get

132
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:46,320
you're gonna get you for that Bob no I

133
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,880
mean like Dana's pretty as much as Deena

134
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,210
is cuz you're always you're the only

135
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,630
girl in or hpc and you're around guys

136
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,949
all the time farting and burping and and

137
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,599
you're pretty open to it like you don't

138
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,810
think it's I mean whether you do or not

139
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:03,449
you're just around it right yeah yeah

140
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:08,990
you have a choice but even before rhpc

141
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:11,820
she's kind of been around all guys just

142
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,010
the dance crew all Steph boys like I was

143
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,349
always around like 15 to 17 guys all the

144
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:22,590
time so maybe I'm immune to it because

145
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:24,090
I'm maybe I guess oh no but you grew up

146
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,060
with all I mean not grew up but like all

147
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,889
your friend group was mostly guys um and

148
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,139
then now with rhpc you're surrounded by

149
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,760
guys all the time who are pretty gross I

150
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,330
would say I mean in compared to the

151
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,340
average yeah person I think very open

152
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,840
with farting and some but like being the

153
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,860
only girl you don't really like when

154
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,650
that stuff happens it's not

155
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:49,020
you go ill or like you're just so immune

156
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:50,940
to it but you yourself don't do it yet

157
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,220
so I think that's what we're talking

158
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,070
about like how it's not okay for girls

159
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,330
to express themselves that way I think

160
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,790
with us it's okay

161
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,920
what do you mean like with us like many

162
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,750
girls did that we'd be like no he's like

163
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,640
we would kind of encourage it yeah well

164
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,590
yeah I'd be like cuz it's you it's

165
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,590
different yeah would you do it with me

166
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,020
do what fart if you farted yeah I think

167
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,580
we would be all laughing we'd be like I

168
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,710
think we'd be grossed out I think we

169
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,600
need like yeah I think it depends on

170
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,150
your friend group I don't know okay so I

171
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,650
permission so if that happens actually

172
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,970
we encourage it not just permission we

173
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,620
want you to fire in front of us

174
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,020

00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,130
now

183
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,860
what if she farts she still is yes no

184
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,140
she still is embarrassed but like I mean

185
00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:03,830
I don't see why like I've heard her poop

186
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:07,320
before I've heard I've heard some salvos

187
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,420
I'm sure Greg actually has Greg hurt I'm

188
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,790
sure he's heard you fought oh yeah do

189
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,230
you do it like no not on right so I

190
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,700
think similar to that cuz you I mean you

191
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,060
guys are basically like how long have

192
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:22,860
you and Greg been together it'll be

193
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:27,650
maybe 15 years holy moly older than a

194
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:31,230
lot of that's like people watching yeah

195
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:33,320
more than half our life they've been

196
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,510
together since high school right yeah

197
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,790
lasted my last year of high school right

198
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,020
that is uh you're basically married in

199
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,660
some states I think yeah common law

200
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,140
common law

201
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:49,320
well um speaking of Greg what is it like

202
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,150
living with Greg that's a common thing

203
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,730
that I mean not just I mean we don't

204
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,720
even know yeah oh yeah I mean you kind

205
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,939
of know you lived it

206
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,930
yeah but I mean like the it's it's an

207
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:59,160
interesting relationship cuz you guys

208
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,839
have been together so long you live

209
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,639
together but you also work together a

210
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,519
lot uh-huh we do everything together

211
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,470
it's good it's tricky but do you ever

212
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,519
get like man I just need my own space

213
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:16,500
oh all the time does he that's yeah well

214
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,569
that's why their house has like five

215
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,670
different rooms yeah yeah we each have

216
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:27,060
our own offices for when yep those times

217
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:29,790
happen because they do yeah I think what

218
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,319
helps is that like early on in our

219
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:36,509
relationship too after a few years of

220
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:38,519
dating we were like Co partnering a damn

221
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,500
studio we had the dance crew so we were

222
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,209
both kind of like in the creative

223
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,560
director position so we always worked

224
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,500
together and then we both taught

225
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,420
multiple dance classes together and I

226
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,949
feel like it we kind of got used to

227
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,350
doing everything together so we

228
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:54,509
understand each other's chemistry and

229
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,459
how we work right but with this line

230
00:09:54,509 --> 00:10:00,449
it's like with what we're doing now with

231
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:02,490
working with you and stuff it gets a

232
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:04,529
little tricky knowing the fact that it's

233
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,290
kind of like unpredictable of what you

234
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:09,240
throw at us basically and since we both

235
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,000
have different strengths and visions

236
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,309
that we could either show off we do tend

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,019
to bump heads a lot creatively and that

238
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:18,870
kind of affects the relationship because

239
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,879
if you have a tricky day where you want

240
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,870
something to happen your way and you

241
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,670
know he thinks otherwise

242
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,100
before compromising it's like you can't

243
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,959
go home and complain you're like let

244
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,870
yeah stress out on your boyfriend who

245
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:33,120
caused you the stress to begin with so

246
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,480
we don't have that but we do understand

247
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,180
that okay

248
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,399
we're compromising a little bit more

249
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,459
efficiently now where we both kind of

250
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:47,009
understand how to work around each other

251
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,750
and our visions but it's tricky but also

252
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,129
rewarding because it's when you know

253
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,290
when we come out with something that's

254
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:56,189
really cool that we both were a part of

255
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,540
we could say that we also did this while

256
00:10:56,189 --> 00:11:00,600
in a relationship or it's something that

257
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,189
we created together and that yeah that's

258
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,040
awesome I was wondering about that

259
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:07,259
because it's got to be like for you I

260
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,520
feel like it's tough because or maybe

261
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,410
weak there's a side that we don't

262
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,590
see but you're the temp person that I've

263
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,420
never once heard you mad really actually

264
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,460
I think a little annoyed but I've never

265
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,110
heard you complain or mad like I don't

266
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,550
know if you have no no I've never seen

267
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:25,830
her Greg get mad at her actually but

268
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,360
I've never seen like maybe when you guys

269
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,160
are home do you ever get like and show

270
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,260
that I'm sure you have to write every

271
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,840
normal person does that otherwise you're

272
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,000
a social path you know but you've never

273
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:41,700
when we're around you've never done that

274
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,820
yeah no I think it's hard did how do I

275
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,760
say this when I'm around you guys it's

276
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,440
like it's always a like a positive

277
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,900
environment so it's kind of hard if

278
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,930
something frustrates me like I won't let

279
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:59,910
it get to me right um I think a lot of

280
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,070
the time too is because your frustration

281
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,870
will probably happen before we even get

282
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,310
together because you're designing props

283
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,480
and you're designing costumes and you're

284
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,550
designing sets and that's something not

285
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,050
necessarily we're around and then as

286
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,400
soon as you're done being stressed out

287
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,960
that's when we all meet up and then

288
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,330
you're like I have nothing to be upset

289
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,940
about I've seen like moments were like

290
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,620
you know if I mean even if it is a

291
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,150
positive environment I mean there's it's

292
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,560
stressful situations we're running out

293
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,120
of sunlight or if like we've got to film

294
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,800
something in a limited amount of time

295
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,360
we're not moving fast enough you know

296
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,610
like there's there's definitely times

297
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,400
where everybody gets frustrated and I've

298
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,020
seen Greg get frustrated stressed and

299
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,020
you guys kind of whether it's like

300
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,650
something you disagree on and Greg get a

301
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:44,310
little upset but you won't you just kind

302
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:48,450
of go with the flow okay like very

303
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,190
passive mmm-hmm I think oh yeah when he

304
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:54,810
kind of gets in that position I know to

305
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:57,180
just kind of follow his word because I

306
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:01,280
trust that you know I don't I don't want

307
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:04,230
to confront him in that time or I think

308
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,820
he kind of gets into a director mode so

309
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,980
I'm like okay let me do this for you

310
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,110
because I think at that time when were

311
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,750
filming and it something like that

312
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:15,180
happens I just kind of trust him or I

313
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,680
just trust and that he knows what he's

314
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,200
gonna be doing and I'll help support

315
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,690
that because sometimes he'll be kind of

316
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,110
in a panic or trying to figure out what

317
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,690
he needs

318
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,610
you are kind of overwhelmed so then

319
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,769
that's when I become like what can I do

320
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:33,959
for you type thing because I know that

321
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:36,810
you know if it turns into something more

322
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,550
complicated than at home it'll be a

323
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,990
different story

324
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:47,550
right right with a real fighting

325
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:49,079
physical fight brings out the bat that's

326
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,720
why maybe that's why I'm reserved

327
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,230
because I know that hmm we'll figure it

328
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,810
out later

329
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,850
yeah not worth not worth bringing it

330
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,560
into the working environment because it

331
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,480
could bring everybody else down and true

332
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,519
that is true I can make things harder

333
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,930
mm-hmm okay

334
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,060
well that's just something I wondered

335
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,820
about yeah but we kind of jumped right

336
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,440
into it like we we went to what you do

337
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,930
like we need to get to know how they met

338
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,940

different back then he did and you're

look at that she's all giddy still she's

365
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,920
still got butterflies thinking about him

366
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,940
that's disgusting

367
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,520
Oh Gail stop um we met it was my first

368
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,150
year in high school and it was my first

369
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:38,460
homecoming and he was actually the blind

370
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,920
date of my best friend at the time so we

371
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,050
met we had our homecoming dinner at the

372
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,290
mall food court and then Greg shows up

373
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:49,200
and that's how we formally met and I

374
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,000
just remember during the dance like my

375
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,950
friend didn't want to dance with him

376
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,100
Greg was kind of a Wallflower that

377
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:59,190
entire night and he went to a different

378
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,950
high school the first two years before

379
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,480
he switched over to mine so he would

380
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,340
come to every dance like our friends

381
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,350
would take turns bidding him in you know

382
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,780
when you fill out an application for

383
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,120
someone from another school to attend

384
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,610
the dance right so he would always be

385
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,420
there and dance with him so I feel like

386
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:21,000
he I kind of wanted to talk to him more

387
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,790
and more and then after summer break

388
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,580
like he started attending school just

389
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:31,910
two years later though right here is

390
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:38,010
this yeah show your age real quick

391
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:42,270
graduated 15 years ago right yeah mm

392
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:44,610
four or five ish 2005 um so you

393
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,160
basically for for two years you're just

394
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,420
like man this is really weird guy that

395
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,030
just keeps hanging around our friends

396
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:57,300
but doesn't ever dance yeah and then you

397
00:16:51,030 --> 00:17:00,120
were attracted to that yeah all right

398
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,560
guys no you know it's a bag of Dana he's

399
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,440
just gotta be a you know hang around

400
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,170
don't really get involved be a

401
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,240
Wallflower but like every time every

402
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:12,690
time it would come around he would

403
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,670
always be like that silly guy and he had

404
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,830
an afro at the time which is hard to

405
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,830
believe now he had a big afro and he

406
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:22,650
would wear like ginormous hoop earrings

407
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:25,890
mismatched clothes like he was always so

408
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:28,320
quirky but he was super shy at the time

409
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,530
so I feel like that's what kind of made

410
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,960
me interested and I was like I was too

411
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,570
shy to ask him to dance but it was so

412
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,610
repetitive like they would bring him and

413
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:42,510
I always had that curiosity like I want

414
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:44,640
to get to know him more but he went to

415
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,230
our school and then started dancing in

416
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
our dance classes and then that

417
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,800
friendship builds because we always had

418
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,960
yo mutual friends and

419
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,190
and from there it kind of took off

420
00:17:51,960 --> 00:18:00,150
through dance and yeah just hanging out

421
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:01,740
who talked who hit up who first was it

422
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,720
ever like oh hey I think you're cute or

423
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:11,190
is it always just like just talking and

424
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:12,750
flirting and then yeah actually um it

425
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,750
was pretty random cuz we would hang out

426
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,560
and then all of a sudden he would kind

427
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,330
of send me little messages on MySpace

428
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,650
after school so that was a thing after

429
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:27,450
school you'd go home and check your

430
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:31,550
myspace and he would just be like hey I

431
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,550

432
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:39,950

433
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:43,950
yeah yeah but the thing was hey I

436
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,090

00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,340
outside of the group like a brother a

439
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,080
cousin yeah so I was so creepy in high

440
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:05,280

441
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,780

450
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,700
this psycho Dana yes I don't know if I

451
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,500
still have it it's probably deep in my

452
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:52,860
closet but that boy that I liked he

453
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:54,720
stepped on a plate but you said I don't

454
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,530
know if I still have it but that boy is

455
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,530
in my closet

456
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:05,260
here's some scary okay I'm sorry I

457
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:07,570
didn't mean to interrupt sorry data yeah

458
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,910
way cooler no go ahead

459
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,320
he like he stepped on a plate at lunch a

460
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,440
paper plate it was laying on the floor

461
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,950
and he left like a shoe print on it

462
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,870
and like right when he walked away I

463
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,490
took the plate and I was kind of joking

464
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,830
off to my friends because they knew that

465
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,350
we all kind of liked him he was he was a

466
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,180
cutie so I took the plate and I like put

467
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:32,050
clear tape on it to laminate it and

468
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:37,300
preserve it and I kept it I may have had

469
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:40,720
him sign it like I think they all kind

470
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:43,930
of knew that I was crushing pretty hard

471
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,490
right um and I think he knew it too so

472
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,650
it would kind of be more of a playful

473
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,800
thing like watch I'll do this type thing

474
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:55,090
that's so creepy it is but back then you

475
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,550
didn't think um so I did that and I

476
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,860
would like draw a cartoon version of him

477
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,660
on my planner but the thing was when I

478
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,630
started showing more interest in Greg

479
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:08,980
like I drew a doodle of Greg next to the

480
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:12,460
guy with afro and the hoop earrings and

481
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,440
I think Greg and I spend more time

482
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,190
together like in dance class that really

483
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,060
brought us together

484
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,980
and that's when things started like

485
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,570
actually happening I feel like with the

486
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,510
first guy was crushing out it was more

487
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,900
playful like trying to joke around cuz

488
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:32,110
he was super cute yeah Greg was always a

489
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:34,540
person that I was very interested in

490
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,230
he's such a unique character yeah we can

491
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,980
all agree on that

492
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,270
um I know someone I peaked on Twitter

493
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,800
and someone asked like what made you

494
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,480
fall in love with him and stuff and our

495
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:52,480
shadow think like on my drive here

496
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:54,550
stooping to the good-good when he went

497
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,820
to our school he was on like the

498
00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:00,190
audio/video audio/video audio/video team

499
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,720
and he would do the morning

500
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,360
announcements so he would read the lunch

501
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,160
the daily lunch that would be you know

502
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,230
on the TV they would roll they still had

503
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,400
the TVs that they would roll in play the

504
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,530
morning announcements he would read

505
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,390
lunch or any news and

506
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,860
but he had the afro and the big earrings

507
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,370
and like everybody saw him as this

508
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:20,700
character I was like oh he's so cool and

509
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:24,850
that's why that's when you fell in love

510
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,260
is that what you were saying you don't

511
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,570
know but that was like the moment you

512
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,910
just thought that was he was so cool

513
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:34,180
he's such a cool character yeah and I

514
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:37,060
think yeah yeah you can tell I I've

515
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,100
always been drawn to things that are

516
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,270
unique and I guess you can kind of tell

517
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,160
that yeah yeah

518
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,230
and then you yourself are very unique in

519
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,990
terms of how you would dress and like I

520
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,600
mean did that's what you take pride in

521
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:52,300
different and doing things differently

522
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:56,290
stalking people yeah did Greg know about

523
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:00,160
this like back then yeah he was aware of

524
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:02,680
it it sounds like a plot to an 80 summer

525
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,450
flick I don't know why yeah you see you

526
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,670
like we explained that story and then

527
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,290
making doodles of the guy you're like a

528
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,300
girl in an anime that's like the main

529
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:12,520
Kerala

530
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:14,290
with the bad character and was like

531
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,700
really handsome and then she ends up

532
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,250
falling in love with the guy who's like

533
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,020
the clown yeah the guy who would have

534
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,520
always have like the swirly eyes yeah

535
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,060
every time we see it's the true love

536
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,180
yeah I get beat up all downstairs while

537
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,890
you actually sick you saved you would

538
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,900
follow guys around that you liked and

539
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,540
then saved their footprints yeah

540
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,640
but the thing was I think everybody kind

541
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,110
of jokingly knew I was like that or I

542
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,500
kind of made that character for myself

543
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:45,670
I'm a joke yeah but I feel like Greg

544
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,080
kind of he made it seem like there was

545
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:49,930
no need for me to do that anymore

546
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,620
right because after we started like

547
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,220
talking like a couple months into our

548
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,070
relationship

549
00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:00,130
he went from having an afro to doing

550
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:02,320
like the rat tail things yeah so when he

551
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,040
asked me to homecoming or some other

552
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:08,290
dance

553
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:10,390
he had like a ring container thank what

554
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:13,150
do you call that a ring bell ring boxes

555
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:15,160
yeah yeah I don't know so he waited for

556
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,110
me at lunch and all of our friends were

557
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,780
there and he had this box and he

558
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:22,000
presented it to me and it was the lock

559
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:28,720
of his rat tail

560
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,190
I have to do anything for that I didn't

561
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,980
have to creep behind you it's scissors

562
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:37,630
or anything like that's mine and I have

563
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,560
like I have like three at least for

564
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,390
those of you that don't know what that

565
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,340
is that's when your hair is like what is

566
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,910
it like a single strand of mullet yeah

567
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,230
it it's a baby mullet or like a baby boy

568
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,780
a baby mullet

569
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:53,410
pretty much I used to have that he

570
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:55,540
didn't cut them off and you guys are

571
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,580
freaks you guys are pretty that's pretty

572
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:01,720
strange but it's like that's why it's

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,220
funny and unique yeah yeah you're funny

574
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,540

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:26,740
I'm sure there's people who can relate

583
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,690
those like very I mean it seems like

584
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,100
Anatomy right I don't know why I think

585
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,410
Adam a I'm just picturing you like a

586
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,450
girl literally fault like stalking

587
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,460
someone that they like but usually like

588
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,970
a anime thing cuz in an anime that's

589
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,650
cute

590
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,350
if you do that in like a lifetime story

591
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,480
it's it's a murderer it depends on what

592
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,430
platform you're in yeah in anime it's

593
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,650
like oh it's so funny it's cute and then

594
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:53,200
you know but in real life oh it happened

595
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:57,400
in real life yeah I'm glad your don't

596
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,720
agree yeah yeah okay I did not know that

597
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:03,580
to be honest yeah oh yeah and then um

598
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,520
informally you know we have a hunch that

599
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,440
you met someone before mm-hmm

600
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,010
because we went to the same elementary

601
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,430
school and middle school and I don't

602
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:17,200
know if you guys had like like rainy day

603
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:20,680
Fridays but you would have designated

604
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,470
days where mixed grades would come

605
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,390
together and the last two hours of the

606
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,800
school day you can go to a room that's

607
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,780
watching a movie or you can go into a

608
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,970
room that's all coloring or toys and

609
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,360
stuff like that I loved it it was so

610
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:35,710
much fun

611
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:39,130
high school in elementary school and

612
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:42,160
I remember going into the toy room and

613
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:45,000
just like a little a little 10 boy

614
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,290
asking to play with me and we we did the

615
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,030
you know what a marble run is is where

616
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:52,560
you build

617
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:55,960
yep-yep contraption you roll the marble

618
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,870
but we both remember playing with that

619
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,810
that was our go-to thing and I told him

620
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:05,050
like I remember specifically this one

621
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:07,780
time that I played with a little boy who

622
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:17,410
is tan yes are you all you remember

623
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:20,410
maybe a little bit of shadow already he

624
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:23,650
was born with a hairy kid yeah really I

625
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:26,380
did not know that yeah so we did that

626
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,510
and I feel like while we were talking it

627
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,430
was a random story but I want to say

628
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:34,450
that we both kind of got that feeling

629
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:35,860
that it was fate because I also had that

630
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,400
experience with another friend in

631
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:41,260
preschool and I never I have totally

632
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,010
forgot about it and I met up with a

633
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,960
friend near the end of high school and

634
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,600
we became best friends and then there

635
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,130
was this one time where we were talking

636
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,160
about do you remember playing with a

637
00:27:51,130 --> 00:28:00,250
girl in preschool like blocks and so a

638
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:01,930
similar story and a couple of months

639
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,790
later a couple weeks later he comes with

640
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:07,600
a picture of us playing on the floor

641
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:10,960
he's like this is yeah so it was weird

642
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,930
and it was a very similar feeling huh

643
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,380
yeah maybe you were just following him

644
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,380
this whole time

645
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,160
that's cool I mean that's classic

646
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,060
clothes do you remember anything from

647
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,060

or like being really annoyed with the

671
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:16,270

that when when there was a guy there

676
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,720

711
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:05,570
about as she's leaving dude Dana is a

712
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:08,139
stalker dude this is a creep bruh good

713
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,070
thing good thing Dana found Greg because

714
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:11,450
she might have been a murderer so you

715
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,279
could he probably would have murdered

716
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,349
Greg if Greg didn't like her and then

717
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,330
kill Brandon oh I think she would have

718
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:19,700
choked him with his own rat - I think

719
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,080
she would have just followed him Dana's

720
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,779

you know there's gonna be people who

827
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,740
don't like it like anybody like you just

828
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,420
like rep you know the Red Bull like I

829
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,980
like the taste of it but like initially

830
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,900
when I first drank it I wasn't a fan

831
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,610
I'll tell you what people are gonna say

832
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:46,050
about yours it's too sour milk is weird

833
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:48,180
doesn't taste like milk though the

834
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,380
closest thing in terms of the thing is

835
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,880
when you hear about it you probably

836
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,880
think oh that's gross an energy drink

837
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,190
like milk and it's white - right but

838
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,490
what I wanted I wanted it to be white I

839
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:01,380
wanted to be different and the the

840
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,000
inspiration was kind of like those like

841
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,020
I don't know what those things are

842
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,760
called like after you eat Korean

843
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,680

Nelly from Nelly which prop costume was

866
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,610
the most difficult to create proper

867
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,080
costume most difficult for people who

868
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,590
don't know Dana does all the costumes in

869
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:19,360
props props

870
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:21,610
yeah oh um the BJ light sticks oh yeah

871
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,830
so that ii BG a video the light sticks

872
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:26,890
that light up yeah those were good yeah

873
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:29,350
Danny Dana and made those that was a

874
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,870
process because well you texted me the

875
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:34,420
idea mhm mhm and they were all hand-cut

876
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:38,260
from acrylic like we got a special saw

877
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:40,930
for it and I had no idea how to operate

878
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:45,490
it and it was a very big learning curve

879
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:48,010
and I tried so many things like I put

880
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:50,770
the stick on the flashlight and you

881
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,570
wanted both silver and gold and I'm

882
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,660
trying to figure out how to color it how

883
00:37:52,570 --> 00:38:00,910
to do that yeah so the light sticks

884
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:04,390
ended up being clear but I spray-painted

885
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:09,190
them like half or six gold six silver

886
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:11,200
and I just didn't like the way it looked

887
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:14,740
you couldn't really see it glow as much

888
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:18,070
afterwards so the day before we sent you

889
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:20,430
to LA with them I had a big bottle of

890
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:23,500
nail polish remover and I was like hand

891
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:25,840
removing all of the spray paint out of

892
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,980
all the crevices and everything just

893
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,230
like undoing there was two days of work

894
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:34,420
and on top of that we were working on

895
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,450
the Star Wars video at the same time

896
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,160
because we we filmed that a few days and

897
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,460
then you had to leave to do the BGA

898
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:45,580
stuff so then we were like picking up

899
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:47,230
while you were away but I feel like the

900
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,640
fact that we were doing two projects at

901
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:52,060
once and it was a lot of back and forth

902
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,590
so that was the hardest problem and the

903
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,510
Star Wars one had a lot of costumes -

904
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:58,600
mm-hmm so I was just at all at the same

905
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:01,150
time but yeah difficult to wise that was

906
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,220
that's I mean it look legit thanks yeah

907
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:05,620
I mean that couldn't have been easy it's

908
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:09,640
hard - yeah cut a straight line from

909
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:11,650
acrylic yeah I think that was actual

910
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,450
like a blood sweat and tears project

911
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,760
because it was overwhelming we were

912
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:18,700
working on multiple videos at the time I

913
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:23,710
was trying to learn how to use this saw

914
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:25,300
and the acrylic it's kind of sharp so I

915
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,780
definitely got in

916
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:33,070
several times you actually got cut it's

917
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:34,600
got like sharp ends when you after you

918
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,920
pull it through there's a little chars

919
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,810
that come off or if you're trying to

920
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,940
like smoothing edges and you you catch a

921
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:42,880
little bit yeah

922
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:45,850
all right but it was fun I think I

923
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,130
really like learned or I felt

924
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,980
accomplished like I taught myself how to

925
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:53,170
do this actually why don't you talk up

926
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:56,110
talk about how also you kind of got into

927
00:39:53,170 --> 00:40:01,270
rhpc cuz that was like unexpected right

928
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:04,090
yep yeah okay more story time yeah fun

929
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:09,610
fact like I met you before Greg met you

930
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:15,370
II do you remember how we met is that is

931
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:18,160
the third grade dude you're the kid no

932
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:19,450
it was at your house right my house so

933
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,570
you were living in North Hollywood at

934
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,430
the time with Doc yep yep and well Dom

935
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,350
kind of grew up around my family a lot

936
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:28,930
so it was no surprise that he would

937
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:31,780
spend holidays at my parents house so

938
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:33,310
when he came back for Thanksgiving he

939
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,740
brought you along with him

940
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,630
so we met you at my parents house on

941
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,300
Thanksgiving no staying there hey you're

942
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:43,330

944
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,740
when agents of secret stuff came out too

945
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:52,570
so we spent Thanksgiving watching agent

946
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:54,490

947
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:57,880

living back at home we would have these

961
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:30,880
themed parties and for Thanksgiving we

962
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:33,160

00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,220
either draw a pilgrim or an Indian and

965
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,620
there was like two teams and we would

966
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,160
have a whole like Thanksgiving Olympics

967
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,920

00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:50,019
all on the pilgrim side me you and Dom

971
00:41:47,979 --> 00:41:52,779
so I had my costume others need to get

973
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:57,579
meeting you I was already dressing you

974
00:41:54,339 --> 00:42:01,809
yeah and that was and that's when we

975
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:04,359
first met yeah yeah but the actual thing

976
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:09,190
that brought it all together was if you

977
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:11,229
want to talk more about it because what

978
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,839
you actually design was amazing

979
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:16,119
which one the the cloud thing right oh

980
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,039
that's right so even before I moved out

981
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,329
here I was still doing stuff for you

982
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,999
guys cuz that's when you would got

983
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:23,890
brought Greg on yeah and I would come

984
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:25,509
out to visit him and it just so happened

985
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,309
to be like oh you're gonna be in town

986
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:30,099
you could help us with his stuff so I

987
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:32,799
was visiting with some friends and I

988
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:36,549
helped you guys make a cloud video for

989
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:38,619
the 10-million the lamp clouds mm-hmm

990
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:40,660
that was a lot of fun so I helped out

991
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:44,259
with that for that week and then I went

992
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:46,359
home and then I came back a second time

993
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:47,849
and that's when we did the tea time room

994
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:51,190
mm-hmm

995
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:52,749
well originally because I mean people

996
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:56,140
don't know I'm sure that you went to

997
00:42:52,749 --> 00:42:58,029
college for interior design yeah and I

998
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,339
mean even when you first came out here

999
00:42:58,029 --> 00:43:01,839
it wasn't from my impression I I just

1000
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:03,819
thought you were you're coming here to

1001
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,529
do that it was this was gonna be like a

1002
00:43:03,819 --> 00:43:07,599
short term like oh so you don't have

1003
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:10,029
anything else yeah you want to just come

1004
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,450
help us out you know just kind of casual

1005
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:16,749
yeah and then I just found like wow this

1006
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:20,440
is like so much so much value in terms

1007
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:21,999
of what you can do it's so little yeah I

1008
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,549
think that's your gift in terms of like

1009
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:27,670
it's it's very difficult to be creative

1010
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:29,140
with not much and ain't even Greg to

1011
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,450
like both of you are very similar in

1012
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,910
that you can make something pretty legit

1013
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:35,170
with not much mm-hm and that's big for

1014
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,930
me because it saves me a lot of money so

1015
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:39,670
I'm gonna buy the real like I don't

1016
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,769
gonna buy actual clothes sticks okay hey

1017
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,299
Dana do you think and the thing is I'll

1018
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:45,940
always be like do you think you guys

1019
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:48,400
could make this and I've never heard no

1020
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,769
yeah like it's always like what okay

1021
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,990
like even if it's really difficult and

1022
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:55,720
then Greg will be like yeah I think Dan

1023
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:57,220
I think we'll figure it out yeah but

1024
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,550
it's never like no even though it should

1025
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:03,099
sometimes probably be a no really yeah

1026
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,750
like uh if when you're like oh can you

1027
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,859
help if I have to help them with props

1028
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,660
when you asked me to help them I know

1029
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:08,680
it's like a bigger project sometimes

1030
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,390
I'll go over there and I'll start

1031
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,520
helping them I'm like how are they doing

1032
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:14,830
this and they're like yeah we should

1033
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,770
have said no it's like going at it

1034
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:20,940
they're so creative it's crazy like

1035
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:24,490
you're the epic snort snort epic snort

1036
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,869
no video like you called me and you

1037
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:29,530
talked to me about it and you wanted

1038
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:32,619
like this frozen castle and multi-levels

1039
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:34,300
and stuff and greg was editing another

1040
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:37,390
video at the time but I had you on

1041
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:41,589
speakerphone and I hung up and Greg and

1042
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:43,390
I looked at each other I know I need I

1043
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:46,060
need people to do listen tell me no

1044
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:48,010
because I go to big things we do it I

1045
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:50,170
think that's almost fun in the

1046
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,430
Challenger you know we make something

1047
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:55,000
work it might not always be

1048
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:58,570
three-dimensional I guess it gets to a

1049
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,760
certain degree yeah yeah but it's part

1050
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,859
of the fun yeah I mean it's it's

1051
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,109
definitely it's definitely I know

1052
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:06,790
sometimes I'm just asking but like I

1053
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:09,070
already know you're just you're not

1054
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:11,140
gonna say no sometimes I tell great to

1055
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:14,530
like just tell me this is not realistic

1056
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:16,990
I can dumb it down more but Ryan's like

1057
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,369
that really pretty girl it like you know

1058
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:21,040
and then you guys are like the boyfriend

1059
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:22,869
and Ron's like can I have this and then

1060
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,160
you even though he knows like he

1061
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:26,470
shouldn't be getting it you guys like

1062
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,440
you know anything for you babe it's like

1063
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:31,359
that's oh no I'm going with this analogy

1064
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,220
all right I'm just saying they're

1065
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:36,550
they'll do anything for you because they

1066
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:38,619
appreciate you so much mmm that's some

1067
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:40,480
way you've found a way to make that but

1068
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:49,810
not that's not if I was dating you I'd

1069
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:51,400
say no find a much better guy so what

1070
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:53,260
when you first were bringing her on you

1071
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,530
thought a short term what you hated long

1072
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,880
term um yeah what just kept like she

1073
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,320
just kept help at first she was just

1074
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,260
helping for free like she was just like

1075
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,640
oh I I'm I'm sure Dana will help make

1076
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,890
that it was always just like Dan just

1077
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,819
helping and then we were like okay well

1078
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:10,029
if she's gonna be

1079
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:11,799
doing this you know delicious bring her

1080
00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:13,029
on for a little bit because at the time

1081
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:14,919
I was still thinking you were still

1082
00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:17,979
looking for that you know interior

1083
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:20,309
design kind of job I don't even know one

1084
00:46:17,979 --> 00:46:23,319
of those like shows like those problems

1085
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:25,119
well yeah well I have my bachelor's in

1086
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:26,829
interior design and my concentration in

1087
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,299
interior architecture so I did it all

1088
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:32,589
you know like the Cod and the model

1089
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:35,679
making and stuff but I feel like what

1090
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:37,419
I'm doing for you now or the more

1091
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,339
hands-on stuff is kind of more relatable

1092
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:43,539
to what I was working on when I was at

1093
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:47,380
home because my previous job was like

1094
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:49,419
more civil stuff and it kind of became

1095
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,910
into something that I haven't tapped

1096
00:46:49,419 --> 00:46:56,380
into and it I had no intention of going

1097
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:58,479
further in that but with what we're

1098
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,449
doing I use a lot of my model making

1099
00:46:58,479 --> 00:47:03,640
skills and you know learning what

1100
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:05,919
materials to use and what works as well

1101
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,589
as aesthetics and making sure things

1102
00:47:05,919 --> 00:47:11,979
look cohesive and all the little crafty

1103
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:14,679
tedious things basically right but yeah

1104
00:47:11,979 --> 00:47:16,689
when I came out here it was fun helping

1105
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:18,459
you guys and I did have a couple clients

1106
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:19,749
from back home that I was doing like a

1107
00:47:18,459 --> 00:47:22,089
broad staff for us I would send them

1108
00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:24,279
like CAD sketches and stuff and then I

1109
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:26,739
did a couple of jobs for interior design

1110
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:29,499
out here for my previous job yeah that's

1111
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:31,809
literally what your expertise is mm-hmm

1112
00:47:29,499 --> 00:47:33,369
because she designed the for people who

1113
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:36,279
watched second channel the tea time room

1114
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:38,380
and that was like I mean we I wasn't

1115
00:47:36,279 --> 00:47:41,439
expecting that like something so

1116
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:44,499
professional but I mean that's it was

1117
00:47:41,439 --> 00:47:46,269
around that time I would say yeah all

1118
00:47:44,499 --> 00:47:48,849
this - with Sean we actually have a

1119
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:51,099
video of that was supposed to go of the

1120
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:53,019
making of this room I don't know where

1121
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:59,140
that video is I think it's going Sean's

1122
00:47:53,019 --> 00:48:02,079
computer somewhere somewhere yeah

1123
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,749
there's there's a video of them making

1124
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:08,229
this room yeah and you helped there was

1125
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:11,229
a segment where I guess you can't see it

1126
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:14,439
now but the the Rhino that's above you

1127
00:48:11,229 --> 00:48:17,589
you helped me I did it was part of the

1128
00:48:14,439 --> 00:48:19,640
video yeah it never came out it's still

1129
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:21,410
one day it might one day

1130
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,080
there's a lot of videos that are like

1131
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:25,910
one day one day there's some videos

1132
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,430
though that that haven't we I haven't

1133
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:30,890
posted that I know it'll be the right

1134
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:35,950
time it just used to marinate like fan

1135
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:38,600
ball has to marinate I'm telling you

1136
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:45,500
don't just trust me dude I know these

1137
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:46,610
don't work work a Dana so I mean we kind

1138
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,440
of already discuss some other things

1139
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:52,850
like how you and Greg fell in love and

1140
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:55,700
stuff boring and also you know like the

1141
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:59,420
props that you guys made boring um and

1142
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:01,310
then I guess he stopped insulting her so

1143
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,750
much people already think you hate her

1144
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,820
like a lot of people from the other

1145
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:07,790
videos thing you know say oh yeah you're

1146
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:09,590
here to defend your side here and yeah

1147
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:13,940
you can let's talk about that how paco

1148
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:16,010
is like really mean to you i know in a

1149
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,230
joking way but sometimes it's like even

1150
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:20,030
for us were like cringing oh yeah i mean

1151
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:23,680
to everybody you are but it's a

1152
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:26,510
different amount but we're sexist we

1153
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,580
here's a least sexist because you treat

1154
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:31,340
Dana how you treat us exactly all

1155
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:33,200
feminists yeah I get opportunity disses

1156
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,200
coming all around your but some things

1157
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,000
you say to her you can't get away with

1158
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,310
oh sorry I didn't mean to interrupt

1159
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,790
talk about your side of the story I

1160
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:46,400
guess Paco is a feminist and I was I'm a

1161
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:50,660
three at best tell him tell him what he

1162
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,550
said we to update people yeah I've been

1163
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:55,280
wanting to explain my side of the story

1164
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:58,280
because when talk were told that story

1165
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:02,060
about how one of our friends asked

1166
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:05,270
Monica if she's on the team or not or if

1167
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:07,160
she's yeah with us and you said what did

1168
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:09,170
she say like she's too good-looking

1169
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:13,640
like she's Monica's too good-looking to

1170
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:16,160
be see and you said that I said but it

1171
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,660
was actually well that's a story she'll

1172
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,510
be about better context basically we

1173
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:22,610
were like oh yeah what is Monica in the

1174
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,650
group and I was like what no Monica

1175
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:27,260
stood up to attracted to be in the group

1176
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:30,080
and then someone is like what about Dana

1177
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:32,060
and I forgot that like you know Dana's

1178
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,620
like part of it but you just got to

1179
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,520
commit to the joke

1180
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:44,680
like what Dana's like a three at best

1181
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:44,680
and then I said afford okay way better

1182
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:51,080
now you defend yourself

1183
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:52,520
so it was Monica that said after you

1184
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,160
said she's sooo good looking to be in

1185
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,290
the group Monica goes oh so it was

1186
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,020
Monica that said that and then I went

1187
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:06,800
yeah yeah you're right

1188
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:08,840
she just wanted to clarify but it's even

1189
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,350
more sad because she's just like she's

1190
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:16,360
not like offended she's just like yeah

1191
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:18,500
that's even more offensive you hurt her

1192
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,570
you don't you don't care about that

1193
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,130
stuff but it's just like the way that I

1194
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:24,290
don't know this is some things you don't

1195
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:25,820
I don't know maybe I am a sexist person

1196
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,440
I'd I don't treat girls the same way I

1197
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:30,230
wouldn't say that to a girl I think

1198
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:34,850
friends to like self-deprecation is like

1199
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:38,120
our security blaze automatically it's

1200
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:40,130
more of like a light-hearted thing I

1201
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,630
don't know if I would say it to anyone

1202
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,730
in the group oh you're like a three at

1203
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,930
best maybe only you actually because you

1204
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,270
would say that to me yeah I don't said

1205
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:49,160
to Greg or will or any of them that's

1206
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,020
also be up for me I think I'm in a

1207
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,310
position that I can say that you say

1208
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,530
messed up things all the time yeah

1209
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:56,660
because you guys like do mess up things

1210
00:51:54,530 --> 00:52:01,310
to me so this is our dynamic what are

1211
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:06,260
you talking about are you talking I

1212
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:07,730
don't I don't yeah I don't know we don't

1213
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:13,940
say those kind of things to you you

1214
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:15,380
don't we give you helpful advice but

1215
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,660
that's because that's just how we talk

1216
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,130
there's example the relationship is Dana

1217
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:22,450
I don't talk like that to Dana

1218
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:24,260
but Greg really or any of us just you

1219
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,730
that's okay that's what makes you

1220
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,620
interesting all right let's just do it

1221
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:29,900
one last I mean the only really good

1222
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,580
question that's left is like what would

1223
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:35,960
you be doing if you weren't working with

1224
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:37,130
rhpc we just talked about what you went

1225
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,730
into and then how she got that what

1226
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:42,680
would you be doing oh that's true um

1227
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:44,810
well it's not like I don't have time I I

1228
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:47,330
would like to do something fun on the

1229
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:48,890
side too cuz there are times where

1230
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,980
you know you're writing Gregg's editing

1231
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:53,180
all the graphics and thumbnails are made

1232
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,310

1237
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:09,020
fun something artistic that I can

1251
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:40,400
start a patreon okay and then you know

1252
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:43,220
different tiers and then people can

1253
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:48,560
order your stuff hmm should I start one

1254
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:57,260
know when I fire me again thank you sure

1255
00:53:48,560 --> 00:54:00,650
we're still here I've always wanted to

1256
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:02,420
do I mean I have no artistic side but I

1257
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:04,340
always want to make the jokes cuz I used

1258
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:06,050
to like reading the the comedic ones

1259
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,970
like you know there's so many of them

1260
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:10,010
that are just like lame puns yeah I'll

1261
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:12,340
be great at Liam policy very close but

1262
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:16,370
then but then I couldn't do the art

1263
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:18,530
because it's poorly draw you have the

1264
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:20,840
puns and you attempt to doodle it it's

1265
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:23,060
much more entertaining looking at your

1266
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:26,690
stuff than like looking at one of ours

1267
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:28,630
and having it look good oh yeah I agree

1268
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:31,400
him have some house do the art because

1269
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:32,900
even with manga like the people that

1270
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,240
will write or have ideas they aren't

1271
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,830
necessarily always the artists right so

1272
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,750
you know where she's making a joke that

1273
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:42,500
it would look like a little kid drew

1274
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:43,790
yeah that's how I you I love that you

1275
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,650
love it cuz you're good at drawing the

1276
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:48,440
rest of us normal people you can't draw

1277
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:50,210
or like people don't stalk yeah this is

1278
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,030
crap like the thing that you made for

1279
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:55,310
