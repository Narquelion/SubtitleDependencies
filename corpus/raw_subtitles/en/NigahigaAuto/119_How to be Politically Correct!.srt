over-exaggerating may becomes it to be

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,069
extremely offensive to a certain person

4
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,210

5
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,529

it I mean I've taken all the classes on

17
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,780

20
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,489
class on the subject collating news

21
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,170
articles that other people write to tell

22
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,780
me how I should feel about controversial

23
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,309
topics 205 with my vast knowledge on

24
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,719
this subject I'm gonna be teaching you

25
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:51,530
how to be the most politically correct

26
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:53,699
you've ever been it was offending me

27
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,020
welcome to how to be politically correct

28
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,270
so those of you who don't know what that

29
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,620
means being politically correct or PC

30
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,969
basically means to avoid offending

31
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,100
people because we all know that

32
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,600
offending someone's feelings - the worst

33
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,489
thing a human being can do so let's get

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,439
started the first lesson in being PC is

35
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,299
to avoid the trendy topic if an issue is

36
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,530
trending on social media or talked about

37
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,270
on the news chances are you should

38
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,040
probably avoid that topic because all of

39
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,600
a sudden everybody really cares about it

40
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,830
now and no matter which side you pick

41
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,420
her probably gonna offend someone here's

42
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,640
an example of a trendy controversial

43
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,259
topic net you guys buy remember can you

44
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,630
believe this what this is Starbucks

45
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,520
Christmas cup so so there's no Christmas

46
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,259
on the cop this is a blatant attack on

47
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,420
my religion a blatant attack on

48
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,220
Christianity plus the cup is red that's

49
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,650
the same color as hell and the devil and

50
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,090
fire and pimples that are not ready to

51
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,229
be popped yet well I think they're right

52
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,610
for not putting Christmas on the clubs

53
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,079
did you just say well I'm not a

54
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,950
Christian and if they did have Christmas

55
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,299
designs on the cup then that's

56
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,040
infringing on my First Amendment right

57
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:56,159
of freedom of religion how dare you see

58
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:58,380
something just a cup see it might seem

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,729
like a silly petty argument but since it

60
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,259
was trending in the news it's really

61
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,329
important now if you really want to be

62
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,910
PC avoid the trendy topics this is what

63
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,330
he should have said guys it's just uh

64
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,730
never mind

65
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,810
no comment

66
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,000
you know what you're worse than both of

67
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:19,320
us by keeping quiet you're not doing

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,150
anything so the next lesson in being PC

69
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,320
is no more jokes jokes are a thing of

70
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,050
the past I mean you might think that

71
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,420
some jokes are not that bad but in 2017

72
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,860

73
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,800

78
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,590

82
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,530
of your little joke it fine it doesn't

83
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,800

84
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,560

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,209
the middle of the day right the middle

of the day Wow what is it now oh you're

bunch of misogynist hey why did the duck

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,620
cross the road why to prove you wasn't

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,090
chicken are you implying that all

91
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,400
chickens are cowards or that somehow

92
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,720
Ducks are above chickens in some way why

93
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,310
because ducks and chickens are equal

94
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,020
okay and people like you were support

95
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,580
ducks supremacy are part of the problem

96
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,440
what are you talking about I don't see

97
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,519
how this is offensive yeah of course you

98
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,110
don't you don't see it because you're a

99
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,760
little privileged duck boy I grew up in

100
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,900
the safety of your little ranch so of

101
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,299
course you're not afraid chickens

102
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,310
chickens we grew up in fear we get drugs

103
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,390
GMOs forced him to us at the mills were

104
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,130
forced to watch each other get

105
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,230
slaughtered just for food it ducks get

106
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,850
eaten - yeah they do but tell me how

107
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,709
often do you come across duck eggs at

108
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,900
the supermarket huh how often do you

109
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,670
pass by a fast-food chain called KFD you

110
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,120
see all bird lives do matter but right

111
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,220
now

112
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,840
chicken lives those are the lives that

113
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,910
are in danger and that's what's trending

114
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,590
what do you call someone with no cell

115
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,060
phone I don't know what a houseful

116
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,910
because with no cell phone you got a

117
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,769
closet with a household as somebody who

118
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,510
finds Jonah Hill on my casseras comedy

119
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,070
inappropriate I take offense to that

120
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,570
joke what they've never even said this

121
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,540
joke how is this even related to either

122
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,820
of them because it was super bad and

123
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,709
finally the last lesson in being PC is

124
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,090
for you to know that everything is

125
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,380
offensive if you don't think that

126
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,579
something is offensive chances are

127
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,930
you're a bad person and you're not

128
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,920
looking hard enough here let me make it

129
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,660
easy for you I'll give you some examples

130
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,040
now take a look at this x-men poster

131
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,870
does it offend you at all because if it

132
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,610
doesn't you hate women it's clearly

133
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,959
showing a man choking a woman's that

134
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,370
means you think that it's okay for men

135
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,620
to choke women not to mention at the top

136
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,660
of the Billboard it says only the strong

137
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,160
survive implying that men are stronger

138
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,840
than women but that's not it this poster

139
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,430
isn't just sexist it's racist I mean why

140
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,960
is the light-skinned blue person talking

141
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,310
the dark-skinned blue person and not the

142
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,780
other way around take a look at the date

143
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,430
on the bottom don't tell me it's just a

144
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,830
coincidence that they conspired the

145
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,780
release date to be on May 27th the exact

146
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,470
same day the race riots in East Saint

147
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,330
Louis took place in 1917 and the title

148
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,070
itself is not just sexist it's a hate

149
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,500
crime I mean the title of the franchise

150
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,660
is X Men Y not X women I'll tell you why

151
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,880
because x-men apocalypse is an attack on

152
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,220
the LGBT community that's right x-men

153
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,539
stands for transgender their x-men they

154
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,979
used to be men other women so they're

155
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,210
x-men so when they say x-men apocalypse

156
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,530
what they're really trying to say is

157
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,360
that this is the end of the world for

158
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,520
the transgender community I will not

159
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,760
stand for that I will remain sitting I

160
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,500
will not this is old news it's not

161
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,389
trending anymore it's no big deal then

162
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,530
next so in closing I know there's a lot

163
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,000
of things to remember so I'm gonna

164
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,889
simplify it and try and wrap everything

165
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,660
up in order to be a truly politically

166
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,160
correct person avoid all the trendy

167
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,840
controversial topics which basically

168
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,490
means that if something is being talked

169
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,199
about by somebody somewhere about

170
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,820
something you may not have an opinion

171
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,320
about it because you're wrong and it's

172
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,150
gonna offend someone must also remember

173
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,570
no more jokes jokes are a thing of the

174
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,190
past

175
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,870
so remember to never laugh or make

176
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,860
anyone else laugh because if you do that

177
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,500
means you're laughing at the issue

178
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,270
issues like war and rape and racism so

179
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,830
if you laugh you're a racist war rapists

180
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,139
and last but not least and most

181
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,940
importantly everything is offensive it's

182
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,560
not rocket science if you don't want to

183
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,210
