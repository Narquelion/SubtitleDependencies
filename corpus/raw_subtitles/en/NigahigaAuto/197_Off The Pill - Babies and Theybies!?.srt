1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
hey guys so I know for a lot of you the

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,980
title is probably a little confusing

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,960
because it's you know off the pill and

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,690
babies well it has nothing to do with

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,429
actually being off like a pregnancy pill

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,929
this is a really unfortunate coincidence

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,490
off the pill has a series of brands I

8
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,929
used to do like a long time ago some of

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,340
you guys might remember but I know that

10
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,350
there's a lot of you who are a little

11
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,270
newer and probably don't know what this

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,859
is because I haven't done this in like I

13
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,939
don't know over five years so basically

14
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,039
for those that don't know the off the

15
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,720
pill name came from the idea that those

16
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,670
were the days that I didn't take my ADHD

17
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,769
medication and basically I would just

18
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,820
rant about any random thing that came to

19
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,739
my mind although sometimes they're a

20
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,540
little too random where I would like go

21
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,190
a little too off-topic or I would just

22
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,780
cut away to these random skits or jokes

23
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,129
and usually it was just a really bad pun

24
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,079
so bad to the point where I had to

25
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,430
explain it that's what he said see what

26
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,829
I did there that's right it's gonna be

27
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,450
even better see what I did there

28
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,039
that was smashing but yeah that's why I

29
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,110
like this series because I could just be

30
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,489
me speaking my mind not sure other

31
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,809
people liked it as much as I did but

32
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,280
anyway the reason why I stopped doing

33
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,230
this series in these types of videos and

34
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,840
stuck more with you know scripted skits

35
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:09,330
and stuff was because well I I was a

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,299
huge coward because you know move

37
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,270
because like cows' words are like Moo

38
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,560
select coward sorry because sometimes

39
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,540
when I would do these videos and I was

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,040
just like freestyling I would say some

41
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,509
things that we're not too well thought

42
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,430
out I mean they were my honest opinions

43
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,290
but sometimes well a lot of times

44
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,150
they're very unpopular ones and honestly

45
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,320
I just got scared of making them as you

46
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,820
know people got more and more

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,619
politically correct I just don't want to

48
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,210
offend anyone well not anymore bring

49
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,829
them back because I'm smarter now I'm

50
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,720
better now I've evolved okay I'm no

51
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,579
longer some little timid Caterpie hiding

52
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,350
in his little Metapod I'm Butterfree now

53
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,000
sorry guys I also used to make a lot of

54
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,670
Pokemon references back then when it was

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,290
a little more relevant but honestly I

56
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,820
don't think people really appreciated

57
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,500
them anyway as I was saying before I

58
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,090
went completely off-topic as usual I'm

59
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,710
no longer afraid to do this series

60
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,540
anymore because I think I really have

61
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,219
gotten smarter you know I'm not gonna

62
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,869
say things that are just gonna offend

63
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,329
people I know how to give an opinion now

64
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,790
being a little bit more PC and most of

65
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,530
all I just know how to not

66
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,270
the majority of the masses by giving a

67
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,090
controversial opinion on something that

68
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,920
I really I hate babies okay there you

69
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,830
got it out of me okay obviously that's

70
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,810
an exaggeration I don't hate babies that

71
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,730
much I know I know it's like what Ryan's

72
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,260
baby hater okay you eat a baby you can't

73
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,880
believe your baby ain't looking you eat

74
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,830
a baby there so either see where all of

75
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,030
our hands up like this when we talk well

76
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,260
just scare me out real quick and this

77
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,060
isn't quite what I wanted to talk about

78
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,740
in this video but I just have to say

79
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,970
this babies are stereotypically one of

80
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,110
the most innocent things in the world

81
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,310
like if you were to make a list of the

82
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,990
most innocent things in the world it'd

83
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,710
probably be like babies and then like

84
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:39,320
puppies and trees puppies first babies

85
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,150
trees trees and because they're so

86
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,470
innocent it's really hard to be critical

87
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,910
of them but if you really break it down

88
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,140
and you really think about it babies

89
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,430
they they freaking suck figuratively and

90
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,170
literally like for one I'm not that very

91
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,850
old age right now where a bunch of my

92
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,350
friends and my classmates and peers

93
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,940
around my age are starting to have kids

94
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,590
and they'll go on their social media and

95
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,120
they'll post like these pictures of

96
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,920
their newborn babies like I'm talking

97
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,540
like right after their birth and right

98
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,170
like a caption like oh my gosh she's so

99
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,940
beautiful

100
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,970
oh he's changed my life for the better

101
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,220
you such a cute baby uh I sound like an

102
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,840
ass right now but almost at the point

103
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,730
hear me help everybody in the comments

104
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,470
are like Oh Congrats she's so beautiful

105
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,040
oMG she's so beautiful grats he's

106
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,510
adorable Oh cute so cute so coyote and

107
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,670
yes I'm not saying the babies aren't

108
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,050
cute I think a lot of babies not all but

109
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,790
I think a lot of babies are cute but you

110
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,580
guys I can't be the only one that thinks

111
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,380
that newborn babies are a little gross

112
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,230
looking they're all red and wrinkly

113
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,700
beady eyes gunk all over them yep and

114
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,680
now you can see why I stopped making

115
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,150
this series I mean this wasn't even the

116
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,620
point I want to talk about in this video

117
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,730
let's just get to that all right the

118
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,680
whole reason why I even started thinking

119
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,690
about babies is because last week I came

120
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,010
across this video about this new

121
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,739
movement I don't know if you guys heard

122
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,959
about it it's called babies babies

123
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,070
babies babies babies I don't know how

124
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,690
they pronounce it sounds more like a

125
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,070
disease to me than a movement whoo he's

126
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,480
got the babies and basically if you

127
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,310
haven't heard about this movement early

128
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,110
parents are starting to raise their kids

129
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,250
as these babies which basically means

130
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,110
that they're raising their kids with no

131
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,709
gender so they're not a boy or a girl

132
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,790
they just form a thick be baby I don't

133
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,410
know why they had to call it that it's

134
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,880
not like babies is a gendered word you

135
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,850
can still call them babies anyway so

136
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,220
basically these parents

137
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,870
raising these babies or babies I can as

138
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,430
a gender-neutral so basically they're

139
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,810
not telling them they're a boy or a girl

140
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,520
as they're growing up because they want

141
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,650
the baby to decide on its own which

142
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,700
gender it wants to be 100% sir is this a

143
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,050
real thing you can look it up and you

144
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,100
guys know I don't normally speak out

145
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,690
about you know more serious

146
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,950
controversial topics but that's the

147
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,690
thing when I first saw this video I

148
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,860
didn't think it was serious I literally

149
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,480
thought it was a joke and I'm sorry I

150
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,770
know this will offend a lot of people

151
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,720
especially the people who are already a

152
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,370
part of this this movement but I think

153
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,020
it's ridiculous I'm all for the

154
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,980
transgender community and the gay

155
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,630
community and the lesbian LGBTQ bar s

156
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,250
tuv god I don't know there's too many

157
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,390
letters now I'm all for people doing

158
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,800
whatever the hell they want to do as

159
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,880
long as it's not hurting other people to

160
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,590
be honest I think this one has gone a

161
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,180
step too far I think it is harming

162
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,190
people it's harming the baby these

163
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,270
babies are gonna be so confused maybe

164
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,070
not when they're worth their parents but

165
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,390
when they start to meet other babies and

166
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,710
those babies are like what do you mean

167
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,180
you're not a he or a she min these

168
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,530
parents are almost guaranteeing that

169
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,200
this kid is gonna get bullied when he

170
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,880
grows up she grows up they grow up

171
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,990
that's why they called it babies and the

172
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,610
thing is I like to think I'm a very

173
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,350
open-minded person I'm always open to

174
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,030
hearing new ideas this is like come on

175
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,710
you copy a little realistic here a baby

176
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,300
should not be able to make a decision as

177
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,100
important as that in fact a baby should

178
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,950
not be able to make any decisions at all

179
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,900
on other than which toy to play with and

180
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,310
even then we read aside which toys the

181
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,810
baby can choose from these babies are

182
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,010
freaking idiot there's a reason why we

183
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,360
don't treat them like a dog because if

184
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:42,050
we did I'm pretty sure that would be

185
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:42,050
considered abuse shut up

186
00:05:49,090 --> 00:06:18,940
we're wait did he just he's been down

187
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,580
there for a while

188
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:25,810
yeah like four minutes now it's crazy

189
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,190
man Wow and I know you can argue that

190
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,450
these babies aren't actually making

191
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,979
decisions - they're a little bit older

192
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,750
like when they can talk whether that's

193
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,830
like age two or three I don't know when

194
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,120
babies start talking but I'm pretty sure

195
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,590
at that age they can still answer the

196
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,240
question are you a boy or a girl yes or

197
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,410
no or they can say boy or girl by that

198
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,729
and that's still way too young to be

199
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,380
deciding anything I mean even if there

200
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:42,700
were four years old or five I mean have

201
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,840
you ever talked to a five year old

202
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:49,180
before they're still really really dumb

203
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,740
hey good to see you again you do I see

204
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:56,320
you brought a little Timmy here with you

205
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,520
I did say hi like he's so shy at times

206
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,080
that once you get him going

207
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,050
what'd you do today Timmy well my mom

208
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,289
took me to the park and we went on the

209
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:11,650
swings yeah do we then I swing on the

210
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:13,720
swings and I swing did Oh

211
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:19,270
the swings it sounds like so much fun

212
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:21,010
and then I then I swing did 2 4 4 2

213
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,360
whole times Wow

214
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,770
two whole times this is awesome and then

215
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,650
after there were there was a green ball

216
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,200
and and the ball came by me and I could

217
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,020
kick the ball I kicked it and then it

218
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,870
was rolling on it and on the grass which

219
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,840
was green like the ball was green with

220
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,870
the grass and green ball was green and

221
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,240
it was green and it was green and then

222
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,039
he was greens to the ball green you

223
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,750
idiot okay obviously I'm going a little

224
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,460
over the top but you guys get the point

225
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,680
any rational person knows that little

226
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,580
kids let alone babies aren't developed

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,510
enough to make these kind of

228
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,280
life-changing decision

229
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,780
I mean if this movement is really about

230
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,550
the kids and about these babies and

231
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,290
giving them the power to choose why stop

232
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,670
at gender what's next why not let kids

233
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,080
choose their own name why did you get to

234
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,250
choose it up normal they want they just

235
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,570
ask the kid when they first start

236
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,790
talking what's your name why can't the

237
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,900
kid be named mama or Dada or Google or

238
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:15,460
gaga I guess it could be gaga

239
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,840
maybe that's why eighty gaga is a baby

240
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,890
now we know yes that does make you more

241
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,480
success and that's just the beginning

242
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,710
why do you get to dress your kid up when

243
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,120
you go out in public what if he wants to

244
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,290
run around naked you don't know or why

245
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,460
do you get to choose with the baby eat

246
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,230
shouldn't you just take it to the market

247
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,700
and let it point at what it wants why do

248
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,170
you put diapers on them why do you

249
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,030
potty-trained there why do you get to

250
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,560
decide where the baby can and can't go

251
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,570
approve that that is butter all

252
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,830
oppression because big bundles and

253
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,690
babies should be able to express their

254
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,520
buttholes wherever they go under where

255
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,060
am I going with this this slide mean my

256
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,620
meds

257
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,450
by the way you better not be picking up

258
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,920
carrying or touching your baby in any

259
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,090
way before it can speak because if it

260
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,770
can't speak it can't consent if it can

261
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:50,100
consent that's assault and also the baby

262
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,750
did not consent to be born so you

263
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,550
basically kicked it out of its home you

264
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,560
did that okay this is ridiculous that is

265
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,390
my point you don't need a baby's consent

266
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,920
no give babies those choices because we

267
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,260
know what's best for them because babies

268
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,050
and little kids are just useless loud

269
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,760
disease-carrying moochers that depend on

270
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,930
adults to take care of them and make

271
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,330
decisions for them because you're just

272
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,190
too stupid and then just physically

273
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,250
pathetic to be able to survive on their

274
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,250
own

275
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,210
Wow what is wrong with me I really do

276
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:23,250
hate kids you guys get the point you can

277
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,080
probably see why I enjoy this series and

278
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,370
why a lot of people get a little mad so

279
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,660
I'm sorry to other people within I

280
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,910
probably offended

281
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,170
obviously I'm half joking when I say

282
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,120
that I hate kids I don't actually hate

283
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,590
kids my points remain the same and don't

284
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,740
get me wrong I do love kids in fact I

285
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,660
want to have a kid one day I just don't

286
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,490
want to have a baby who knows you know

287
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,530
maybe all it takes is for me to just

288
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,190
mature a little and for me to experience

289
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,910
it myself

290
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,830
maybe there's something I'm missing

291
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,720
because I'm not there to experience it

292
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,280
myself maybe if I had a baby of my own

293
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,260
and I'd be so in love with it and

294
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,150
blinded by the potential of what could

295
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,950
be that I'd love every aspect of it even

296
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,870
the negative even as a newborn maybe if

297
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,630
it's my own kid I won't see the newborn

298
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,420
house like this dirty red gross looking

299
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,370
squishy thing and I'll see the true

300
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:12,090
beauty the potential of what could be

301
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:14,040
that the actual miracle of life yeah no

302
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,780
that's that's still gross that is come

303
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,860
on that is this girl's right I think

304
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,860
definitely as Davies
