1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,680
so as you know it's a very important

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:11,820
time all around the world because the

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:13,440
Olympics are funny I'm learning how to

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,480
harmonize yet I still don't know how to

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,250
split screen but one day hey guys so

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,900
Summer Olympics are finally back again

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,390
the Olympics are a time for friendship

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,340
hey it's a time for competition ah it's

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,439
a time for friendly competition it

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,300
sounds like a donkey Hey ah it's a time

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,710
for five major regions all around the

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,570
world to come together and compete in

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,740
peace hence the five Olympic rings it's

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,940
kind of funny how the yellow one stands

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,079
for Asian the black one stands for

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,610
Africa and of course the entire

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,230
background is gonna be white it's a time

18
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,860
for your older not-so-funny uncle to

19
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,450
make those lame Olympic jokes that'll

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,370
say it was pretty good so maybe you

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,129
should join the Olympics huh it's a time

22
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,500
to win medals upon medals upon medals

23
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,789
upon Meadows whether you like it or not

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,829
the Summer Olympics takes over the world

25
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,320
every four years and I just have to ask

26
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,879
you guys am I the only one that doesn't

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,289
like watching the Olympics I'm just

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,910
being completely honest with you guys I

29
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,140
don't find it to be very entertaining

30
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,059
mean don't get me wrong I'll watch

31
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,949
gymnastics now and then not because I

32
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,479
like the sport but because we're good at

33
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,920
it for some reason and because of my

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,390
opinion I have to deal with people every

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,500
four years who give me crap for not

36
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,939
watching the Olympics I mean I don't

37
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,020
mind if it's like this hey you want to

38
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,460

39
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,930

40
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,240
Olympics what the Olympics are so

41
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,770
exciting then why I'm it's just a

42
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,409
personal preference I don't like all the

43
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:27,150
sports of this no I mean why are you

44
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,560
here then Oh see I told you I'd learn on

45
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,740
a split screen maybe you should join the

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,939
Olympics were editing hope anyway I

47
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,770
don't care the people love the Olympics

48
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,659
I mean I've tried to force myself to

49
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,729
watch it and be like hey Ryan this is

50
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,229
really fun it's not but I can't stand

51
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,939
when people give me crap for an opinion

52
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,780
alright I deliver sir I'm gonna watch

53
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,159
now I'm not really into the Olympics oh

54
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,220
wow I guess I didn't realize that you

55
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,869
hated the US I don't yeah you don't

56
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,869
support your own country what if you

57
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,880
don't like their culture then move I

58
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:59,219
don't support my country I don't support

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,570
my country well I guess I actually don't

60
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,930
do that much I'm not like in the army or

61
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,759
anything

62
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,290
but I love my country I love my country

63
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,760
more than that person that seems the

64
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,470
laughter my high school sporting events

65
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,650
and tries way too hard to show off their

66
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,650
voice

67
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,430
I might not be the most patriotic person

68
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,050
but just because you watch the Olympics

69
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,130
it doesn't mean you support our country

70
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,990
any more than I you're not being

71
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,770
supported by watching it on TV only

72
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,820
thing you're supporting is that's

73
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,350
keeping that work you're watching it on

74
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,610
and plus people don't watch the Olympics

75
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,960
because they want to be supported they

76
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,640
watch because they want to win for

77
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,870
example your country were a child you

78
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,280
wouldn't be one of those supportive

79
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,490
parents because if you were it would

80
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,150
look like this hey USA yeah win or lose

81
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,980
today

82
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,130
doesn't matter to me I just want you to

83
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,480
do your best okay thanks dad

84
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,620
see that would be supportive but we're

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,940
not like that we'll be one of those

86
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,560
competitive parents we try to live all

87
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,690
their dreams through their kid and USA

88
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,130
yeah yeah we better win today bring home

89
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,640
that gold medal all right buddy

90
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,770
hanging out a trial to my bed no no you

91
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,020
need to win okay we ain't losing to the

92
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:09,470
damn Chinese again but the tag is

93
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,850
Japanese Japanese Chinese whatever they

94
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,170
all look the same so you don't watch the

95
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,550
Olympics to support your country you're

96
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,959
just that part that wants their kid to

97
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,370
win so that you can be like my kids

98
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,570
better than all the other ones but over

99
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,860
off the Olympics are supposed to stand

100
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,450
up for peace between the five major

101
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,220
regions of the world it's the complete

102
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,239
opposite of why people walk so I don't

103
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,860
have I get a lot of hate for this

104
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,540
opinion because I already do in real

105
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,709
life but ask yourself this if your

106
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,180
family and friends didn't watch what you

107
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,590
still watch if it wasn't so conveniently

108
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,090
broadcasted on so many channels would

109
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,170
you still watch we didn't have amazing

110
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,610
athletes like Michael Phelps or the

111
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,780
entire US basketball team would you

112
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,370
still watch because the supportive

113
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,360
person would say yes if not maybe you

114
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,530
should stop we didn't like your being

115
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,790
supportive stop pretend like you're

116
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,650
helping our country and stop giving

117
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,120
people like me crap for not watching hey

118
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,310
you're pretty fast talker there maybe

119
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,720
you should join the shot up that was

120
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,720
washed hey that was me
