down not a hundred percent friendship

39
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,110
but it's gonna happen I think I'm gonna

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,270
build a purse that I can attach to call

41
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,880

you to see the problem is maverick is

48
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,869
timid which is weird to me you guys know

49
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,340
maverick he's an aggressive bird but why

50
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,619

you and you buddy you've got to stop

56
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,030

76
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,410
was a ICU row row hi guys I literally

77
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,390
bought 800 feet of rope in these two

78
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,130
boxes problem is I saw this pillar bro

79
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,980
and I'm like yo how cool would be if we

80
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,959
wrap the rope around it 800 feet worth I

81
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:15,959

82
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:19,049
wait what about me bro I'm just gonna

83
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,299

much bro guy but I'm a row connoisseur

85
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,260
but I've never had this much wrong okay

86
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,880

87
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,250
runs with crunch to solid foundation

88
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,720
right solace conduct exactly though we

89
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,739

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,390
bottom of this because I got this

in Aspen Colorado at least right now so

281
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,490

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,320
like this Lake app on my foot I'm gonna

283
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,060

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,769
myself just try to create I'm just

286
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,640
trying to create themself exactly and

287
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:23,500
this place is out of cell service now

288
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,440
notice that kind of adventurous type

289
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,140
yeah we try to be yeah exactly nom there

290
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,329
was this popular campground or place to

291
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,550
shoot my heard for the lake and all that

292
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:37,149
I never been to so I pull up to the

293
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,890
bridge to get to this place off the main

294
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:42,399
road there and I saw a fair warning

295
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:45,339
signs and all this I was like oh maybe

296
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,200
if I go past these signs whatever if I

297
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:50,170
stay in the car a bear can't kill me you

298
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,440
know but legit nasa least of my worries

299
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:56,230
obviously I come up on this truck facing

300
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,810
one way and this other car there

301
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,420
basically parallel and I saw just two

302
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:04,240
chains or guys with their hands on top

303
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,700
of their head and I get like yeah like

304
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,350
that the two guys yeah standing like

305
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,520
that yeah I thought you guys staying

306
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:15,370
like this exactly after that I started

307
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,529
inching forward and I saw a car

308
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,950
the truck I saw hand come out of the

309
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:26,380
truck and waving forward and so I went

310
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:33,730
forward and then he came out with the

311
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:35,320
gun we weren't that far like maybe fifty

312
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,810
feet away from each other or something

313
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,160
I thought maybe okay maybe I have a few

314
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,440
grand worth of camera equipment in my

315
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,330
car I have you know I have my wallet

316
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,940
it's not filled with long showers good

317
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,740
job so just I wasn't robbed me like like

318
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:51,520
okay so the first of the first for me I

319
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,990
can get through this but no it wasn't

320
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,820
that at all he had no intention of

321
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,770
robbing he had no intention of robbing

322
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:02,770
me at all his intentions for some way

323
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:04,120
there to kill me this guy who you don't

324
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:09,320
even know he doesn't even know you

325
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:13,250
wanted to end your life yeah he was dead

326
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:16,340
whatsoever I pull up people's economy is

327
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,170
to chance eventually get away so how'd

328
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,880
they get away their distractors our he

329
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,530
was yeah so there was another car

330
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,080
pulling up so he started pointing a gun

331
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:26,810
at them and then I kind of got the hint

332
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,180
at their plug in a run and if I had the

333
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,890
opportunity I am 100% when I took the

334
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:39,160
chance to run but your foot is broken

335
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:44,330
yeah and it wasn't it wasn't there so

336
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:46,160
when they ran that was kind of like it

337
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,110
for me I was like you know those the

338
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,750
only opportunity I had there's no little

339
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:53,570
service here there's no one here this

340
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,520
guy clearly wants to kill someone today

341
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,010
like this is maybe this is his way to

342
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,320
you're the only one left I'm the only

343
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:06,620
one left with a broken foot with the

344
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:09,110
parsley what's going through your mind

345
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,510
that I didn't get to do what I want to

346
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,900
do with the end of my life that my

347
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:17,600
family I could say by them I think it

348
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,780
basically live the life I want to live

349
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,780
bro

350
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:29,150
and I just 100% wasn't ready to die when

351
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:32,600
you're in that kind of situation it's

352
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:35,360
hard to really put into words and you

353
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,670
think your life flashes ahead of you and

354
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,600
all that like they do in the movies and

355
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,740
all that men

356
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,800
let me also do it done that's not empty

357
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,740
but that's what I'm saying

358
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:52,280
you guys this does not happen in real

359
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:55,760

and they try to negotiate with them and

373
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,610

I started like analyzing his movements

382
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:06,589
seemed aspired whatnot this guy's crazy

383
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:10,070
he's also willing to die and wanting to

384
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:11,420
die and the cops offered him what he

00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,750
will here's a square million dollars

386
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:17,150

387
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:20,000
got from him was he doesn't want that he

388
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,790

391
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:35,270

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:37,430
knew I wasn't happy even only at 21

393
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:42,470
years old you've been at 21 years old I

394
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:45,480
knew there's so much more I want to do

395
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:48,210
that's so much regret

396
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,590
how much needed from in my lifetime it's

397
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,559
like something came over me

398
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,929
where I wasn't going to die on the

399
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,909
elephant a lesson is dad taken which I

400
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:59,700
hadn't do something about it at one

401
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:02,639
point she open the rear driver's side

402
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,130
door and it kind of sat a little bit

403
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:06,659
into it and I saw him getting paranoid

404
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,820
and looking around like checking her

405
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:12,600
snipers and stuff like that at one

406
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:16,919
moment still this close on each other

407
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:21,419
he backed up and looked away towards the

408
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:23,730
street and it almost led it was like and

409
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:26,850
so I kind of like ducked behind the

410
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,549
truck man right there and just waiting

411
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,710

00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:34,679
screaming and yelling and swearing all

413
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,409
this stuff and I knew I had run up this

414
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,570
