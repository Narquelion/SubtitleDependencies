pull away late could be wait that's my

98
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:21,900
manager he signed the waiver I hear you

99
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,500
alright look when I put the bounce house

100
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,600
ball pit in my room the original intent

101
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,210
will buy Celia the original intent was

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,470
not for me to break my $20,000

103
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,470
chandelier thus rendering it useless

104
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,060
so we can't really jump on it and I'm

105
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,920
gonna be honest guys the original intent

106
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,140
of these balls was not to do but rather

107
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,700
we have a guest bedroom and there's like

108
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,590
this weird spot like here let me show

109
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,390
you yeah we have this guest bedroom but

110
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,760
there's this little spike crawlspace

111
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,650
down here this guy creepy super creepy

112
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,090
so the idea was to get balls and make a

113
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,440
ball pit down there so it's like kind of

114
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,640
fun and not so scary but then it was

115
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,380
like you know how do we transfer them

116
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,180
for my room to here it's a lot of balls

117
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,610
