because there's a crucial piece of

117
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,200
information I think you guys should know

118
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,030
Spencer manager Jeff they were there on

119
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,620
the day I did not brief them I'm just

120
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,240
gonna have them speak honestly cuz this

121
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,190
is what happened that morning when we

122
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,660
were in class what conversation took

123
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,370
place first off I got to start by saying

124
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,690
you spoke this into existence literally

125
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,010
it was my fault there's a hard time at

126
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,020
all at the beginning of a skydiving

127
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,280
class we get into harnesses and they

128
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,480
basically run you through some checks

129
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,850
right so we're doing the emergency

130
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,530
procedures casually yeah nothing but air

131
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:40,490
II gotta know this guy starts starts

132
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,770
kind of like letting his imagination

133
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,050
loose the wrong way I'm just like yo

134
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,610
like what what are the chances actually

135
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,290
happens like why would I why would I cut

136
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,070
away of my main treats that kind of open

137
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:54,440
Logan says yo I feel like a lot of crazy

138
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,240
stuffs been happened to me this could go

139
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,310
wrong the teachers like basically just

140
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,660
like no there's no way you're gonna be

141
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,700

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:11,390
like you have no idea she's like you're

145
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:14,060

146
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:17,690

like you flipped like okay let me

183
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,930
explain let me explain your main

184
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,790
parachute takes three to six seconds to

185
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,620
open I go to pull the pull the ripcord

186
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,360
but he was right as I pull it it gets

187
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,700
stuck in this like little square shape

188
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,870
so I'm like okay cuz you're still going

189
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,400
right so I'm like I'm gonna give this a

190
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,750
second like it could still open up it's

191
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,610
happen before it takes like a second

192
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,890
longer to open up but I'm also spinning

193
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,230
right the cord is wrapping around I'm

194
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,090
getting a line twist they call it and

195
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,650
about four seconds in I realized the

196
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,680
pears are still nasty opening so I

197
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,600
started tugging on it I'm like oh okay

198
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,940
remember three to six seconds for this

199
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,830
thing to be fully open real time I'm

200
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,430
gonna play exactly how long it was when

201
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,430
it wasn't open

202
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,350
it's like not it's like 9 seconds I

203
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,240
think I don't know but we showed you a

204
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,550
building yeah so eventually I'm like um

205
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,870
I am gonna die I'm gonna die first up I

206
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,339
can't believe this is happening cuz I

207
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,209

208
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:58,120

209
00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:01,540
