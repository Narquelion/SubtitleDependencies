85
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,510
switching gears a little bit I was

86
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,460
browsing snapchat and you guys know they

87
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,620
have articles right like there's stories

88
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,270
topical events about pop culture etc

89
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,520
anyway I was looking at one and it

90
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,380
involved a dog like kissing a girl in

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,960
like the exchange of bacteria and it

92
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,910
said this every time you kiss a dog you

93
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,440
exchange about 10 million bacteria it's

94
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,860
probably twice that amount if you kiss

95
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,050
Logan Paul bro what done I read this and

96
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,970

97
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,680
what huh why don't they come after me

98
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,120

99
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,220

anyway bro so I'm gonna see what my mom

102
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,280
thinks about this I have something to

103
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,050
show you

104
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,950
can you see it he put you on it over a

105
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:11,110
glass I can see hey what I say that that

106
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,370
was an article on snapchat why oh no I

107
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,060
thought it was because of his luscious

108
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,010
lips

109
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:26,830
they call him Lexi combination is

110
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:30,600
luscious and sexy Oh Lexi yes okay so I

111
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,600
sent him out if you kissed Logan ball

112
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:38,320
why why why what you're super clean wait

113
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:44,230
how do you know he's cleaned uh because

114
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:50,200
my mom raised us for one second how we

115
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:53,020
just let this slide huh no I already do

116
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,420
I took this matter into my own hand and

117
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,840
I got a doctor to come over to the house

118
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:01,320
and swab both my mouth and Coggs mouth

119
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,940
and see just how much bacteria is

120
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,060
factually exchanged

121
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:13,840
so let's flashback to when that happened

122
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:15,700
oh and so the inside of the mouth okay

123
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,550
and what it's checking for is overgrowth

124
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,710
or what bacteria right exactly how much

125
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,540
bacteria I have what about the dog we do

126
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,470
the he's pretty chill there's not much

127
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:29,110
going on in there yeah all you gonna do

128
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:36,460
is just just bend over right I don't

129
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:38,290
know yeah no hesitation there okay you

130
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,520
really went after it when humans and

131
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,320
dogs kissed do you know how much

132
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,790
bacteria is exchanged how much is

133
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,230
exchanged I would have you know I don't

134
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,030
have an exact number but it wouldn't be

135
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,010
entirely different from the exchange of

136
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,600
bacteria between human and human like

137
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,800
really making out with someone oh they

138
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,420
just have different bacteria because

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,850
their mouths are a lot dirtier than

140
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,310
human mouths yeah I would hope so I take

141
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,650
pride in my hygiene you know so like if

142
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,120
someone were to say like I would kiss

143
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,740
like a dog or like I have the same

144
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,400
bacteria in my mouth as a dog I would

145
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,389
like try to

146
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,280
not say that's true thanks bro yeah

147
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:12,250
further White's saying now we gotta get

148
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,020
the dog dog did his swabbing like a good

149
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,220
book yeah doc says I need to make out

150
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,270
with you to figure out the exchange of

151
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,949
bacteria when people kiss they exchange

152
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,110
bacteria right how do you how do you

153
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:25,000
figure out that number the exchanges I

154
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,919
read a thing that's been when humans and

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,600
dogs kissed they exchanged ten million

156
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,949
bacteria when the number and then and

157
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,490
then it's Alice who said which is

158
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,199
probably less than Logan Paul which is

159
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,470
me all right so they like hurt my feet

160
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,090
yeah it's never going for you yeah so

161
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,160
I'm just trying to like prove them wrong

162
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,590
do them wrong you know what I have a

163
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,680
feeling and you'll have a scientific

164
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,180
proof okay yeah because like you know

165
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,039
like I don't want girls singing like

166
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,760
it's like bad to kiss me or there's
