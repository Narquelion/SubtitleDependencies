our good friend kiss I uploaded a video

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,150
he said why I beat Logan Paul that's

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,980
interesting cuz I don't think you did I

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,420
thought we'd tied I'm pretty sure we tie

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,920
I know we tied here's a picture of us

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,930
you're on the right side as you can see

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,330
both of our hands are raised commonly

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,439
referred to as a draw but okay I see I'm

12
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,150
actually gonna be making one of these

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,920
pretty soon to is like a round by round

14
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,150

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,380
should have won the fight so if you guys

19
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,780
commentary and perspective is on the

20
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,969
fight and see how he interpreted the

21
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,280
fight before I do my full analysis so

22
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,600
let's dive in why I'm here to explain

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,399
why I won the fight Oh was a time but

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,280
okay all right judges got it wrong

25
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:56,480
stay out like absolutely biessed know

26
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,480
scooby-doo laughs it's coming back to

27
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:08,520
his brain he doesn't understand why I

28
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:13,350
was wearing the mask coming from the

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:16,350
dude wearing a full mask nice jobs see

30
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:20,310
him was that doing a few frames just to

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,759
see what he does whenever I try son it's

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,030
interesting cuz ki is definitely more

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,640
technical than I am um at this stage in

34
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,380
my boxing career anyways that's one of

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,110
the pros he had over me his um

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,430
experience and his ring knowledge really

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,659
really helped him in this fight because

38
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,180
I think he's been training for about a

39
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,130
year and I'm I'm I was like four months

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,619
in well you know he had a really good

41
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,360
job that's a really good job I gotta

42
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,090
give him an thanks man yeah I know my

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,350
tweet I'm pretty quick and I discovered

44
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,200
that I have a pretty lethal jab

45
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,310
literally a week and a half before the

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,320
fight so it's gonna be cool in the

47
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,090
rematch being able to build things

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,009
around the jab sort of just relying on

49
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,079
like one punch he takes his time he

50
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,729
really doesn't want to attack but he

51
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,950
taught me that was good right obviously

52
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,840
I I I can eat punches today's I did

53
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,250
notice that about ksi I was impressed I

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,020
wasn't because I hit I hit pretty hard

55
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,080
didn't seem to faze him too much who's

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,210
got a chin OC he was getting me so

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,770
he started being a bit cocky but you

58
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,800
know that wasn't gonna face me I don't

59
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,750
know that never affects me I disagree

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,470
that's the one thing I noticed after the

61
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,390
first round

62
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,790
I'm telling you his spirit change his

63
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,470
demeanor changed wasn't like King ksi

64
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,390
that he portrays on the internet I think

65
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,430
he realized that it's this was a real

66
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,560
fight and like he says he wants to go

67
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,660
pro right but you have this like dude

68
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,400
who like barely learn how to box

69
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,320
who just whooped your ass and is now

70
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,750
taunting you in front of millions of

71
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,640
people I know that got in his head I was

72
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,230
a few good punches that so yeah he got

73
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,910
he told me he got me there pretty good

74
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,330
so I was there like come on let's go

75
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,880
after I hit him like with five five hard

76
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,530
punches in a row man I was trying to be

77
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,780
a showman like you can see I'm standing

78
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,420
there with my arms out and in reality I

79
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,520
just have attacked him but yeah first

80
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,330
boxing match got a lot to learn still

81
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,430
your boy always first up first up on the

82
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,290
ring like my stamina and condition is

83
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,940
always on point so I always made sure

84
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,950
that Fitness is number one because that

85
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,870
essentially is what wins you fights

86
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,820
that is so true and don't get me wrong

87
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,410
we condition our asses off like I've

88
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,019
never been in that good of shape in my

89
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,340
life like we would run for so long so

90
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:23,600
many times during the day and I just

91
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,370
wouldn't get tired but something about

92
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,690
this boxing match you know being in

93
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,250
front of the people being at my first

94
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,290
fight for the first time it's different

95
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,420
dude like it just drains you and he

96
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,519
knows that and I think next time for

97
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,489
sure definitely gonna up the fitness

98
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:41,510
physique stamina game give him that job

99
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:46,010
in the cross and then uh I've gotta

100
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:49,700
admit man this boy loves to clinch oh my

101
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,560
gosh you'll see I get so frustrated with

102
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,080
it and the referee tells me off for

103
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,030
because I'm flooring him across he did

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,950
not like the clinch the clinch is like

105
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,720
when we would get close and I would kind

106
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,550
of grab him or hold him or like he'd do

107
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,190
the same to me yeah I know he did not

108
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:08,150
like that I [ __ ] hate is pissing me

109
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:10,430
off a lot more friends to try and get

110
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,530
him to jab just so I could slip under

111
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,140
and you know create some create some

112
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,900
openings so I was really wild with our

113
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,840
right hand but I realized that the

114
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:24,020
overhand is working because he's

115
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,569
probably used to very traditional

116
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,669
way of flying so if I made it scrappy I

117
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,949
knew you wasn't gonna be able to deal

118
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,599
with it that is very true that is very

119
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:35,090
true this dude came in here fighting

120
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:37,550
like a dog like he uses terms like

121
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,830
overhand right or like hook but he's not

122
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,949
throwing like these punches they just

123
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,629
they're crazy coming from Timbuktu and

124
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,039
he got away with it in this fight you

125
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:48,800
want to go pro man you're gonna get your

126
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:53,060
ass kicked it thrown like that so okay

127
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,090
so now you're probably wondering yeah

128
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,220
why did I yeah him off to the ball

129
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,590
Wow ladies and gentlemen it's because

130
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,050
this model hit me twice after the bell

131
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:06,680
but you don't see it what what do you

132
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,659
mean bro first off that is false second

133
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,520
off you don't see it dude there's a ref

134
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:12,860
in the ring millions of people watching

135
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,020
it's on video what are you what are you

136
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,930
talking about the bells wrong he's

137
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,819
hitting me once and then he's hit me

138
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,479
again with his fright and I'm there like

139
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:26,120
nah dude dude dude this is boxing if the

140
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,039
bell rings and my arms in motion and it

141
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,479
happens to hit like tap you not even I

142
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:31,370
don't want to say hate you that's just a

143
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:33,440
sport that's how any sport when the bell

144
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,690
rings the action then stops well you

145
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,550
don't got to be like a sport about it

146
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,159
and blatantly hit me after the bell by

147
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,340
giving him hard line it's a little job

148
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:45,440
it's a little job like it doesn't matter

149
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,479
dude if you like stab someone with a

150
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,120
pocketknife versus like a large-scale

151
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:52,250
knife you still stab someone okay

152
00:05:50,120 --> 00:06:00,469
horrible analogy but you see what I'm

153
00:05:52,250 --> 00:06:03,889
saying right ah wait what guillotine ha

154
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:06,529
ha let's go oh gee stopped himself

155
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:10,370
bralla curity didn't even hold it well

156
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:12,229
again you see go talk to Merrigan sand

157
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,460
and that's when he clinches so whenever

158
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:18,560
oh this mother okay listen

159
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,909
true totally true but I will say a

160
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,440
clinch is a very it's a pretty mutual

161
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:26,449
maneuver like when I clinched I go over

162
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,009
he goes under we're kind of like hugging

163
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:29,479
I'm not holding you there that I would

164
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:30,680
be wasting my energy I'm kind of just

165
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,990
like leaning out a little bit that's

166
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,639
part of the sport I don't hear any other

167
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,960
boxers complaining about it if you

168
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,980
didn't like it you could have pushed out

169
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,240
and tried to hit me with you

170
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,790
did sometimes but yeah it's definitely

171
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,050
the wrestler in me kicking in another

172
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:47,660
right so there so I threw him bad

173
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,580
because this model was constantly

174
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,510
clinched me I'll stare like fun stop

175
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,520
punching me yo yo you're a king scumbag

176
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,220
of a fighter like you fight dirty bro

177
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,690
and I'm trying to like box this is one

178
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,310
of the big problems I had with the fight

179
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,990
he's fighting dirty and he's doing

180
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,220
things that aren't legal in boxing and

181
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,900
for some reason this is not being

182
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,090
accounted for in the score I think why I

183
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,270
won and why I would have given me the W

184
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,280
is because he's fighting dirty and no

185
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,130
points were lost for that apparently I

186
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,250
knew Logan was very tired you know he's

187
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:22,880
got such a large frame so much muscle

188
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:25,340
that I knew all the lactic acid etc was

189
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,380
getting to him suddenly ksi is a

190
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,880
biologist I knew the lactic acid

191
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,680
combined with his white blood cells

192
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,190
would create a foam and a window of

193
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,670
fatigue like the only way to win this

194
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,730
was to be scrapping wild I needed to

195
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,140
just get up in his I respect that I mean

196
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,730
it's true it doesn't really like I can

197
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,320
see here like mock his fighting style

198
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,520
and say he doesn't look like a boxer

199
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,720
he's just like going out swinging his

200
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,680
arm but at the end of the day like it's

201
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,320
part so no no room to talk really for me

202
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,870
cuz it was working and he got up in my I

203
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,720
needed to just get up in his just

204
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:16,310
because he hates that he hates it when

205
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:20,480
people are close to him Chloe he

206
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:23,060
clinched to save his life he knew as yo

207
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,560
to be honest with you quite simply if

208
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,490
you don't like the clinch pick a

209
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,230
different sport

210
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,790
pick a sport where you can do something

211
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,440
if your clinch to make some martial arts

212
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,050
for example by me in the Octagon

213
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,150
actually fight me I would love that

214
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,860
a boxing stand crazy hard but it's half

215
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,240
a fight I use half my body

216
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,919
there's no submissions there's no

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,080
grappling there's no throws ro if you

218
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,849
don't like it pick a different sport

219
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,680
like stop whining and do something about

220
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:51,140
it alright we go again look again just

221
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,080
he would do this often he would like

222
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,620
duck under like this and slip his head

223
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,500
in my cubby hole and then whine about

224
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,520
being in my cubby hole I don't know what

225
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,730
he was doing here

226
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:08,720
what was he there now that's some

227
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:10,880
illegal move that I should have I talked

228
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,860
about this in my video my analysis I'm a

229
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,420
good sport man I literally probably

230
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,100
could have broke his ribs right there I

231
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,300
should have done it I should I really

232
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,520
should keep because he was just laid

233
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,720
back right here and there was just full

234
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,250
torso exposed ribs my hand was up oh

235
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,470

00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:40,160
again Oh another right he's getting so

239
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,029
excited oh there another right did you

240
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:48,800

241
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:51,200
another right there again another hold

242
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,070
on a second did you guys see that there

243
00:09:51,200 --> 00:10:00,830
was another right another one if I did

244
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:02,779
more left hooks I in the van 15 inch

245
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,430
dick I'd be a porn star to a pathetic

246
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,370
old man I mean hopefully we can all

247
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,430
agree that round 1 and 2 Logan has won

248
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,770
I'm three and four I have one like let's

249
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:16,339
accept that as a fact I can get behind

250
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:18,470
that I could see I could see that okay

251
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,240
Logan was definitely told here he's come

252
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,029
back you're gonna need a prayer pressure

253
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:32,060
on so that's why Logan came in straight

254
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:33,380
off a good quick Oh God I can't wait til

255
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,329
I get actually good at this sport

256
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,730
overseeing round five though he did miss

257
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:40,370
a law for argument's sake I'm gonna say

258
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,839
this was Logan's well I appreciate that

259
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,470
that was my round right so right now

260
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,950
Logan is winning round 1 round 2 round 5

261
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:52,250
and I'm winning round 3 around 4 okay I

262
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:54,410
can get behind that I him with a job and

263
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,079

289
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:29,210

293
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,880

299
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:03,530
the match was a tie but your dogs

300
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,460
fighting style and cheap fouls and were

301
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,160
unaccounted for

302
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,690
you're lucky you're lucky they were they

303
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,180
