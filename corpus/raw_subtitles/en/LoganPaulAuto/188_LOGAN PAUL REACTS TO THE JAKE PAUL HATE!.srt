I'm a maverick bro I can't be stopped

105
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,240

107
00:05:48,219 --> 00:06:04,840

frown upon that wear this shirt for a

116
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,560
reason guys like I'm a maverick I don't

117
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,750
really listen to like what society deems

118
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,469

about the low game however I will say he

271
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,240
is right in the center like there's not

272
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:55,129
nothing he can do given the fact that

273
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,300
he's a vlogger and like this is what we

274
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,110
do to literally just like be

275
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,069
entertainment

276
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:05,480

277
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:06,259
sorry but it's nothing all right there's

278
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,899
some gaps

279
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:11,389
yeah when you say it out loud and just

280
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:13,699
look all right don't here's my finger

281
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:15,829
Jake Paul my brother is a maverick

282
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:16,960
literally this this brand what I stand

283
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:19,750
like the

284
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,550
he doesn't care about society he doesn't

285
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,960
care about following the rules he pushes

286
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,310
the boundaries he makes people

287
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,050
uncomfortable that's like that's what he

288
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,910
does that's why he's successful and he

289
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,920
knows that no matter how many people had

290
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,290
on him or say whatever they want to say

291
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,000
he doesn't need you to be successful

292
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,890
like he the my man's gonna be a

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,779
