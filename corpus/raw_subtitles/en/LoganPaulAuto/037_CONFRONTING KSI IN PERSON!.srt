private jet to Vegas to get your day

20
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,120

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,059
chance I you call me out in a boxing

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:53,460
match y'all saw ear subscribed the other

23
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,410
day had my friends hand-deliver some

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,579
maverick Mertz to ks eyes house I

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,899
figured he'd appreciate some of the

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,190
hottest merch in the game that you can

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,629
get now in Logan ball that got a shot

28
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,430
free shipping for this week only but he

29
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,870
wasn't home he um he's in Vegas right

30
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,970
now straining at the Mayweather camp

31
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,860
which I trained in a month ago and a lot

32
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,200
of people have been asking Logan is the

33
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,510
fight going down are you fighting ksi

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,070
I'm not gonna lie we're having issues

35
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,070
with the contract what's the deal

36
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,049
manager Jeff chaos eyes team thinks that

37
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,310
he's more valuable than you hahaha so

38
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,110
our teams are kind of classy right now

39
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,530
in deal points in my mind this is pretty

40
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,140
simple

41
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,250
5050 he's a huge youtuber in the UK I'm

42
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,020
big in the United States

43
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,979
seems like it should be pretty easy to

44
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,450
work out if they're being a little

45
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,650
difficult and as you can imagine he

46
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,299
thinks my team is being a little

47
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,250
difficult actually he texted me the

48
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,530
other day and he said your team is and

49
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,850
not replying properly sort this out else

50
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,210
this fight isn't happening and I'll

51
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,280
fight Adam Sala who is Adam Sala first I

52
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,810
actually have no idea why would you turn

53
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,790
down the biggest fight in youtube

54
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,220
history ever it's just dumb bro I think

55
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,770
he's scared of you right he wants an

56
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,170
easy fight yo JJ you scared bro no

57
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,799
reason to be scared JJ I've never boxed

58
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,539
really in my life

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,030
the point is we can do the chat in the

60
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:03,950
hubbub in the talk but I figured if I

61
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,360
just approach him in person and handle

62
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,710
it and try to close the deal write that

63
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,640
in there while he's in the United States

64
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,229
right because he's not gonna be here

65
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,450
forever he's like an hour flight away we

66
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,160
hop on the PJ find him I actually know

67
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,620

like Floyd Mayweather is training him

94
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,959
while he's in Vegas it's gonna be

95
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,640

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,570
was looking at this kid he's a youtuber

00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,980
we like trying to learn how to box he's

145
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,169

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,230
we do it different he didn't seem happy

150
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,150
about me dropping the merch off at his

151
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,560
house but it's okay most of it most of

152
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:52,190
it was woman stuff and I told him it was

153
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:55,250
mainly for his mom the Train like he

154
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:57,169
fights just relaxed too lazy this is

155
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,880
literally almost identical to when my

156
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,950
brother Jay confronted his brother I

157
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,210
don't know what it is about these kids

158
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,620
where they're big over the internet and

159
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,669
then you approach him in person and this

160
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,380
happens now come on dawg

161
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:13,100
you know what you wanna post me talking

162
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:17,470
to talk walk the walk I'm very

163
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,470
disappointed in what I saw

164
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:28,460
I'm feeling a lot of things right now

165
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:31,080
excitement tension savagery but mostly

166
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,789
disappointment I walked into the

167
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,279
Mayweather gym expecting a fighter a

168
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,820
champion someone ready to handle the

169
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,829
situation like a man but all I found was

170
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,990
a scared youtuber who calls himself a

171
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:46,470
boxer sitting on the couch like a sloth

172
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:49,100
during his training I smelled the fear

173
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:52,620
in him I saw it in his eyes

174
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,329
now as I fly back to LA I hope JJ honors

175
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,839
his handshake in the fight goes down in

176
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:57,360
August

177
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,040
I also hope he gets off the couch and

178
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,839
watches that bandana that he wears every

179
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,209
second of every day of his life because

180
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:08,670
it was smelly I would know my nose was

181
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:10,880
right next to it now it's time to end

182
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:14,010
this cheesy voiceover on one final note

183
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,829
