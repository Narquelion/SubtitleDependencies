1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,410
go to giant feel sick but to okay why

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,360
the mood is kind of somber this all of

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,040
us woke up this morning and we found out

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,080
about the despicable incident that

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,609
happened in Las Vegas I did not know I'm

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,010
sure you do at this point by the number

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,320
right now is that 50 people have been

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,180
shot and gunned down with over 500

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,930
injured this happening so close to home

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,730
guys Las Vegas is an hour flight like

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,410
rattles me logs are usually

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,690
light-hearted and are usually fun but I

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,570
think when stuff is this serious and

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,460
people like me with the voice with an

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,989
audience somehow affect or change or

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,090
amend the situation I think it's our

17
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,280
responsibility to do so I just want to

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,780
say if you live in Las Vegas or know

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,120
anyone that lives in Vegas heart is with

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,950
you the low gangs heart is with you stay

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,360
strong the world is Rudy this happens so

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,739
often at this point they're almost

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,180
getting brushed off like oh it's just

24
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,820
like that that thing happened that's

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,469
horrible this shouldn't be like a daily

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,359
thing like that's disgusting human

27
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,600
beings need to change I'm tired of

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,820
seeing the hashtag pray for Orlando pray

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,890
for Paris pray for Vegas like thoughts

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,110
and prayers aren't working anymore we

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,630
need to induce some so what I'm gonna

32
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,350
ask you to do and ask you to ask other

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,720
people around you to do is emanate kinda

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,600
positivity spread light laughter humor

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,270
smiles like man everybody like people

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,350
are so negative never know when

37
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,670
someone's gonna need that little bit of

38
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,460
that little bit of light in their life

39
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,350
that that maybe this guy his name is

40
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,700
Steven paddock maybe if Steven paddock

41
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,840
someone said something to him that was

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,520
nice or something maybe he wouldn't have

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,590
done that's the first step I think you

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,030
can find to reach in yourself start with

45
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,619
kindness and posited eventually one day

46
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,100
we won't have to worry about this book

47
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,680
anymore

48
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,240
