then you peel it off there so you kind

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:14,250

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,070
as you guys know we have been having a

126
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,770
very unfortunate poop problem not

127
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,480
personally but somebody has been pooping

128
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,830
outside of the cool bus like do you see

129
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,110
the row of poops they're like because

130
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,780
like I said this man is over it but stay

131
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,790
on me bro don't put a booth disgusting

132
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,010
and as you know we set up a camera last

133
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,910
night it's up there however I try to

134
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:32,640
catch this [ __ ] person poopy butt

135
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,170
since the bus shut off the Wi-Fi shut

136
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,910
off

137
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,170
and it didn't work guys we didn't we

138
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,180
lost the funds we don't have anything

139
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:43,190
well it turns out that was a problem

140
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:45,500
no no they unplugged it someone

141
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,780
unplugged it we failed on so many levels

142
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,650
low gang like I thought for sure I was

143
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,880
just gonna find the booper it's

144
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,620
unplugged my thing they got no Wi-Fi

145
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,200
who's to say this won't happen again

146
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,490
right the plea for the unplugging both

147
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,190
both from poop

148
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,330
unclogging it's a [ __ ] disaster so

149
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,660
this is the fence we climbed over

150
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,190
yesterday but frickin lock is open so

151
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,380
someone who works here must have

152
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,410
unlocked it unplugged our thing but I

153
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,970
bet they do that in the morning so

154
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,310
hypothetically we could be streaming if

155
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,470
we got a hot spot all night might be the

156
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,030
move bro huh cuz though even if we do

157
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,500
get Wi-Fi and then we plug it in

158
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,000
someone's gonna unplug it which the

159
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,460
camera won't work we need a surveillance

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,960
camera that doesn't need Wi-Fi that just

161
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,310
records and doesn't need to be plugged

162
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,310
