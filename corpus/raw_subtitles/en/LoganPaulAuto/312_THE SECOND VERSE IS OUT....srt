Wow okay guys I have arrived at my

396
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:31,610
destination it is 1:13 in the morning

397
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,350
right now this is like how strongly I

398
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,970
feel about this guys like I just I'm

399
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,160
done dealing with this but okay here we

400
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,230
go leaving my car running okay so I'm

401
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,759
walking up to my destination this may

402
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,440
give you a little hint where it is yep

403
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,850
you got it I'm going to read a comment

404
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,170
because you know I read you guys's

405
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,240
comment and I think this common

406
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,069
describes how I'm feeling perfectly this

407
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,420
is a comment from Nicole Medlin feel so

408
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:51,680
bad for you right now Logan even though

409
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,000
you have gained a lot of attention from

410
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,680
this the video could really hurt your

411
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,120
relationship with your brother it's like

412
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,500
you have to choose between your fans or

413
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,329
your brother there's no good choice

414
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,620
honestly the real fan should let you

415
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:02,300
make your own decision and shouldn't

416
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,480
coerce you into showing the second verse

417
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,160
Nicole that is exactly how I feel I'm in

418
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,110
a really tough position and honestly

419
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,550
like I know the true low gangsters are

420
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,170
true members of the low gang who weren't

421
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,490
here before all this stuff happened and

422
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,110
just stuck around because we're dope and

423
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,670

449
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:32,600

[Music]

460
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:19,100
okay low gang it's time for me to hop

461
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:21,570
into an extremely unnecessary voiceover

462
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,640
there comes a point in every man's life

463
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,840
where he releases a diss track on his

464
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,350
brother and the second verse is

465
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,270
literally too hard to release the second

466
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,810
verse is now in the hands of Jake Paul

467
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:37,760
which may or may not be a good thing but

468
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:40,440

469
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,420

470
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,620
bump in the road to overcome and make us

471
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,620

472
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,950
