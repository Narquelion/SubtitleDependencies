plug the Tesla in look at that yo so

183
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,430
what happens if a Tesla dies like you

184
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,450
can't have someone bring you gas because

185
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,890
it's electric and there's no like

186
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:47,900
chargers on the road we'd have to get it

187
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:50,570
towed we would have to AC and heating

188
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,610
and every oh this is terrifying

189
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,140
I know for a fact Elon did not design

190
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,360
his battery to actually run out of

191
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,890
battery he knows humans are dumbass and

192
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,329
I feel like he accounted for this we

193
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:05,029
gotta tell Andy

194
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:10,279
I think so here's some bad news and 8000

195
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:11,989
we got no models and a no and a we got

196
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,720
this I have no idea if we got this I

197
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:16,519
feel like we definitely don't got this

198
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,910
battery power very low oh boy

199
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:23,239
