it like that my staff we were honored to

122
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,400
have Logan on our team not because of

123
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:58,469
his talent as a wrestler because his

124
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,419
talent is as good people when we went to

125
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:02,370

the van

128
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,159
Logan was studying the entire time time

129
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,349
I'm not this it's giving me goosebumps

130
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:12,810
he was one of our best and he rustled

131
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:16,050
well to get a four a Ford truck a full

132
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:18,180
ride scholarship and the University his

133
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,939
very hard right coach you don't give him

134
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,789
out Logan got all his money to go to

135
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:26,460
college on his academics but could have

136
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:27,240
been football and wrestling too so Logan

137
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,250
it's on you now

138
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,300
hey guys what's up

139
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,650
yeah thanks for the thanks for the

140
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,170
phrasing hi guys

141
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,700
I think wrestling was about setting

142
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,470
goals it depends it depends what you

143
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,840
want to do if you me this sport was

144
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,750
about working hard pushing yourself

145
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,490
being the best you can possibly be and I

146
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,410
set my goals high right away right off

147
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,800
the bat I said I wanted to be the state

148
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,350
champ

149
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,330
that's the session what happened I

150
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,890
trained my ass off on Sunday when we

151
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,330
didn't have practice I was still working

152
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,820
out when I wasn't working out I was

153
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,130
studying because as as much as you don't

154
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,370
like to hear it it is important to

155
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:06,350
balance both school and athletics if you

156
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,390
feel yourself liking the sport and

157
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,520
feeling it feel yourself growing as a

158
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,980
human being because of it stick with it

159
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,650

160
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:18,310
