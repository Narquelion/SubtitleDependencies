00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,689
pregnant now that I think about it

160
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:40,279
though it does make sense cuz she kept

161
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:42,769
telling me she wasn't pregnant it's

162
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,689
confusing cuz she said this yes guys I'm

163
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,279
pregnant

164
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:48,319

00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:11,449
to we work together and we clean the

170
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,370
space look around no confetti maybe I'm

171
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:15,439
responsible after all but probably not

172
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,189
oh my god that was a fun vlog but it's

173
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:18,110

pretentious cocky rich jokes with it cuz

179
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,050

180
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,730
told it was I bought it for $40,000 but

181
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,709
my business team suggested that I get it

182
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,970
appraised in America to find out the

183
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:37,040
