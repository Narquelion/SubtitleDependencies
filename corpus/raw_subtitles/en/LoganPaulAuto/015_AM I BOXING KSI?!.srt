YouTube has been waiting this is

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,079
actually my second attempt at making

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,520
this video because the first one eyelid

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,739

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,370
it somewhat professional guys okay

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,649
here's a little background a British

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,629
youtuber by the name of ksi I think he's

16
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,920
actually the UK's biggest youtubers he

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,719
had a boxing match against his other

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,399
youtuber and he wins the match and I'm

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:57,180
sure you guys saw it for no reason at

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:58,859
all he calls out my brother and I okay

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,359
weird cuz I don't really know this kid

22
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,850
I've had one interaction with him about

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,350
two years ago at the Super Bowl we

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,770
wanted to meet up he texted me he said

25
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,780
try and find me I'm the black guy okay

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,880
and so we took this picture together I

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,770
barely talked to this guy and then he

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,509
calls me out for the whole [ __ ]

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,490
internet honey nom what's even worse he

30
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,350
planned this out like he almost forgot

31
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,790
to call me in Jake out we see him wait

32
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,810
he's like the guys accused of something

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,950
you want to say somebody want to call

34
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,790

35
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,790
anything you want to say it

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,060

42
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,280

00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:01,979
Jesus mother of God I'm here to cut the

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,869
[ __ ] it's over with this video drama's

45
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:09,090

everything

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,930
it's just run away from everything

51
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,870
hearing you laugh is worse than

52
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:29,670
listening to your music is making wishes

53
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,230
for all these [ __ ] you know y'all

54
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,269
have seen the videos guys there's the

55
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,099
videos of me training at the Mayweather

like I am fighting ksi this is going to

59
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:51,269
be the biggest event in youtube history

60
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,200
by far possibly the biggest event on the

61
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,660
internet ever

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,269
it's Mayweather versus but but even on

63
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:03,750
top of that it's the UK versus the US

64
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:05,280
aid like this Scott diplomat a couple

65
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,290
things I want to clear up two one I know

England I love my English fans in fact I

69
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,430
may go far to say after the fight that

70
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,139
England is my city but honestly bro I'm

71
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,450
an American boy like I want to fight in

72
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,709
the US I'm also gonna suggest ksi listen

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,690
closely to this a new through place

74
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,370
maybe like Dubai absolutely my favorite

75
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,750
city in the entire world I don't know I

76
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,650

77
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,000
want to leave it to you guys so I'm

78
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,250
gonna put a pull it to one of these

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,200
corners where you think we don't want us

80
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,220
to fight we got the USA obviously with

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,590
the UK and

82
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,820
like yeah take the pole right here and

83
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,770
to be honest while you guys are doing

84
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,050
that I just want to say I'm down to take

85
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,530
your made-up bedazzled random YouTube

86
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,480
belt

87
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,980
any in any city to be honest I'm cool

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,510
with whatever you want I am gonna

89
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,370
respect that you won the last fight so

90
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,870
that's this is my gift to you another

91
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,450
thing guys we know he doesn't want to do

92
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,320
MMA uh yeah probably a smart thing to

93
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,320
avoid something like this

94
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,579
fine you want a box a box here's another

95
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:08,980
one DJ Khaled autumn Kisai bro

00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,269
I'm not wearing headgear dawg I don't

97
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,439
want to do that that's the last thing I

98
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:12,670
want to do I think it's the silliest

99
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,049
thing in the world I know you wore

100
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,609
headgear in your last fight and to be

101
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:16,840
honest man if you if you insist on that

102
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:18,519
I don't really have any interest in

103
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,229
fighting you and also I want to know

104
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,400

110
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,680
like we have to do it like okay fine but

111
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,780
I want to do everything in my power to

112
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,639
avoid that I know in one video you said

113
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,590
you and I both know that we had to wear

114
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,080
head guards for Alfred safety reasons

115
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,789
okay one if you're worried about health

116
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,680
and safety I'm not really sure why

117
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:46,240
you're getting in a boxing ring too if

118
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,410
you're worried about health and safety I

119
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,229
don't know why you're getting in a

120
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:53,289
boxing ring with me another one guys

121
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:55,900
weight classes right I'm 210 pounds JJ's

122
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,979
like 180 - I am heavier than him so ksi

123
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,539
bro we got to meet somewhere in the

124
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:00,849
middle I could probably get down to like

125
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:02,380
190 while still having energy and like

126
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:04,870
being able to fight because I've already

127
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,500
like kind of slim I would plan I would

128
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,900
plan on you having to gain muscle

129
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:14,220
lastly I want my brother Jake Paul to

130
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,220
fight KS eyes little brother

131
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:21,760
I think that would be great I also

132
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,729
thought if your dad is down my dad is

133
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:28,210
down to Fox your dad

134
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:30,909

135
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,879
family versus mine it would be crazy so

136
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:37,029
yeah ask your dad if he's down oh so I'm

137
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:39,240
