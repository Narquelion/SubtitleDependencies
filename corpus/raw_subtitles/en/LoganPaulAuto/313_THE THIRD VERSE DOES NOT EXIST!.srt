00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,110
about the third verse with the rocker

252
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,060
rocker twin you saw the video it's like

253
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,470
it was first one we beat each other up

254
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,970
so they stole the third verse the third

255
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:07,200
verse from us and then we broke a bunch

256
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,910
of plates to try to get it back and then

257
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,500
Jake did a fight see with him which was

258
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,900

260
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,640
he actually took the third verse brother

261
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:21,090
Jake you didn't take the third verse

262
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,850
because it doesn't no because it doesn't

263
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,200
exist someone made the third first but

264
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,370

265
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,620
