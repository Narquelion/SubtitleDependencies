56
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:44,459
because she may see like a drop off only

57
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:44,850
fans Erin I knew this would come in

58
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,410
handy

59
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,940
six months ago I bought this chastity

60
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:59,790
belt at the flea market actually with

61
00:02:47,940 --> 00:03:03,959
Josie dr. Polanski's approved Wow no one

62
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,799
getting in there except me yeah take it

63
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,010
off you when you get back

64
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,079
have a nice day feel much better about

65
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,820
that the woman's made a massive mistake

66
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,470
and that is she left her dog here her

67
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,880
dog Ronnie you see Ronald's a wiener dog

68
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,910
so I think it's only appropriate if we

69
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,769
put her in a hot dog bun why is this so

70
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:24,930
natural for me yes cuz you were meant to

71
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:26,310
be a hot dog isn't as in pickles okay if

72
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,140
you're anything like me you've always

73
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,430
wondered whether a zebra is white with

74
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,880
black stripes or black with white

75
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,380
stripes

76
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,650
the answer is black base and I'm about

77
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:40,680
to prove to you think I got the chance

78
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:52,260
I ain't gonna waste and y'all know

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:57,379
zebras can swim people bigger than you

80
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,379
can just toss you around put puns on you
