110
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,830

124
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,129
out in the car so here's a voiceover but

125
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,199
it's not that big nothing really amazing

126
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:29,489

127
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,409
that oh it's my baby the Yeti okay this

128
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,639
is me reacting to seeing the Yeti for

129
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:34,019
the first time in forever that's just

130
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,309
like when you break up with a girlfriend

131
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,229
and you meet up to have makeup sex

132
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:38,879
that's how I'm feeling right now anyways

133
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,369
guys it turns out that the tires were

134
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,949
literally almost bigger than Evan this

135
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:45,959
guy a victor he told me that my G Wagen

136
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,449
what's the only G Wagen with tires this

137
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,269
big in the world 40 inch tires

138
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:53,459
oh man not to mention the ladder on the

139
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:55,499
back Evan climbed up on top of the roof

140
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:57,119
rack which we also now have and even

141
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,199
came with an axe and a shovel for

142
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,999
whatever reason you're gonna use a

143
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,009
shovel for but anyways this cool also

144
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:03,659
has these these wires these cables on

145
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,669
the front of the vehicle for extreme

146
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,079
effort actually have no idea what

147
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,329
they're for but I could talk about how

148
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:13,819
cool this is all day but I just think

149
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:13,819
it's better if we doin a bit more job

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:58,680
it's like spinning a wall right now Road

154
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:00,390
no it's just showing nothing and

155
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,160
combined with the little voiceover mic

156
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,690
issue we had that we literally just

157
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,890
found out about that because we went

158
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,690
back and look at the footage and you can

159
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:28,470
hear I leave it over here this one out

160
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:30,870
well we got good news oh it's that way

161
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,280
all right that driveway and climb up in

162
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,570
there I think we can find it bug sick

163
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:38,610
all right so who wants to do the

164
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:40,050
trespassing me are you ah okay so you

165
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,580
got a lock on that signal but we're

166
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,200
closed I think if you stick your ass out

167
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,820
a little bit more it'll elongate the

168
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,660
signal I know just clearly until we're

169
00:08:47,820 --> 00:09:00,250
in Jurassic Park

170
00:08:48,660 --> 00:09:05,059

all right you referencing that huge pile

183
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,130
of dirt yeah put in the divot find it's

184
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,810
a big old pile of dirt here the divots

185
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,270
right here and I definitely see how it

186
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,980
could be a problem to get over we're

187
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:50,580
forgetting something specific follow me

188
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,040
here cuz I got a shovel I was like I'm

189
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,720
never actually gonna use it it's been 30

190
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,639
minutes

191
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,290
like they put dirt here so people

192
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,819
wouldn't do this most vehicles don't

193
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,230
have a shovel included with them there

194
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:03,860
you go keep going I think you're about

195
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,430
two and a half percent there I think

196
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,079
that's good

197
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,240
nothing to it but to do it there's a

198
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,310
high chance that the same thing that

199
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,149
happened to Evan in his mini Yeti today

200
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:16,009
could happen to me right now I

201
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:18,319
definitely don't want that that's a

202
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:23,000
steep hill bro chances are this could

203
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:25,460
