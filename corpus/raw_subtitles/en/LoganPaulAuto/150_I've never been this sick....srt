a music video oh how do I say this

88
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:53,100
spending you yourself cuz yo normal like

89
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,620
singers and artists they all they have

90
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,840
like record labels right and the record

91
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,850
label will pay for the music video me as

92
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,410
you guys know I'm my own brand I'm the

93
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,720
production company I'm the distribution

94
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,610
nobody I'm everything so consequences of

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,919
that just as much as it rocks is like I

96
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,660
have to spend a lot of money I don't

97
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,580
have but I want to if I can make the

98
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,790
best possible product and break the

99
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,380
[ __ ] internet making this amazing ass

100
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,729
music we this is like a good lesson as

101
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,550
well I think I've always been a

102
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,050
proponent of investing in yourself right

103
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,540
so like although I'm spending that much

104
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,850
money I it's an investment in myself in

105
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,900
my brand and I'm sure it'll make it sell

106
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:32,070
back I hope you guys better watch my mom

107
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,930
