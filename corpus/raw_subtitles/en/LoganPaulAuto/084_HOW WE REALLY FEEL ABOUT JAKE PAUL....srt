oh but

188
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
okay guys i feel like i have a bit of

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,520
explaining to do

190
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,360
um if you saw yesterday's vlog you saw

191
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,360
yesterday's vlog you're subscribed

192
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,639
i was i was just goofy i was goofy the

193
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,840
whole day i was doing i was running

194
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,840
around on the highway

195
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,520
it was because the night before we had

196
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
went out dancing at the club

197
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,599
and then i made the mistake of talking

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
to the paparazzi who were waiting

199
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,720
outside

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,160
of the club like freaking rabid hungry

201
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,360
tigers anyways as you can imagine i was

202
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
just not in the right state of mind i

203
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,919
should have never

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,840
opened my mouth and they started asking

205
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,960
me about stuff obviously guys you know

206
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,960
me i had to plug the merch

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,440
tell us about the merch room

208
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,120
but then he asked me oh this is where it

209
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,240
gets gnarly and like i said i kind of

210
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,720
already addressed this but i want to

211
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,840
like

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:58,800

destroyed each other and so she came

219
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,840

bro i'll sidebar this again hey

227
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,320
so yeah there's some there's some

228
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,159
feelings some emotions going in here and

229
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
i know youtube loves drama so i figured

230
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,320
right now

231
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,000
while i'm on a flight to dubai we could

232
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,120
address this situation okay let's start

233
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
with the thing where i said i wasn't

234
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,399
close with jake

235
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,080
to be honest i lied i don't know why i

236
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,680
said that obviously i'm close with jake

237
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
i believe the thought process was this

238
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,279
ask me a risque question right about

239
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
jake getting like sued or something and

240
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,160
they've done this before like they

241
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,440
followed me to my dentist office and

242
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,160
they just catch me outside

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,680
and i like being on camera i vlog i vlog

244
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,000
every single day so i like

245
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,680
i feed into it i suck bro what do you do

246
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,360
when you get paparazzi

247
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
i usually um just don't say anything

248
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,000
they asked actually asked me about you

249
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,279
yesterday no yeah what did you say did

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,920
you tell him i was jotch and where to

251
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,920
get the merch

252
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,040
i i literally didn't say anything but i

253
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,680
plugged my new song that's what i'm

254
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,519
saying so

255
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,880
from now on bro i'm just plugging

256
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,240
anyways the thought process was this i

257
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,399
wanted to avoid the question

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,080
so i lied i was like what apparently

259
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,399
someone's sue suing jake over

260
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
no and then i don't know why i just

261
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,440
didn't shut my mouth

262
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
and i was like yeah dude i'm not close

263
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,040
with jake the issue is that i'm not

264
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,120
closer with jake that i don't know this

265
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,880
what the [ __ ] when i say that i love

266
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,640
this kid i may be the only one in the

267
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,279
world

268
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,040
right possibly but i do he's my brother

269
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,120

270
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,959

271
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,279
