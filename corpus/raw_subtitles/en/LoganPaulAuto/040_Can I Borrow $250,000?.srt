1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:26,000
oh

2
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:27,920
[Music]

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,679
we come a long way from ohio bro it all

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,359
started with an idea that manifested

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,960
into merchandise that's now clothing and

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,160
to see it all on a rack

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,360
although only the first couple

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,000
iterations this is one of the coolest

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,280
things in the world

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,800
and not only that this shit's high

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,680
quality these are one of the items of

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,520
clothing you wear

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,640
and you only wear this i haven't taken

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,239
this off in days i should probably watch

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,960
it soon it's fashion forward it's

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,120
comfortable

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,239
it's sexy and if you have a torso this

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,840
could be for you

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,280
your torso you can find yourself wearing

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,320
this

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
i'm not so good at this i'm proud to say

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,480
that

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
it's it was first an idea in my head and

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,440
now it's come to life and actually i've

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,800
been on the line all day working hard

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,039
preparing it for you guys you know from

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,159
screen printing to drying to folding

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,720
really making sure these clothes are

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,159
made with love

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,840
and we are doing a couple of bonuses as

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,280
well put it some polaroids of me in some

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
of the packaging here not that you'd

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,479
want it but it is packaged by yours

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,479
truly get it out of here

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,280
it's my first ever maverick we just got

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,280
it from the factory

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,040
all right so if you guys saw my last

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
vlog you know i've been dying to get the

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,040
[ __ ] out of los angeles i've been stuck

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,720
in this multi-million dollar mansion for

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
too long i actually think i found the

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,159
place

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,520
unfortunately i can't say where it is

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,880
yet because what happened in yosemite

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,400
this is where it gets tricky because i

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
want to leave today and there's only one

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
person i know that has an rv look i know

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,840
i [ __ ] up your rolls royce when you

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,600

i know when you let me drive your can-am

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,360
i flipped it going four miles an hour

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,119
but i was wondering uh can i borrow that

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,399
i won't you know i don't think listen we

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,560

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,320
you can take it anything that happens

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,439
from this point forward he's stolen i

57
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,439
don't know what happened

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,280

up or down everything's very similar

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,120
simple

69
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,120

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640

80
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,200
like real good looking kid but i don't

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959

82
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,480
driving a 36 foot long rv

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,920
