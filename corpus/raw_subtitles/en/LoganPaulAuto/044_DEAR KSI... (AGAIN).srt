00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,780
would I start when I posted the last

45
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,420
video urging our friend Jay Jay to

46
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,509
simply it's it's very simple I just want

47
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,799
him to respect women and especially my

48
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,869
girlfriend because I asked him politely

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,610
not to bring her in all this drama and

50
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,909
press I thought to myself how will he

51
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,299
respond will he take the L or will he

52
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,149
make a feeble attempt to respond well

53
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,110
folks he it shows the latter and it does

54
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,080
not give much feebler this

55
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,780
was a terrible attempt I tried to knock

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,310
my credibility oh this song there's so

57
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,810
many things I don't even know how I

58
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,470
don't even know how deep I want to take

59
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,920
this role

60
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:27,710
cuz I could I could destroy he didn't

61
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,080
just kind of stop here like it was the

62
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,800
worst response ever that I've seen in my

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,990
life I wasn't saying that Chloe's

64
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,640
crossed it oh my god let's start there

65
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,370
let's start there

66
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,580
no it's Adam explains my blog I'm

67
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,010
explaining why God try to explain what

68
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,590
he meant by telling me I'm gonna have to

69
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,910
my girlfriend like a prostitute might be

70
00:02:48,590 --> 00:03:04,459
the best thing I've ever heard in my

71
00:02:49,910 --> 00:03:07,040
life okay so just to clarify I am not

72
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,650
calling Chloe a prostitute I'm just

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:15,980
comparing to the fact that usually you

74
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:17,570
can't kiss prostitutes okay I'm not sure

75
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,150
I heard that right I mean if you listen

76
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:29,150
to that one more time that usually you

77
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:30,799
called kiss prostitutes usually forget

78
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,730
that you're talking about me going down

79
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:44,360
on my girlfriend but usually you know

80
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:46,370
just got a PR team in the house we got

81
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,130
Mike over there it was got Spencer

82
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,190
sitting over there howdy guys my PR

83
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,500
teams really helping me with this

84
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,840
usually you can't kiss prostitutes and

85
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,290
after I bust up your little ogen you

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,090
won't be able to kiss her either ah

87
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,130
manipulation on its finest ha ha ha I

88
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,820
don't think so I think you're doing that

89
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,820
right now

90
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,680
okay let's address this clearly I didn't

91
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,900
tell the audience to change you can

92
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:28,380
clearly see me signaling that it's not

93
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:30,750
me doing this maybe instead of that hey

94
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,030
guys that's Logan's girlfriend and he

95
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,590
told me not to disrespect her a week

96
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,540
prior to this press conference could we

97
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,880
cool it for a sec I feel like that's not

98
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,010
a hard thing to do or say so you can't

99
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,930
hold me accountable for this because the

100
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,900
audience did it on their own accord

101
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,570
interesting so so interesting because

102
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,860
from my angle it looked like you were

103
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,510
like jumping up and down and like

104
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,550
cheering with them just it's just a

105
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,100
classic method of manipulation if he

106
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,830
felt so strongly about it why didn't you

107
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,280
say or do anything there and then let me

108
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:05,460
show you what that would look like no

109
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,950
she's not she's not a host she's super

110
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:19,080
talented in a seat and has a bright

111
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:23,520
future has nothing to do with me if she

112
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,220
made that video and you knew how she

113
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,800
felt about the way females were treated

114
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,320
I feel like it almost makes it worse

115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,860
that you would continue to say these

116
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,140
things I think that us girls need to

117
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:42,030
kind of stand up for ourselves I'm gonna

118
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:44,940
explore her purse Oh some oh oh the hole

119
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,010
is getting deeper when I made that video

120
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,460
with Cosmo he and I knew that the

121
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,440
comments I was making were joke okay I

122
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,340
don't know I just I wonder how that

123
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,560
conversation went

124
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,320
yo Casper dude I can't make a ksi voice

125
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,850
hey cat hey Casper in this video mate I

126
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,110
think I'm gonna talk about penetrating

127
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,610
your sister horribly okay um well why do

128
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,200
you think that we should do that I just

129
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,820
think would be so funny it's like I

130
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,640
can't do this thing woman the point is

131
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,249
this stupid I spoke with an apologize

132
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,469
and it was all sorted

133
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:20,659
then huh wait wait wait singing was it

134
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:23,629
or did you just like tweeted her but the

135
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:25,159
point is I just I just still don't feel

136
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:28,099
like you're right and she made a video

137
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:31,249
yesterday talking about this titled

138
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:33,319
breaking the silence in the video she

139
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:36,109
said chaos I talked about me in a

140
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,719
derogatory and sexist way and I tried to

141
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:41,389
be okay with it but I'm ashamed of it I

142
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:45,019
cannot believe I'm saying this but Thank

143
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:47,449
You keemstar I know what you're trying

144
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:49,999
to do and it's a shame because you're

145
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,619
young personable fans I'm going to fall

146
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:53,209
for it my young and impressionable fans

147
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,669
are also you're young and impressionable

148
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:57,529
fans YouTube in general has a younger

149
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:00,499
age audience and second off I think

150
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:02,809
anyone can watch my last video your

151
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:05,929
video in this video and deduce two

152
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:07,999
things one you are wrong which is fine

153
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:10,069
if you were to at this point be like I'm

154
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:13,849
wrong I'm gonna do better in my future

155
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:16,549
which you're not and - you're asking

156
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:19,279
idiot it's fine due to stop and make

157
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:21,349
mistakes to get better oh oh he looks

158
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,479
nervous in that clip he's like tapping

159
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:25,669
the desk and stuff you mad bro for

160
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:29,629
simply making a joke about your lack of

161
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:32,479
testicle oh no see this is what I mean

162
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:35,089
his spirit is simply breaking and it

163
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,619
sucks cuz the fights in like 25 days or

164
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:40,329
so listen to the way he laughs at the

165
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:43,489
end of his sentence testicle testicle ah

166
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:45,909
it's just such a sad laugh you hate to

167
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:45,909
see it go

168
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,400
by the way you can pre-order the fight

169
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,430
now link in description KS Ivy Logan

170
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,990
also maverick backpacks 50 ok fair

171
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,450
enough if you want to delete that video

172
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,390
but if that's the case then you might

173
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:08,310
want to probably delete this video as

174
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:11,640
well this is it here's the the old

175
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:16,800
classic bait-and-switch bank this is

176
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:19,380
where he's like no yo yo i'ma be honest

177
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,120
that girl was my friend I feel like you

178
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:27,750
didn't know this girl I see what you're

179
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,720
saying 100% and like I addressed in the

180
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,330
last video however when it comes to the

181
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,700

mistakes in our past some more public

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,600
to do and what I have been doing for the

207
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,970
past seven months is I've removed myself

208
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,730
from the tunnel vision of daily vlogging

209
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,650
is to realize those mistakes pinpoint

210
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,440
them and ask yourself what can I change

211
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,960
in my life to ensure that that does not

212
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,610
happen again or in my case make sure no

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,200
