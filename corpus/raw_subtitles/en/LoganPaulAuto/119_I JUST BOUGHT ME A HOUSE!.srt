hence the mustache family so that's a

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,720
thing also I love one of the Rings I

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,369
bought yesterday I lost as you guys know

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,600
lost at the premiere for my movie King

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,799
bachelors movie uh where's the money

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,750
what I was combing through the footage

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,340
cuz you know her log last I blog

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,259
everything and I noticed at one point I

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,729
was on the bus and if you zoom in here

34
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,830
you can see I'm still wearing the ring

35
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,330
on my pink and then we shot outside the

36
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,009
bus and if you look here you zoom into

37
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,110
my piggy you'll see the ring is no

38
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,090
longer on my feet which is good news for

39
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,770
me cuz that means context clues right

40
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,040
it's on the bus somewhere it has to be

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:43,050
or right when you got off its self

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,550
just say after this we're gonna go check

43
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,110

microwave it's my big day

190
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,620
hahaha magic of vlogging bro if there's

191
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,090
one thing I love about vlogging it's the

192
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,890
fact that I record everything so I know

193
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,380
like when I loose things that ie this

194
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:48,740
ring GoPro like I really like this and

195
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,270
lion cuz I got that light mentality time

196
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,860
to go to West Coast Customs here's why

197
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,909
we discovered a little something on the

198
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,969
bus not so good

199
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:58,099
if you go over like 45 50 miles an hour

200
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:00,110
the steering detaches like literally you

201
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,819
lose control of the bus this is bad

202
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,559
because of death

203
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,119
ha ha ha so I hit up West Coast Customs

204
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:10,369
guys can you try to fix this they're

205
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:12,080
like not try blogging and also I asked

206
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:14,509
them um if you look at the the windows

207
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,069
here remember they tint and unn tint huh

208
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,300
Thank You Brendon however they're yellow

209
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,860
and I wasn't sure if that's how the

210
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,360
windows came or if they put a yellow

211
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,309
tint on turns out the yellow tint was

212
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,199
put on which I don't love because it

213
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:26,330
makes us look yellow when we're inside

214
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,339
the bus I'm already a disgusting color

215
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,659
like pale creamy white I don't want to

216
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:31,309
be another disgusting color like a

217
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,599
mustard yellow oh they have some work to

218
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,550
do we're gonna drop the bus off there

219
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,829
for a few days and my man Kenny's gonna

220
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:39,349
take care of you know so here's the

221
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:41,630
thing when the bus is over like 50 miles

222
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:45,680
an hour the steering wheel like this

223
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:48,380
connects and you can't control it I mean

224
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,759
I hit a car but I think that's it out

225
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,160
from that wasn't because of the steering

226
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:58,579
no that was just I just backed right up

227
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:04,009
into that page come to West Coast

228
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:05,360
Customs the bus gets so anyways we were

229
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,560
about to say goodbye to the cool bus for

230
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:16,310
a couple days but yo you guys know my

231
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:18,949
brother Jake sorry yeah he was in LA

232
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,569
it's a hefty one bro think he said he's

233
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:22,069
gonna turn this into a merge truck which

234
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:24,170
is dope but like you know where to get

235
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:26,029
the March Logan Paul coms last shot but

236
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:30,620
I was thinking I'm like yo this is here

237
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:34,639
I'm here why don't I urinate on it Jimmy

238
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,699
P Brendan Brendan I do this a lot the

239
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,839
only reason I'm doing this is cuz I

240
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:40,910
actually don't have a reason well my

241
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,620
logic is this if my bus I got peed on

242
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,209
like why should Jake's thing not get

243
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,130
peed on in incidence awesome security

244
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,480
cameras Jake install security cameras

245
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,389

252
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,900
like I'm sending my child off to school

253
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,450
for the first time and it's ironic cuz

254
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,800

inside the house and just find it like a

309
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:42,350
new creative space my brain is gonna

310
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,049

311
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,929

00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:50,480
able to buy a house this nice I always

313
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:52,459
believed in myself I was not afraid to

314
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,439
be different be unique be a maverick I

315
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:56,329
worked really hard and I had big goals I

316
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:58,519
haven't said this often but like guys we

317
00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:01,009
all have struggles right when I was 15 I

318
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,679
had knee surgery on both knees thought

319
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:06,439
my life was over like III played sports

320
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,209
and I couldn't anymore it was an 8 to 12

321
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:09,679
month recovery time I couldn't do leg

322
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,360
lifts with the rest of the football team

323
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,799
that's why I have such skinny legs I

324
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,149
mean they're kind of freaking dope now

325
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,439
but they use I've heard they used to be

326
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:17,509
skinny and I'm gonna tell the story

327
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:19,759
again but I wrote down on a piece of

328
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:22,160
paper like a hundred times I will be

329
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,069
more successful than anyone I know I was

330
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,689
15 in Ohio I didn't know what I want to

331
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:28,369
do with my life I just knew I wanted to

332
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,540
be quote unquote more successful than

333
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:31,669
anyone I know like but what does that

334
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,119
even mean was it money was it a monetary

335
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:37,069
thing was it happiness was it love who

336
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:38,989
knows but I just I wanted it and I

337
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:40,009
worked hard and I believed in myself and

338
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:42,410
I kept pushing and pushing and pushing

339
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:46,610
to make that happen and now I'm frickin

340
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:49,850
ah living a different day living a life

341
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,319
of my dreams no gag so the point is I

342
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,819
don't often do these inspirational

343
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:55,309
speeches but if you believe in yourself

344
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:56,989
