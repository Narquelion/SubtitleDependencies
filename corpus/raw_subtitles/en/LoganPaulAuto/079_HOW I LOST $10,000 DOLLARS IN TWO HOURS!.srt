hit the button we are one of the fastest

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,950
growing channels of YouTube this is

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,780
mainly due to our litanies level the

24
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,520
fact that we're all Mavericks the word

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,560
maverick meaning one who does not follow

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,750
the path of others all I gotta say that

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,390
is yayi and as you guys know it's an

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,979
interesting time in my life right now

29
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,899
yesterday my brother put up a very

30
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,500
embarrassing billboard of me I was

31
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,899
offended

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,189
so I threatened to release the second

33
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,409
verse if he doesn't take it down in two

34
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,479
days until Saturday at midnight remove

35
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,730

36
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,510
verse

37
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:05,270

before seen ever unreleased you know

39
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,630
what no it wasn't released it was leaked

40
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,910
because someone spied on us in the

41
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,130
helipad sound terrible I know but I'm

42
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,080
talking the full music video which is

43
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,240
why it's so savage it's such a big deal

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,010

46
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,190

shopping and I also hate it so I bought

61
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,370
