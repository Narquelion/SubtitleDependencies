1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:20,400
I don't know I did not study last night

2
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,020
okay so here's the deal guys we are

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,910
three minutes away from the skydiving

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,130
center as you guys know I failed my test

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:34,470
last time I'm away how many was that

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:36,300
miss how many the questions are actually

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,770
so difficult which I guess makes sense

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,960
since you are risking your life and you

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,910

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,410
