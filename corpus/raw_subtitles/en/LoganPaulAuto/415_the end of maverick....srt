00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:25,380
we started literally took over YouTube

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,150

I've done a lot of [ __ ] in my life

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,500
but recently I came to the revelation I

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,000
want to do some good go for this drop

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,230
it's the yellow hoodie and the black

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,120

23
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:54,359
like we could change the world although

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,100

want it to be in an organic way

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,280
something that's true to me and

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,629

sick hoodies honestly my favorite design

105
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,490
we've dropped it's a little more mature

106
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,060
it's a little more skin radical and

107
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,060
retro we

108
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:22,650

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,360
want to say something it's nothing

111
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,500
feeling inspired lately so we just

112
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,760

113
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,920

114
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,780
retro drop you get one and you give one

115
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,340
to a child in need but one of the things

116
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,990
I think people are forgetting about is

117
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,740
what this what this shift actually means

118
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,780
math maverick slept on I even changed my

119
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,470
Instagram bio to y'all slept on me and

120
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,210
now I'm mad

121
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,950
cuz I'm mad dawg let me ask you

122
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,570
something when you woke up this morning

123
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,420
did you look in the mirror and say oh

124
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,890
I'm a trick [ __ ] hmm I doubt it

125
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,560
something you may have said though was

126
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,870
i'ma be in maverick today I'm gonna

127
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,550
change the world today and you're not

128
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,780
gonna do that if you're comfortable

129
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,160
you're not gonna do that in your safe

130
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,380
zone this movement to me is something

131
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,560
that everyone can do if they just

132
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,740
embrace who they are push the boundaries

133
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,810
push the brown brownies brownies push

134
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,030
the brownies push the boundaries

135
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,290
push yourself get creative and be

136
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,460
comfortable knowing that people might

137
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,080
look at you weird people might not

138
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,220
support your goals but that's cuz your

139
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,950
goals are probably too big for them

140
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,050
little people simple minds that's not

141
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,310
you I know because I was once that kid

142
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,840
oh why am I saying all this is because

143
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,280
like I said guys we've done I've done a

144
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,750
lot of taking I've done a lot of

145
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,350
entertaining and a lot of giving but I

146
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,350
feel like

147
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:41,890
I've not done enough giving and you know

148
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:43,330
I saw so stupid when I'm trying to be

149
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,670
genuine but I really do mean it

150
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,460
I want to start using this platform to

151
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,420
inspire and create change when I can and

152
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,040
that's what this get one give one

153
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,930
movement is because I do want to spread

154
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,700
the Maverick message I want to inject

155
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,830
that into people's brains again because

156
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,200
it is powerful when people believe in

157
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,880
themselves and I feel like it's starting

158
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,830
to happen less and less including me I

159
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,020
was just in a little bit of a rut this

160
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,680

163
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,590
