time to tell you guys about a maverick

213
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,209
moment I was thinking about today as you

214
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,040
guys know the word maverick is someone

215
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:17,870
who exhibits great independence in

216
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,940
thought or action it's like the black

217
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,050
sheep it's the person who's might be

218
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,649
like a little bit different than

219
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,420
everyone else

220
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,160
aka my whole life when I was in high

221
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,660
school just a young shot in high school

222
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,820
we were go to school dances and there is

223
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,380
this kid his name was Jesse and every

224
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,600
dance like before the music started

225
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,760
bumping Jesse would go in the middle of

226
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,709
the dance for a block by himself would

227
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,790
just start dancing no exaggeration like

228
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,160
this

229
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,080
two hours straight I'm not even kidding

230
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,390
end of the dance like his outfit is

231
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,280
soaked in sweat it was like a little

232
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,440
over way and most kids were like weirded

233
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,750
out or I wasn't sure what he was doing

234
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,820
but meanwhile me before I even knew what

235
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,890
the word maverick meant I was like yo

236
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:00,260
