first love my first adventure buddy and

49
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,980
there's so much that I'll miss about you

50
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,380
I'll miss the aggressive sound when you

51
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,060
start if you start in the sound of the

52
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,680
mysterious piece of metal that clanks as

53
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,329
I Drive you I'll miss that I can't go

54
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,610
over 60 miles an hour unless you warm up

55
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:17,350
first I'll miss the garden hose used as

56
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,820
a replacement part in the radiator and

57
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,500
I'll miss the way that the floor fills

58
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,360
up with water when it rains but most of

59
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,880

60
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,150
