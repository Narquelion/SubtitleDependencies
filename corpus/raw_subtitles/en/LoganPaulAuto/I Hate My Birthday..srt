disappointed in fact he all forgot him

79
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,510
for the original crank of the fact that

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,340

this is yeah it's bad is this your oh

84
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,740
this is like why I don't like birthdays

85
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,930
because like I took the first thing I

86
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,850
said today expectation management and

87
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,280
the pressure of like gift giving and

88
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,380
receiving it just gives me so much

89
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,520
anxiety like for two months for all mike

90
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,410
is like you're gonna look at me as a

91
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,880
different person because of the gifts I

92
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,680
asked you for your birthday you might

93
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,850
cry like these are like to kind of guess

94
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,400
they're gonna make you like well I'm a

95
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,500
little bit beyond us with you bro I

96
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,990
don't really care about that shrimp is

97
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,700
dealing why it's not a really a mantis

98
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,950
shrimp dude like it's it's a part of the

99
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,170
reason I I think I'm obsessed with the

100
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,750
mantis shrimp is because I'm colorblind

101
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,210
and the real mantis shrimp is so vibrant

102
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,289
it's kind of just like a monochrome like

103
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,819
shrimp on over

104
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:38,319
like when i walked in i was like that's

105
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:38,319
i don't think that is what it looks like

yeah about that horrible sigh did you

114
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:06,919
think my acting was good when I was like

115
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,149
pretending to heaven that I didn't like

know how you how excited you were to

120
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,339
give me the gift and then now I'm

121
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:21,169
wondering why I feel bad on a day where

122
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,759
I ideally shouldn't have anything to

123
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,180
worry about and this is why I don't like

124
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:29,449
