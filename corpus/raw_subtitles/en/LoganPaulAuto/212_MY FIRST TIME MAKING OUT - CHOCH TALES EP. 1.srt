and I yes enjoy it this one is my first

11
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:37,079
time making out sick believe it or not I

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,489
was quite shy as a kid I didn't hang

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,930
with the boys in my grade because I just

14
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,190
didn't get along with them as well as I

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,600
got along with the girls and this was

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,800
about 8th grade so the time that

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,570
everyone was going through that awkward

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,250
puberty staged the girls were like

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,649
taller than the boys every kid named

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,780
Adam had a mustache like oh god what a

21
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,699
time to be alive now this was also the

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,710
time with boys and girls and sometimes

23
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,870
boys and boys and sometimes and girls

24
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,030
and girls would start touching tongues I

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,530
thought making out was the weirdest

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,600
thing ever I didn't really see what the

27
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,430
point was but the peer pressure to start

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,409
lip-locking with someone was too much

29
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,990
for young Logan everyone else was making

30
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,270
out why hadn't I done it yet and then I

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,770
realized maybe it's because the girls

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,840
had all friends on me and they were

33
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,479
taller than me and preferred Adam with

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,670
the mustache and then who talked to me

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,860
about how their makeout session was and

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,470
I'm listening like what the [ __ ] how did

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,240
I put myself in this position well lucky

38
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,829
for me about halfway through the year a

39
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,990
new girl got transferred to our school

40
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,880
let's call her Kelly she was really

41
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,500
pretty and super cool and we ended up

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,090
bonding in study hall because she liked

43
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,890
drawing pictures of kitchens and I

44
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,810
happened to like looking at pictures of

45
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,119
kitchen to is a match made in heaven

46
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,799
soon enough we were dating which in

47
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,299
eighth grade doesn't mean anything but

48
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,790
we thought we were in love because we

49
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,380
both liked kitchens and I don't know I

50
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,210
guess it's weird saying it out loud now

51
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,500
but it made sense back then so one day

52
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,119
I'm talking all my girlfriend's who had

53
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,369
all made friends with Kelly and they

54
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,590
popped the question hello you know what

55
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,430
are you gonna make hell with her and in

56
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,170
my head I'm like oh [ __ ]

57
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,060
about that man this is stupid I'm

58
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,130
nervous I don't even know how to make

59
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,930
out she's taller than me and why does

60
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,570
that relationship have to be validated

61
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,770
by our dogs of course I played it cool I

62
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:16,810
told the girls uh tonight at the party

63
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,160
obviously and they're all like oh my

64
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,810
gosh we're gonna tell Kelly I'm a girl

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,850
but it was too late

66
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,410
Kelly and I had a make-out date at the

67
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,680
party that night

68
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:30,490
[ __ ] so I can home and immediately hop

69
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,470
on YouTube how to make out and for three

70
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,209
hours watch weird adults teach me how to

71
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,820
touch tongues with another human being

72
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,820
one of which is actually this video Oh

73
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,380
[ __ ] weird anyways I get to the party

74
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,600
and I'm locked and loaded basically a

75
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,160
makeout master and Kelly is standing

76
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,160

77
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,930

78
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,050
up to Kelly and I say can I talk to you

79
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,300

80
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,220
heart is pounding out of my chest so I

81
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,090
give a second battle call but quietly

82
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,650
into myself and I say Kelly hey do we

83
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,160

84
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:18,040
she's like wait you don't want to make

85
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,780
out with me no no I do I just I don't

86
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,730
want to be pressured to do it you know

87
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,980
like we should do it one more ready yeah

88
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:29,140
but we love Logan but Kelly the only

89
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:35,380
real thing we have in common is that we

90
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:42,610
like kitchen Oh Kelly I kind of feel

91
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:44,530
weird and we start sucking face I'm

92
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,090
using all the skills I learned from the

93
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,410
YouTube videos and I'm not sure like

94
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,480
whether I'm supposed to keep my eyes

95
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,970
open or closed and at one point Kelly

96
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,620
and I made direct eye contact and we're

97
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,299
just staring at each other she's like

98
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,650
licking my gums I'm trying not to choke

99
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:59,110
on my own tongue and after the most

100
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,600
Awkward 30 seconds of my life it was

101
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,550
over thank God

102
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:08,340
wow that was amazing yeah

103
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,140
truly remarkable Kelly goes skipping

104
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,440
downstairs happy as a clam and I'm left

105
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,780
in the garage alone and confused next

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:23,820
day the girls rush me like a herd of

107
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:26,760
cattle good and I had to be honest right

108
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,620
so I just said ah I don't know it to be

109
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,060
honest it seemed kind of forced and I'm

110
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,370
not sure I really get the point of

111
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:38,160
making out so she wasn't good no no she

112
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,360
was good I guess like I don't know what

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,790
does that even mean just leave me alone

114
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,940
please and all the girls left that was

115
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,860
once again left alone and confused

116
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,690
one hour later Kelly finds me in study

117
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,500
hall holds up a picture of a kitchen

118
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:56,400
rips it in half so making out with me

119
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,960
with pointless what no I just was I I

120
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,430
don't know Kelly I just wasn't ready

121
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,890
even though I thought it was due to my

122
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,130
hours of YouTube preparation I breaking

123
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,630
up with you I don't love you anymore

[Music]

125
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:13,430
that was once again left alone and

126
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:14,780
confused my heart was broken not really

127
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,150
but it still sucked and for that reason

128
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,340
I did not kiss another girl for two

129
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,260
years listen do not rush into

130
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,460
relationships you will end up staring at

131
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,050
your crush in the eyes when you're

132
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,790
playing tonsil hockey and you'll be

133
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,960
emotionally scarred for the rest of your
