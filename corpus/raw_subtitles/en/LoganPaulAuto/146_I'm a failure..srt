we send it like we were doing today

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,239
Oh as you guys know in yesterday's vlog

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,590
we hand-delivered maverick Merc by the

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,600
way the hottest sauces motion the game

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,950
Oh compile that got a slash out to my

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,950
boxing opponent JJ

00:00:49,900 --> 00:01:02,630
through my boxing opponent ksi start

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:05,210
training for your house by the way

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,710
JJ I got you during my breaks from

20
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,510
social media I've been working on

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,160
skydiving getting my skydiving lesson

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,479
today is a big day because I think we

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,220
are actually getting our official

24
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:17,900
license today as of now technically

25
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,370
we're still just students yo right I'm

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,950
actually extremely nervous

27
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,500
yo egg clouds get the look if we get our

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,880
license we can jump with headphones in

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,590
you can listen to music while you're

30
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,540
jumping maybe the number song which I

31
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,530
just dropped who knows a lot of stuff

32
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,729
and I don't know I guess that's why I'm

33
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,500
a student but the most important one to

34
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,210
me is we no longer have to wear our

35
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,550
jumpsuit now don't get me wrong we have

36
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:47,060
dope-ass jumpsuits obviously but I've

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:48,649
been meaning to jump ass I don't know if

38
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,180
they'll let me do it here but the point

39
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:52,130
is I want to get the license and then

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,990
send it in the nude I'm pretty sure

41
00:01:52,130 --> 00:02:04,520
that's called perish longing yeah I

42
00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:06,860
think so so let's go perish so friendly

43
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,330
they know about Paris everyone I mean eh

44
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,000
he didn't even react he's probably done

45
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,489
it before song together and nothing is

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,049
Paris long time longer I'm alive I'm

47
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:16,910
realizing these clouds are actually

48
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,739
gonna be a problem we live like two

49
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,880
hours away so coming here is a hassle

50
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,040
when we get here right we just want to

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,260
jump jump jump but you model cos gotta

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,030
go home the reason you can't have clouds

53
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,980
in the skies because of the dangerous

54
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,019
factors well I've been in the danger

55
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,920
zone I you guys saw I had that time my

56
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,920
parachute didn't open up

57
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,319

58
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,760

wind tunnel right over there yeah no I

72
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,579

[Music]

90
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:51,250
oh snap you boys sent it Spence and I

91
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,750
actually kind of actually are still in

92
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,450
the learning phase of skydiving oh this

93
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,310
is our pilot are you the pilot you're a

94
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,670
pilot is that the plane will be jumping

95
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,660
out of No thank God yeah we're still

96
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,770
learning stuff that's why the wind

97
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,540
tunnel is good but the thing about

98
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,610
learning though and trying new stuff is

99
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,080
like Yuki I got stumped in that tunnel I

100
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,730
tried to do a barrel roll I like

101
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,960
shouldered the wall and then I got like

102
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,340
flipped on my back and was just

103
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,690
stumbling along the ground like a fish

104
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,520
out of water it was just extremely

105
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,200
embarrassing the point is we still have

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,430
a lot to learn now we are about to jump

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
for the first jump of the day these guys

108
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:25,990
are packing our chutes how come nice

109
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,430
guys you tip them and they pack your

110
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:42,430
parachute the right way if you don't tip

111
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:44,800
them you know it's iron non-licensed

112
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:49,030
jumpers are on a window I'm literally

113
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,470
this close I'm one jump away I know this

114
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,900
morning was the cloud guys and now the

115
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,310
winds God you said yeah here's the thing

116
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,780
about wind delays if the wind is over

117
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,250
twelve miles an hour and you do not have

118
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,840
a license they do not let you jump they

119
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,430
tell how fast the wind is going my flags

120
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,320
and stuff see the flag is blowing but

121
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,910
look I'm an ideas man right i vlog so I

122
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,700
have an idea right now that's some tape

123
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,990
here my idea is if we tape the flags so

124
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,700
it's like stop so it looks like there's

125
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,240
no way maybe they'll cancel the wind

126
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,480
delay it's gonna work nothing to see

127
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,910
here

128
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,950
oh no pay the wind stop

129
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,790
you go tell them yeah but we will let

130
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,630
them know that the wind stop looks like

131
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,230
a wind stop

132
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:31,790
