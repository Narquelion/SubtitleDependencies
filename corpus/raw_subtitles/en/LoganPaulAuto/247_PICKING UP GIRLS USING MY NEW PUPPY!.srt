23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,359
right you stole your dead dogs in what a

24
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,040
piece I'm not gonna lie that that is a

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,630
little I think we're on the same page

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,520
there he was I didn't want to let kong's

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,830
page completely die and be a hundred

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,689
percent inactive rather have Broly here

29
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,060
carry on the legacy of young doggy is if

30
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,439
stuff kinda but I don't know I'm just

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,150
the boy with the dream the point is this

32
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:26,070
well he's a good dog he gave him a bath

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:40,500
his first bath yesterday and flashback

34
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:42,060
now it was super great and we got

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,409
Burrell he's super clean but the problem

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:51,350
is that fur guy he was a troublemaking

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:51,350
little shoe we give him another bath

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,670
then side note Mike lock his door

39
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,299
he's been locking his door I decided to

40
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,219
bust it open

41
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:01,750
look the point is this Broly has some

42
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,729
learning curves to do he's a great young

43
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,859
doggie except I quickly realized

44
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,240
something about if girls absolutely love

45
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,280
him I think it's probably the eye with

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,950
them why have I not used him to get laid

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,670
