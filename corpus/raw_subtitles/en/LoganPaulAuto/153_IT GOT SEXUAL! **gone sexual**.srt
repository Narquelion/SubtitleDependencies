250
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,920
cheesy yeah what it's legitimately to

people and I talked to it it's like just

252
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,270
like army of people we were like we

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,650
literally call ourselves a family

254
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,700
because it's insane how much I connect

255
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,050
with them and they connect them why do

256
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,270
you think people connect with you so

257
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,160
much cuz it's crazy I'm a maverick what

258
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,690
