61
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,840

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,600
NOT giving the Lamborghini with my

77
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:10,489
brother no Lambros the whole like Jake

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,080
pranking me all that stuff and I'll

79
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:13,519
explain but yeah okay first let's focus

80
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,440
on this step number one point five we're

81
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:25,700
going to the store cuz Evan needs a

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:27,320
laptop yeah but cool I sort of feel like

83
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,150
I should have sat down and done like a

84
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,620
dramatic YouTube reveal that I'm not

85
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,270
getting the Lambo cuz it's like kind of

86
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,100
a big deal here's the background if you

87
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,900
guys do not know cuz this this the whole

88
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,150
decision to get a Lamborghini happened a

89
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,580
while ago first my brother Jake on my on

90
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,229
my ski birthday tricked me told me he

91
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,340
got me a Lambo like multiple times it

92
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:45,340
was cruel to just watch

93
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:55,019
[Music]

94
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,560
and then being the Maverick that I am I

95
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,449
was just acting on my feet I was like

96
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,189
skew Jake the only way I can get you

97
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,289
back right now is if I actually go out

98
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:15,289
and buy a Lambo there's only one way I

99
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:19,159
can come back to this and it's if I see

100
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:21,659
things a lot today and buy an action

101
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:24,060
over the next week actually went to the

102
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:25,770
Lamborghini store and customized a 2018

103
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,509
Lamborghini had a cotton perform on ten

104
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,279

this is the right decision look look

121
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:12,539
here's the thing when you're buying a

122
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,129
piece of technology the important thing

123
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,199
about you is that you have a Rolex right

124
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:17,580

125
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,060

funny but Evan just said the word poor

144
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,310
and about being poor it appears as if

145
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,000
Evans poor his account is locked and you

146
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,530

and make it look like he's alone it'll

153
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:30,540

get your virtual over too though is what

168
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,610
we should address no Lambo it's kind of

169
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,260
sad Jake's gonna have a sad reaction

170
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,790
when I tell him but here's why guys it's

171
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,080
just not the move from by the way I've

172
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,580
lived here for like six months I don't

173
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,410
think I've ever sat here anyways here's

174
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,150
why it's not the move for me one listen

175
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:46,300
this is the biggest thing I'm not like a

176
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,890
huge car guy like I like trucks and cars

177
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,270
and driving fast and I don't know if you

178
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,380
guys know this but Jake is obsessed with

179
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,640
cars like I remember once we were

180
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,080
talking about like what we want to do

181
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,370
when we're older and his answer was like

182
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,020
dude I just want to drive cars obviously

183
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,820
like he wants to do more stuff than that

184
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,250
but like that's like he just loves

185
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,130
driving beep Logan Logan Paul not so

186
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,770
much having Lambo is cool but I wouldn't

187
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:08,830
love the Lambo because it was a Lambo my

188
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,990
rush my high would be getting it because

189
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,580
like I'm 22 and like it's not something

190
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,500
I should be doing but screw it cuz it's

191
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,410
kind of a risk which like isn't a good

192
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,000
reason to get a 350 thousand dollar VM

193
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,710
and then I was like yo I can put this

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,720
money towards a house like a dope house

195
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,190
that we live in and and that's what I

196
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,470
did which by the way I cannot wait to

197
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,420

they're not gonna let us drive them in

222
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,400
