everything he's ever got he's a man

30
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,120

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,609
I'm thankful for you and I had a

61
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,109
revelation

62
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:18,879
oh yeah oh yeah I said that wrong yeah

63
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:20,620
I'm his seed though anyways here's the

64
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,659
revelation I was like yo this life I'm

65
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,730
living is absolutely crazy and I owe

66
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,470
pretty much everything I've done in my

67
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,849
life to my parents after all I would not

68
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,970
be here without them and if something

69
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,840
happened where he god forbid passed away

70
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,549
all right cuz he had a heart attack

71
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,750
before drove himself to the hospital by

72
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,010
the way savage but like I don't know

73
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,299
like you never know what's gonna happen

74
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,069
in life guys and if I hadn't done

75
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:46,060
something nice for him I would hate

76
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:47,650
myself so yeah this is it man like I

77
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,810
hope I don't like this too much cuz then

78
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,319
I might just end up keeping it sorry dad

79
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:55,810
oh this is crazy cuz like y'all know I

80
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,250
Drive the Yeti it's a huge truck but

81
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,200
this is like you can put things in the

82
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:05,079
in the pickup ooh you know what speaking

83
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,900
of pickup oh I cannot break this car

84
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,190
before I get it to my dad or can I

85
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,379
content clickbait I gotta tell you what

86
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,859
man if you guys have not bought a new

87
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:17,199
car there is no feeling like driving it

88
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,909
off the lot and also it's kind of hurt

89
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,949
because literally the moment I leave

90
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:27,099
this lost car loses about 30 percent of

91
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:29,949
its value okay about to lose like 20k

92
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:31,720
here we go and I am officially off the

93
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:33,760
law dad I don't think you're gonna want

94
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,639
to return this but now you did can't for

95
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,990
as much so yes the truck is acquired

96
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,699
it's at my friend Max house right now

97
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,560
the plan is every year we go tobogganing

98
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,560
my dad pulls this on the four-wheeler

99
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,229
I'm gonna take him to like the

100
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,430
neighborhood down the street and I want

101
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,630
the truck to be just sitting there and

102
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,770
I'm gonna be like yo this truck is dope

103
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,210
like you should be pulling us in this

104
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,220
thing and hopefully he's like oh yeah

105
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,780
this is cool I could be like in fact why

106
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,669
don't you do that just hand him the keys

107
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,960
Maximus slap the bow on the truck and

108
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:01,580
hopefully it goes great like knocking

109
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,229
like that like that's an amazing moment

110
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,569
oh we need to talk about something

111
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,000
because I don't think that's the truck

112
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:11,660
that my dad likes there's a slight issue

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,349
with this plan okay so I bought dad a

114
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,150
Harley

115
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:15,650
yeah for his birthday yeah I talked to

116
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,009
him afterwards I was like did you want a

117
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,030
Harley or truck he said oh I mean you

118
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,740
made the right decision by getting me a

119
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,449
Harley what if I were to get like a

120
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,210
Tacoma that would have been like

121
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,530
absolutely insane as well so he likes

122
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,870
the Tacoma when it comes to pickup

123
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:38,710
trucks yeah to the Toyota Tacoma yeah he

124
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:41,479
has all who wants an orange Tacoma my

125
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,610
dad doesn't know what he wants right he

126
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:45,860
like he has his desires but sometimes

127
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,349
this 22 year old chach son knows better

128
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,020
this is one of those cases I will just

129
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:53,030
say it's gonna be so awkward if I'm like

130
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,190
you should pull us around in that he

131
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,039
goes no way a Tacoma would have been

132
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,409
better than that here's the thing though

133
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,270
it's still a sick ass yeah no you know

134
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:03,560
what if you make some smartass comment I

135
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:13,669
swear to god I'm not gonna say anything

136
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:15,349
