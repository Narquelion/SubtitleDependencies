asked him what 10 times 10 was very

29
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,020
clear to me that I'm deep inside this

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,150
kid's head this is the beginning of the

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,189
gradual breakdown and even you guys

same I am just nestled in the middle of

39
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,100

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,659
gonna hurt him in the fight but here are

41
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,189
some other of my favorite moments from

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,409
the press conference that's why I've put

43
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,720
blood sweat and tears into this making

44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,149
sure I push myself to the limit and I've

45
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,579

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,430
said you didn't believe you said that

48
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,680
yeah I don't believe so when you say you

49
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,079
put blood sweat tears what do you mean

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,680
when he said the blood part yeah

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,979
internally

52
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,769
[Music]

53
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:17,280
[Applause]

54
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:21,239
eleven times 11 it's 121 i'm quoting

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,680
jeff mayweather okay sighs coach it was

56
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,000
basically a good thing that I was part

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,409
of the camp because I did have to

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,930
harness everybody and to make everyone

59
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,739
realize that no matter what he's not a

60
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,299
real fighter okay

61
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:35,970
all right well you know your coach said

62
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:37,650
that about you we'll see on Saturday yes

63
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,620
we will let farther than is he your

64
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,599
coach I mean yes then why is he saying

65
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,549
you're not a real fighter am I missing

66
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,959
something or are you not a real fighter

67
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,220
I'm a real father

68
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,180
I'm not according to your own comes yeah

69
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,099
yes it was just hard for me to follow

70
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,540
this kids logic he says he's a fighter

71
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,030
but his own coach says he's not a

72
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,980
fighter he doesn't bleed well he bleeds

73
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,720
internally like internal bleeding cuz if

74
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,430
so that sounds like you need to seek

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,459
medical attention being totally honest

76
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,450
with you guys I actually don't like

77
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:07,799
trash-talking and smack talking I'm just

78
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,659
like good at it because I can think fast

79
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,609
on my feet and I'm kind of [ __ ]

80
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:14,250
annoying but it really makes him mad I'm

81
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:16,440
much better at performing and just being

82
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,810
