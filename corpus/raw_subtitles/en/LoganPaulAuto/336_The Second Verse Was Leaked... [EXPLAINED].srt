challenge like my brother made a song

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,760
where he was like basically flexing on

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,619
everybody obviously he got hella heat

30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,760
from that I was like envious in a way I

31
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,170
was like you know Jake's getting so much

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,939

standing on anything that's a cool thing

37
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,330
okay anyway I felt like and this might

38
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,979
make me dumb but I don't want my brother

39
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,159

40
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,220
an idiot like you really he's my idiot

41
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,659

42
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,100
you guys know us we're passionate we

43
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,479
work hard here and the family you're the

44
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,100
lucky you know it and I don't know how

45
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,119
to say this good morning Brendon but

46
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,439
nothing can stop us we all the way guys

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,630
we were driving to the first location

48
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,009
which is actually West Coast custom

49
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,840
they're the ones that are doing like a

50
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,040
remodeling of my cool bus and I think

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,810

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,549
started remodeling it just yet I'd like

53
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,869

55
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:59,610

here's how it looks from the behind the

182
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,470
scenes from my vlog camera obviously not

183
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,870
as hype as the actual music video itself

184
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,390
but it's my content I captured it I

185
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,790
control where it goes blah blah little

186
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,220
did I know and no one on my squad

187
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,230
notice that these two kids we're filming

188
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,320
us and taking pictures the whole time

189
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,240
like oh my god it's just Flynn all the

190
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,740
drama happens blah blah blah I want to

191
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,090
release it I can't release it it goes

192
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,460
too hard blah blah blah oh by the way

193
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,140
the actual music video the edited music

194
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,090
video which is what makes like the

195
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,590
second verse like kind of like oh this

196
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,450
cannot be released on the internet

197
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,310
that's fine as far as I know no one will

198
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,680
ever see that this is strictly like just

199
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,360
the lyrics like the lyrics were Lee and

200
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,270
I guess the person I was shooting with

201
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,830
well so then like the low gang you guys

202
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,990

206
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,200

and I'm like don't we shoot this whole

220
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,209
music video today and the whole day like

221
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,709
everyone's like yo how did you have this

222
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:35,300
key leak look what happened how could

223
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:37,669
this have happened and I'm like bro it's

224
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,110
this guy who I thought was a cool guy

225
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,789
like I talked to him about where he's

226
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,500
from what he's doing and elect me had a

227
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,800
conversation we took pictures together

228
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,050
and it turns out he's just a douche man

229
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,720
he only hosted this for his own personal

230
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,149
game even though I made it very clear

231
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,250
that I did not want this on the internet

232
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,779
so I see this video online not even on

233
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,430
the original account it was posted and

234
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,170
it has 1.2 million views by the time

235
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,670
you're watching this vlog who knows it's

236
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,230
not going to be online anymore but like

237
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:08,120
it probably would have been like 5

238
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:10,040
million and it's just I reach out to the

239
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,870
guy on Instagram like I'm like yo please

240
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,660
take it down to like this is your fault

241
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,820
because in the original video he says he

242
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,050
goes I know that Logan does not want

243
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,880
this on them but I want to give the

244
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,730
people what they want you bro from the

245
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,700
bottom of my heart I lost my cool there

246
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,589
for a second I'm just like broke know

247
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,360
what actually this might be good because

248
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:30,890
this music video that I'm releasing

249
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,990
actually I'm gonna make it a part of

250
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,520
this vlog I just decided anyways like I

251
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,520
said I reached out to the guy I'm gonna

252
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,279
take this opportunity to teach a lesson

253
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,529
I feel that I'm in a position of power

254
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,360
and I can use it to inspire and teach

255
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,680
and help people learn and grow here we

256
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,970
go hey man I just got off the phone with

257
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,350
your manager Jeff I convinced him to

258
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,700
call Jeff and he was dumb enough to

259
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,290
actually do it super cool guy it was

260
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,640
really great to talk to hell yeah that's

261
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,500
why he's my manager I just want to start

262
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,970
off by saying sorry miss Teasdale it was

263
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,070
one of those impulse things I'm a

264
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,690
marketing guy by nature what I see an

265
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,279
opportunity to see growth in my

266
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,899
following and numbers and I made the

267
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,339
impulse move to do it without taking

268
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:05,839
into account how it might affect

269
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:07,970
yourself and your relationship with your

270
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,470
families cube bro I'm a human to do you

271
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,060
