52
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,450

washed

56
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,880
I think anything at my house including

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,350
your body yeah I think so

58
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,030
the rules are kind of like this right

59
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,430
you want to come over my house yo that's

60
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:06,790
great but you gotta clean my bus good

61
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:10,360
job guys oh my god guys the bus is

62
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,830

but now we have to get this thing lit we

64
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,230
have to wrap it with light and I have to

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:26,860
leave her set in like an hour and a half

66
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:28,510
so you're so tiny you start being more

67
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,130
careful like where your body is you know

68
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,540

69
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,780
