that the characters jump off that and

105
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,700

hundred feet in the air but we'll get to

115
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,640
that later it takes a little preparation

116
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,170
anyways right now the characters like I

117
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,370
