well-being and money out of my pocket is

84
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,660

your basic your basic thorough your

124
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,380
basic that reminds me if you guys saw

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,970
yesterday's vlog we made the world's

126
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,430
biggest pumpkin spice latte and that is

127
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,870
a fact however the pumpkin is starting

128
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,400
to rot right so I figured what better

129
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,720
way to clean it up than to kind of just

130
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,920
like lift it like all the way up to the

131
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,460
top of the forklift and then just

132
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:02,490
looking drop it relatable okay so I'm

133
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,540
looking at this giant pumpkin

134
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,100
yesterday we uh we filled it up with

135
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,230
milk and made a giant pumpkin spice

136
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,410
latte so that bro there's still like how

137
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:13,510
many gallons thirty over twenty right so

138
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,940
there's just a skin liquid and coffee

139
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,410
and hay in it now so we're like if we're

140
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,070
on the forklift and the thing falls

141
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,660
while we're in the street that's the

142
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,920
kind of thing that like I would get

143
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,300
kicked out of the neighborhood for so I

144
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,250
hope that doesn't happen it might not

145
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,080
even fall it might just fall apart yeah

146
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,790
like it's rotting and everything but

147
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,710
lucky for us i don't use my brain often

148
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,720
but today i'm going to at the end of the

149
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,180
street boy did we get lucky there are

150
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,530
two trash cans broke just posted cuz so

151
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,510
we're just gonna drive down the street

152
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,250
dump it in the trash can from about

153
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,590
maybe like 50 feet and hopefully no one

154
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:48,390
calls the cops a thanks neighbor bad

155
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,390
ideas and this is one of them

156
00:08:50,810 --> 00:09:00,500
go forward looks like you lined up this

157
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,500

trying to convince her to let us dump it

165
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:14,860
in her dumpster and look I'm not gonna

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:17,110
