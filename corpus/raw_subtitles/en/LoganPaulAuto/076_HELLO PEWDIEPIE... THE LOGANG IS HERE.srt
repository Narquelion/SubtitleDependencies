66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120

that means i will donate a hundred

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,360
thousand dollars to charity now

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
my team suggested i put a cap on the

74
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
donation

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
in case i don't know 100 million people

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,360
click the link and i

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,760
in that case would have to lose

78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,319
everything i own and

79
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,800
that's not good so it's true we've put a

80
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,920
cap on this donation but i will say

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,360
it's very very high so the charity i'm

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,879
choosing is very dear to me

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,319
as part of my continued effort to raise

84
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,920

85
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,360
