look at this this is what he does in the

27
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:07,590
brain scan today they'll explain while I

28
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:09,600
could play with you no more [ __ ]

29
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,640
it's been like 30 minutes if she told us

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:26,670
to get it appraised but nothing I needed

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:27,390
to let's go get this brain scan I'm a

32
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,640
little nervous

33
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,470
deal it's natural I can't hide anymore

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,480
this brain scans gonna tell me why I am

35
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,780
the way I am why am I so controversial

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,980
why I detest cancer I am incapable of

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,710
maintaining a committed relationship

38
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,710
most importantly oh I'm so [ __ ] dog

39
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,780
I won't figure out why I'm so why I

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,560
think it act the way I do I am

41
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,239
emotionally unavailable when that works

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,610
right people tend to work right when

43
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,410
it's trouble people have problem because

44
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,120
I'm a bit of a hooligan a troublemaker

45
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,520
person ever since you were looking yeah

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,739
up until fifth grade I was I was in a

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,970
hole and I was good from then on up

48
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,320
until fifth grade I was just like a

49
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,640
little troublemaker I didn't apply

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,800
myself I was one of the kids I just

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,510
didn't focus or a care even understand

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,209
why I was in school and then fifth grade

53
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,310
hit and I shifted from being a hooligan

54
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,250
to actually literally only studying I

55
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:36,030
became a good egg but um man something

56
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,600
happened in the past four years or so I

57
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,510
just who I'm a rebel rouser so what are

58
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,370
my prayers for my young stars or dear

59
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,380
God don't let me be famous before my

60
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,270
brain is finished developing cuz fame

61
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:53,330
just does a whole number on

62
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,030
yes it does since the chronic stress and

63
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,220
the whole world knows about it it's hard

64
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,170
they diagnosed you with a VD as a child

65
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,330
never officially diagnosed I'm almost

66
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,710
positive I have some mild form of it but

67
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,600
we never saw it as a bad thing you know

68
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,790
a lot of my creativity is fueled by that

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,470
have you ever been treated for your

70
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,180
brain I had a skull fracture

71
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,650
I have a millimeter skull fracture when

72
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,210
I was in the seventh grade

73
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,280
so anything that fractured her skull

74
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,690
generally hurts the right so her my

75
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,220
brains I have a titanium plate in my

76
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,840
head ashes I'm really glad you're here

77
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,420
this could be a would be helpful really

78
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,520
do so we'll look at your brain I'll put

79
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,380
the information in the context of your

80
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,390
life and if we get your brain better

81
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,070
your relationships are better your

82
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,420
judgment is better everything is better

83
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,580
when the brain is not good

84
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,960
you're not good so come with me this is

85
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,960
amazing this is great

86
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,799
[Music]

87
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:59,260
oh yeah like open that yeah yeah hot

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,940
chocolate can you explain what this is

89
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,710
actually doing is gonna make a nice 3d

90
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,690
model of your brain showing us on the

91
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,160
inside what parts are active what parts

92
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,270
aren't which one should be which one

93
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,490
shouldn't be see if there's been any

94
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,820
damage from trauma chemical exposure

95
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:32,290
like that amazing

96
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:32,290
[Music]

97
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:45,540
looks good oh great

98
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:48,120
that's kind of nuts I could see it I

99
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,120
could see my brain from here all right

100
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:57,090
well we're truth we have some answers oh

101
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,980
we do oh come in Oh so the study we do

102
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,900
is called suspect and speck looks at

103
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,150
blood flow and activity it looks at how

104
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,400
your brain works and here's you see you

105
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:09,120
had actually a very significant injury

106
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,040
he broke his skull he was in the seventh

107
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,380
grade and he goes but I didn't hurt my

108
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,870
brain and you see these holes

109
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,290
I know parts of my brain are missing

110
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,870
well but this is it's not missing but

111
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,220
it's hurt and this is really important

112
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:29,190
because right here is the most human

113
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:32,070
thoughtful part of us shut the it makes

114
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,670
you human shut up so it's called the

115
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,860
frontal cortex was in humans than any

116
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:41,400
other animal so it's 30 percent of the

117
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,700
human brain and you heard it which means

118
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,680
you're gonna have trouble with focus and

119
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,130
forethought and follow through an

120
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,270
organization planning empathy so for

121
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:58,170
lazy God and learning from the mistakes

122
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,810
you make we need to fix us if we don't

123
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:04,170
fix this no matter how successful you

124
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,960
are it's going you're not going to make

125
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:09,300
the decisions you need to move your life

126
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,500
in the direction you go so there's there

127
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:16,290
is a reason yeah we either letting the

128
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,600
rest of your life with this brain is not

129
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,430
going to be a lot of fun for you or for

130
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,130
the people who love you okay because

131
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,560
you're gonna have trouble connect this

132
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,680
is the possibility that your brain could

133
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,870
look like just a fat full brain thick

134
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,820
with 2 C's type of brain starts with you

135
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,890
have to love it it's like no I have to

136
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,620
care about my brain because if I don't

137
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,380
I'm not going to

138
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:42,910
you have to avoid anything that hurts it

139
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:46,750
drugs alcohol are you doing anything you

140
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:48,639
shouldn't be doing I drink a lot yeah I

141
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,340
drink like once a week but what I do I

142
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,410
go hard alcohol is not your friend

143
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,430
it actually takes this and makes it look

144
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:59,350
worse imagine Mike's brain broke we

145
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,750
don't do the right oh my god

146
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,820
I don't want and when you drink your

147
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,440
brain probably looks like that and

148
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,970
that's why people don't act right when

149
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,860
they drink because they're damaging

150
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,770
their bra are you doing any high-risk

151
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,260
behaviors quite often yes so why don't

152
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,060
you really think about it your problem

153
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,030
is I need click me yeah no you're gonna

154
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,789
be smarter about getting clickbait if I

155
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,979
fix your brain ah because I tell you to

156
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:26,350
but you already know some of the things

157
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:29,320
that work how can you be more thoughtful

158
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,090
blue is average red and white are the

159
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,000
most active parts of the Brandon and

160
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:36,700
your cerebellum which is right here is

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,279
really good and this is the area right

162
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,080
here that according to a study from UCLA

163
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,150
it goes with intelligence they're smart

164
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,760
ah you're just not making the kind of

165
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,270
decisions help you yeah that sounds

166
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,010
about right

167
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,440
our question is well can we make it

168
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,270
better are you like permanently messed

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,670
up or can we make this better

170
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,459
we've got to fill in these holes I think

171
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,500
it's more traumatic brain injury really

172
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:01,240
needs to be rehabilitated get rid of any

173
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,220
high-risk behavior this can put you at

174
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,260
risk for another head injury because

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,950
this brain is not going to tolerate a

176
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,270
lot more brain injury what about boxing

177
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,779
not if you're getting hit in the Hat I

178
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:16,180
do have to kick one other youtubers ass

179
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:19,540
and I have to box him one more time I

180
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:22,180
don't want you hurting your prey right

181
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,459
so if you fight that guy you have to win

182
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:30,520
and you have to protectors yeah oh yes

183
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:32,980

know that the trouble they have in life

187
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:43,850

shouldn't let kids hit soccer balls with

192
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:54,230
their head or play tackle football when

193
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,889
