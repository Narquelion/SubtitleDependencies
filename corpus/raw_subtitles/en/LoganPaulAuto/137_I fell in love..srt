26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:19,989
[Music]

27
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,430

31
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,739
exactly what it is that we're doing

32
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:56,709

cold place full of dick shots in

half-court shots figures up oh my god

39
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,979
around kids I have something to tell you

40
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,539
I came here today expecting to make you

41
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:36,460
guys a little happier and expecting

42
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:38,580
maybe to leave a little happier doing

43
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,220
something good for the world but you've

44
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:54,039
ruined my life and I've had a horrible

45
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:57,210
time and I want you all to know that the

46
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,210
duck he's gonna chase me

47
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,879
don't worry Kenny goes faster than that

48
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:30,009
you guys are the watts empowerment

49
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,079
centers right what do you guys do yeah

50
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:34,419
so everything from after-school tutoring

51
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,639
music arts dance theater sports teams

52
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,559
everything this is one of the only

53
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,949
neutral zones and watch it this place is

54
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:43,509
kind of readathon you've never had we've

55
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:45,129
been here every week for 13 years

56
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,779
providing mentoring yeah haven't had one

57
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:47,829
person hurt in 13 years I think that's

58
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,899
the most important question I was gonna

59
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:51,249
ask is like who are the kids or these

60
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:53,249
magical beings running around and

61
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:55,869
beating my ass

62
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:58,389
this is watts after-school tutoring

63
00:05:55,869 --> 00:06:00,219
music arts dance theater all the sports

64
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:02,259
scenes if we don't provide it it doesn't

65
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:04,029
exist but it's because the community

66
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:06,699
they really run the center they protect

67
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,769
it so when the average age here is 21

68
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,449
and the largest age group is 10 or

69
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:12,429
younger

70
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,409
so it's kids that are raising kids and

71
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:17,079
the dropout rate at schools little over

72
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:18,939
50% to less than 3% even make it to

73
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,619
college and I'm like guys I love you but

74
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:23,019
I got no money and they're like figure

75
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:24,399
something out what is the gangs that are

76
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:29,469
asking you to figure it out you guys

77
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:31,449
have incentive to try so this is

78
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:33,669
government housing so basically everyone

79
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,739
just lives here this is all they know

80
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,269
and this is all most of them have ever

81
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:38,439
gone within a two mile radius

82
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,639
most of them have never been to the

83
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,839
ocean that they've never been to a

84
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,269
sporting event they've never been

85
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,069
outside a little circumference so it's

86
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,360
like you guys showing up like you're

87
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:48,399
bringing a little bit of the world to

88
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,619
them I think a big thing for us is like

89
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,269
a dream right now what I want is I want

90
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,309
us to be able to build a recording

91
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:55,419
studio and a film studio for like I saw

92
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:56,979
a couple of kids running around like

93
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:58,300
Andre will give him the camera yeah I

94
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,649
was like yo what are these kids like cuz

95
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,459
Andre given cameras like you all want to

96
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,959
be ographers

97
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,729
hey we're just hustling for the hood out

98
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,589
here so like honestly if there's any way

99
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:07,149
you can help us hustle for these kids

100
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,589
because they deserve the best and they

101
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,759
aren't second-class citizens and I'm

102
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:12,309
tired of them thinking

103
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,419
why did you do this and they've changed

104
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:17,860
my life honestly it's just I don't know

105
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,939
I came just because one of my friends

106
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,469
was hanging out here one day and I

107
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,930
wanted to see him but 13 years later

108
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:25,689
every week I'm still showing up for some

109
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,430
reason and they understand that the

110
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:30,099
future is bright but it's not because of

111
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:33,029
some system that's in place but because

112
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:33,029
they're going to write history

113
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,280
I've never done anything like this in LA

114
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,500
or ever in my life

115
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,510
and I like I really do like kids and

116
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,090
like being here makes me like realize

117
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,070
that I think I definitely come by it

118
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,390
more often or however I could help go

119
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,730

126
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,720

135
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,500
moment bro what was it I don't know if I

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,630
haven't had to tear my eye probably like

137
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,970
15 years dude you're lying

138
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,220
ah cuz the girl said that there were

139
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,690
people that said I like people calm here

140
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,590
like for one-time visits and they sit

141
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,180
tell the kids that they're coming back

142
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,390
and no one ever comes back and it like

143
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,790
made me so sad we should do our best to

144
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,430
not be one of those no we are we got to

145
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,350
go back bro and like as I wasn't lying

146
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,730
when I talked to that guy as much as I

147
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,500
did get hit in the dick like I enjoyed

148
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,690
myself too that was a lot of fun I felt

149
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,980
like I was finally around people my age

150
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:20,210
yeah you looked like it dude you're in

151
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:22,160
your full element those kids have so

152
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,290
much energy and there's so many of them

153
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,150
which is actually also like kind of sad

154
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,920
so many kids I mean I've never done

155
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,760
anything like that in my life and I feel

156
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,950
like it really puts it in the

157
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,570
perspective how much different someone

158
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,640
else's quality of life can be I'm

159
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,800
incredibly fortunate and thankful for

160
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,020
what I've been blessed with with but if

161
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,160
I can help them do whatever it is they

162
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,140
want to do achieve the goals they want

163
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,190
to achieve by inspiring them motivating

164
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,080
them whatever it is I really I really

165
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,370
want to do that and I made a point to

166
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,990
the guy I said I don't want to be one of

167
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,790
those people that says he's gonna come

168
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,530
back to the dissenter and not come back

169
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,970
to just abandon the kids forever I

170
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,620
really did have a good time with them

171
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,270
today even though I can't feel my penis

172
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,400
but yeah that is a relationship that I

173
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,400
look to develop further further
