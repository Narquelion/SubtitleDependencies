00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,279
kick the [ __ ] on this kid Thank You ro

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,210

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,490
this a hundred times I was saying on

5
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:14,040

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,929
shoot way to start 2020 we are back we

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,210
are on fire feels good to be back guys

8
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,750
we're about to hit a hundred million

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,960
subscribers and hit that subscribe

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,730
button that's that is a lie the last

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,410
vlog was me surviving military death

12
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,330
camp and before that I did something

13
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,590
nice for my friend Mike's birthday and I

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,080
got him a date with his favorite doll

15
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,809
film star Lana Rhodes however for every

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,910
good deed there is an equal and opposite

17
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,559
bad deed so I read a lot of the comments

18
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,420
on the Lana video and a lot of them were

19
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,920
really nice it was like Logan seems way

20
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,700
more mature and likeable than he was

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,440
before

22
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,969
Logan's gonna make a comeback in 2020 a

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,100
lot of that and I really do appreciate

24
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,160
the sentiment guys however I do want to

25
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,739
make it clear that I'm still a 24 year

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,550
old boy with a lot of testosterone and a

27
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:59,460
burning burning desire to [ __ ] [ __ ] up

28
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,570
that said yesterday I went ahead and

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,570
bought myself a lawnmower

30
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:16,450
[Music]

31
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,440
my days back in the vlog life you

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,330
flipped a [ __ ] lawn mower and put

33
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:38,000
fruit in it consider this breakfast in

34
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:40,310
bed might consider this another body

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,780
shots are both lethal and devastating in

36
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,130
to the artist I think I kind of deserve

37
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,630
one just so you know I can still throw a

38
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:51,380
ksi before this so I'm actually gonna

39
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:53,060
throw a wild right edge I tried to trick

40
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,030
you I had no idea my friend was the

41
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,400
biggest [ __ ] in the world this man

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:03,650
brought my train box who the [ __ ] is hit

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,850
him maybe box is not my sport he's never

44
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,260
taken a body shot he doesn't know what

45
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,550
it feels like I don't so I think you hit

46
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,930
me once I'll hit you once I won't go

47
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:15,080
crazy hard but just so you know what it

48
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:29,660

party late not drinking with a decrepit

63
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,000
boxing coach and

64
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:21,989

keep it short and sweet you know when I

67
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:47,760
first met Jake I was - I remember the

68
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,060
first time I saw imma be honest my

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,859
initial reaction was who the [ __ ] is

70
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:59,730
that and not point fingers but I I do

71
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:01,709
blame you for mom and dad's divorce you

72
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,540
been up your training and I'm inspired

73
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,950
back in Encino just to see your

74
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,079
discipline cuz I've never seen you this

75
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,129
dedicated and focused on anything I

76
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,780
think it's really good for you I think

77
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,030
this kind of isolation is gonna do a lot

78
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,980
for your free personally and obviously

79
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,239
for your career in your business you

80
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,280
keep putting in the work you're at the

81
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,509
finish line and then you've got this and

82
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,930
I'm gonna be here and it's cool to get a

83
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,580
glimpse of just the actual pure

84
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,750
dedication and to your craft and the

85
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,130

87
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:36,479

I got also got to see practice and train

93
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,650

94
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:51,150

[ __ ] out of this kid Thank You row my

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,099
one piece of advice I've told you a

100
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,610
hundred times when I say my camera for

101
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:04,169
the first time do not overconfidence

102
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,720
exactly that's where I [ __ ] up I think

103
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,130
percent I think I wasn't realistic about

104
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,169
the outcome of the fight with ksi I

105
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,210
think that's where I went wrong and I

106
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:14,729
lost on the day you happen to have a

107
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,229
much stronger mental than I have so I

108
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,699
don't even think I need to save I just

109
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,099
