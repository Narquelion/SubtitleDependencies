1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,569
I've made a severe and continuous lapse

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,590
of my judgment and I don't expect to be

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,700
forgiven I'm simply here to apologize so

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,009
what we came across that day in the

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,199
woods was obviously unplanned and the

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,439
reactions you saw on tape were raw they

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:24,480
were unfiltered none of us knew how to

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,820
react or how to feel I should have never

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,689
posted the video I should have put the

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,120
cameras down and stopped recording what

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,899
we were going through there's a lot of

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,230
things I should have done differently

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,829
but I didn't and for that from the

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,200
bottom of my heart I am sorry I want to

15
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,579
apologize to the Internet I want to

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,890
apologize to anyone who's seen the video

17
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,239
I want to apologize to anyone who has

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,809
been affected or touched by mental

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,300
illness or depression or suicide but

20
00:00:51,809 --> 00:01:00,239
most importantly I want to apologize to

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:03,030
the victim and his family for my fans

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,360
who are defending my actions

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:10,920
please don't they do not deserve to be

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,439
defended the goal with my content is

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,080
always to entertain to push the

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,450
boundaries to be all inclusive in the

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,259
world I live in I share almost

28
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,509
everything I do

29
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:27,600
the intent is never to be heartless

30
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:29,490
cruel or malicious like I said I've made

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,570
a huge mistake I don't expect to be

32
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:36,780
forgiven I'm just here to apologize I'm

33
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:41,970
ashamed of myself I'm disappointed in

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:45,229
myself and I promise to be better I will

35
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,229
be better thank you
