123
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,740
banner telling us you're a celebrity how

124
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,870
else would people know celebrity more

125
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:20,200
like YouTube personality celebrity would

126
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:22,720
infer he actually has talent you do that

127
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,460
[ __ ] I always get these poor guys mixed

128
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,410
up is this the douchebag or the brother

129
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,900
riding the coattails of the douchebag I

130
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,410
think you're the douche bag I think

131
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,150
you're right

132
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,000
somehow your hair is worse than yours

133
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,610
two videos

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,709
Myers pretty sure some people were just

135
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:44,219
as babies your peers stick upon your

136
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:46,259
head you and your brother are the male

137
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,740
equivalent to the Kardashians where's

138
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,740
your sex tape

139
00:08:51,709 --> 00:09:01,709
hey Logan what's the color of that fire

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:03,209
oh the only thing better than watching

141
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,740
your beautiful career fail would be

142
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:08,160
watching that piece of paper light your

143
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,410
hair on fire dr. GU blog that's comedy

144
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,240
the probably figure probably awake so

145
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,430
its clickbait he's 100% correct

146
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,290
yeah I could actually my testicles twice

147
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,000
a day every day for the next 40 years

148
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,329
and they still wouldn't be as cancerous

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,100
as you and your brother I just don't

150
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:26,790
like cancer jokes that one was it funny

151
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,149
that was either gonna turn to be enema

152
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:34,069
not just to a profession yes that's me

153
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:36,629
who's essentially a male Instagram [ __ ]

154
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:38,730
little kids to masturbate you what

155
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:40,800
imagine Britney Spears but less talented

156
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,149
and more feminine how are you that

157
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:52,709
person would still be more tolerable

158
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:56,370
than this flaming blonde sack of what a

159
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,990
[ __ ] ah that's cute Brendan you should

160
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,769
be commenting on this pose here we go

161
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,050
here we go

162
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:03,509
the only thing more obnoxious than your

163
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,459
ego is that mess on top of your head you

164
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:07,199
pander to a young audience who is too

165
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,329
naive to understand just how unoriginal

166
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:11,040
and mediocre you really are thankfully I

167
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:12,149
feel safe knowing that your reign in the

168
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,160
entertainment industry will be

169
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:15,959
short-lived and that you ultimately fade

170
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,699
away like the rest of the conformance to

171
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,559
pop culture learn from your mistakes

172
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,559
unlike your brother and move on

173
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,220
nothing's more matches than my ego

174
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,480
nothing

175
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,860
that wasn't even funny they're just like

176
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,750
trying to hurt my feelings but my

177
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,399
feelings don't get hurt desperately

178
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,019
trying to stay relevant I see

179
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,399
I bet making a silly face to make it

180
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,290
hurt less and something you picked up

181
00:10:42,399 --> 00:11:00,730
from your uncle's basement and yeah

182
00:10:44,290 --> 00:11:02,290
everyone hates you too yes thanks

183
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:09,389
someone with as much money as you would

184
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:12,820
