so little brother Jake went first and

64
00:02:51,420 --> 00:03:05,850
Jesus Christ this man ripped ended edgy

65
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:08,040
edgy UK's biggest mistake I think

66
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:16,800
everyone's favorite part Jake and Assad

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:18,720
edgy shoes they show up looking like

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,790
literally just dressed like bums

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,950
same with ksi overall both of their

70
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,110
brands are just like Walmart brand for

71
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,260
example this is how they prepared in the

72
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,120
morning Shumpert's loose loose loose and

73
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,720
then this is how the team Paul prepared

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,030
in the morning look in general they just

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:41,800
suck but the Walmart chant was born

76
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:44,880
I like that one

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,880
I like that one there

78
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,280
oh okay anyways time for the big dog

79
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,110
anyways I walk right up on stage and I'm

80
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,710
not playing games I get right in JJ's

81
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:02,580
face I'm like [ __ ] and then I go hype

82
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,580
up the crowd a little bit

83
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:18,440
[Music]

84
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,440
full of Vegas

85
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:30,169
you know how you play gotta do it right

86
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:31,969
away after static age of waters a little

87
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,960
bit I look JJ right in his eyes I wanna

88
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:34,550
see where his head's at

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,259
because every confrontation we've had up

90
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,349
to this point he did not look me in the

91
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,349
eye

92
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,520
and this time he's actually looking at

93
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,140
me so I'm like okay little little [ __ ]

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,510
boy grew some balls today that's good

95
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,670
and the huge where it gets weird so the

96
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,940
morning of the fight JJ posted a picture

97
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,640
on his Instagram stick out like try to

98
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,530
dig out it just deep bro it's only big

99
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,330
why would you post that picture in great

100
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,560
heights you got a little dick you why

101
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,360
are you giving me ammunition right

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,580
before the conference so I obviously I

103
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,200
capitalized on it looks like you grew a

104
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:18,600
little dick today oh yeah and I'm vegan

105
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,150
and I'm vegan so I recognized a baby

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,860
carrot when I see one oh look man you

107
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,810
want to show your dick fine but at least

108
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:30,480
come pack and heat like me idiot no

109
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,710
that's not a tumor that's my dick so

110
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,360
again this is just what I mean like over

111
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,610
all these dudes is just they're just a

112
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,680
Walmart brand everything they do is it

113
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,680
doesn't make sense it's weird it sucks

114
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,840
meanwhile Jake and I looking like

115
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,880
frickin studs our brand is Gucci and

116
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,200
there's just just straight Gooch and for

117
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,440
those of you who don't know the Gooch is

118
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:58,860
the area between the Weiner and the

119
00:05:51,440 --> 00:06:01,620
rectum okay so I think JJ and Deji

120
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,260
obviously being related are equally as

121
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,180
dumb like mentally they just function

122
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,070
slower than Jake and I do mr. Michael

123
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,900
high is hard to do but they managed to

124
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,980
pull it off the only thing they kept

125
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,980
saying all the time was

126
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,520
creative creative

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,780
good job guys so good so my favorite

128
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,460
moment is when Jake and I did not

129
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,050
rehearse this they started saying it and

130
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,250
just the brother the brother instinct

131
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:38,180
connected to Jake and I were like yeah

132
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:40,210
bro if there is honestly one good thing

133
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,350
that came out of this it is Jake and I

134
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,030
connected like brothers like we haven't

135
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,860
in a while we where we haven't been able

136
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,270
to do something like this and forever so

137
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,160
yeah it's definitely gonna be fun to

138
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,030
beat up these these Punk's together on

139
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,800
August 25th

140
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,150
so then JJ starts talking I I didn't

141
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,770
mind it the more the more he talked the

142
00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:04,040
Dumber he looked I Paul wait to punch

143
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:08,870
you right in your stupid smug face when

144
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,940
you feel when you like bro you're not a

145
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:15,100
supervillain you're not a dragon ball z

146
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,100
character do us all a favor and shut the

147
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,670
conference took a weird turn for some

148
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,110
reason everyone brought props they

149
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,220
brought props we brought props I better

150
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,570
turn into like a fifth grade

151
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,610
show-and-tell he brought his little like

152
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,200
Toy Story stuffed animals that he sleeps

153
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,700
with a night and then he also brought

154
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,950
the YouTube for dummies book that he

155
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,480
bought and I got a mat with his face on

156
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,070
it and started stomping on it and then

157
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,200
we threw away some of our ksi toilet

158
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,240
paper with his face printed on it that

159
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,070
by the way everyone in our house still

160
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,690
uses to this day and then you guys know

161
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:44,690
I got it I got I got to do it I got to

162
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:47,150
make a bed and a joke how many of those

163
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,450
do you have besides the one I found in

164
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,450
the back

165
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,410
it's just cause like I'm wondering like

166
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,630
discern like why does she always wear it

167
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,330
like what's good what's underneath the

168
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:02,150
band and what is so sacred it's so

169
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:07,700
special about that black bandanna that

170
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:09,410
he always has it on and then it happened

171
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,540
bro for everyone who thinks this was

172
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,430
like a joke or it's like fake beef it's

173
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,230
not I'm gonna beat the [ __ ] out of the

174
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,730
kid I really don't like him but this is

175
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,930
where it got real this was the magical

176
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,370
moment of the press conference and it

177
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,590
actually was hand in hand with that that

178
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,080
disgusting smelly bandanna so JJ's in

179
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,030
the middle of mocking my apology video

180
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,310
obviously for everything that happened

181
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,380
in January and I'm not gonna lie it was

182
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,180
pretty creative I had to respect it it

183
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,560
was funny but right away I got in his

184
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,909
face and I let the man talk for a little

185
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,039
bit because like I said like I was I was

186
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,750
like damn this is like homies getting me

187
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,700
good right here what can I expect it's

188
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,810
the one joke everyone makes it's the one

189
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,490
thing everyone talks about and

190
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,320
rightfully so but anyways he starts

191
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,529
talking he says a couple lines and

192
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,650
eventually I'm just like I I take my

193
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:54,170
hand I tear the wig off and lo and

194
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:58,370
behold in front of me right in front of

195
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:01,050
me is the magical bandana

196
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:04,470
all this is happening in a split second

197
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,900
I'm like host I want that this is my

198
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,450
moment I could do the world a favor and

199
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,880
discover what's underneath that bad Dan

200
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,430
I don't even think a sigh knows what's

201
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,930
underneath it it could be my puppy that

202
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,970
I lost in the seventh grade it could be

203
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:21,390
the bridge to terabithia the Fountain of

204
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:25,110
Youth who knows I am so close to this

205
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,670
thing I have one shot that's hope I go

206
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,029
to grab his bandana

207
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:33,779
I got a grip on this mother and I go to

208
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:37,320
tear it off I kid you not in that moment

209
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:41,540
it all made sense to me why he never

210
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:48,570
takes it off the answer is quite simply

211
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:51,839
because he can't that thing is glued to

212
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:55,230
his head I'm not just saying this I

213
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,770
gripped it like all hands and I go to

214
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,580
pull up and it does not budge not an

215
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,260
inch

216
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,420
next thing you know I'm full I'm fully

217
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,650
extended then that thing is stuck on his

218
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,850
head so many thoughts are going through

219
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,650
my brain right it looks like I just like

220
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,570
pushes his head really all I was trying

221
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,250
to do was get this bandana off then I'm

222
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,200
like I secondly I feel bad for jay-z

223
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,190
because some sort of super blue accident

224
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,110
must have gone wrong that he actually

225
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,700
can't take the bandana off and I'm just

226
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,670
assuming it's super glue it could be

227
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,020
stapled to his head it could be taped I

228
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,290
could have been pinned in his hair the

229
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:29,330
point is he was stuck so I push him and

230
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,330
that I had to start laughing about all

231
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,440
and then madness broke out

232
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:46,699
a little [ __ ] board threw a temper

233
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:49,189
tantrum he got so mad he got so mad who

234
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:50,839
does that Matt over bandana if you watch

235
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:53,059
the video play-by-play I'm standing here

236
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,589
like what what is this kid trying like

237
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:56,360
what does he think he's about to do

238
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:58,879
let's be honest AJ you ain't gonna do

239
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,499
soup you're weak you're unathletic the

240
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:08,720
way you charge me in general is just

241
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:10,519
embarrassing just like in the boxing

242
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,869
match it's gonna be the same thing he's

243
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,549
gonna like try to do his thing and like

244
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:15,350
be all athletic I'm just gonna play with

245
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:17,629
him toy with him but just mop so I'm

246
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,610
standing there and he does manage he

247
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:21,649
hits my glasses off of my head to watch

248
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,360
slowly bounces in the air and you boy

249
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,339
catches them I'm just a straight-up

250
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,199
ninja bro okay I'm too quick for this

251
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:28,189
and then his whole squad comes on chaos

252
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,959
breaks aah

253
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:36,170
his trainer tries to slap my brother in

254
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:38,029
the face and Vidale by the way quick

255
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,049
message bro he's their trainer maybe if

256
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,639
you weren't focused on training a bunch

257
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:42,319
of dweebs and you spent your time boxing

258
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,059
professionally like you should be that

259
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:45,379
slap would've landed so I think you

260
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:47,389
should hit the gym and get rid of that

261
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:48,769
beer belly and for now yeah I guess just

262
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:50,929
stick to protecting your [ __ ]

263
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:52,579
so everything wraps up and then JJ later

264
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:54,559
in the week releases the video from his

265
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:56,600
perspective and he sounds like such such

266
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,089
a little little boy like straight-up

267
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,689
just sounded so soft he was whining

268
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:01,689
about it

269
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:13,740
