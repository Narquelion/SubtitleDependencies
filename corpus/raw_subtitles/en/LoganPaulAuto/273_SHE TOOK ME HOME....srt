51
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,630
happened somehow Chloe got asked to

52
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,370
throw the first pitch at the baseball

53
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,130
game she's from Chicago so it's a big

54
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,860
honor and stuff the only issue is

55
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,690
Chloe's really really unathletic like

56
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,430
like I don't think she's ever you know

57
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,860
bro I've known her for a year and I

58
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,720
haven't seen her run once she refuses to

59
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,280
run in front of me I can't imagine what

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,750
it's like throwing a projectile needless

61
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,750
to say this should be interesting

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,040

baseball she played left out

67
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,290
it's like a joke cause it sounds like

68
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,030
left-field but she just sits to bet

69
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,700
