00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,080
pokemon shouldn't be too hard

19
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,840
and it wasn't turns out pokemon is the

20
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,680
highest grossing media franchise of all

21
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,600

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,280

mario harry potter and marvel and with

24
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,559
the 25th anniversary of pokemon coming

25
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,360
up next year i don't see that changing

26
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,879
anytime soon

27
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,840
now i've left pokemon my whole life

28
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,960
literally played the games all

29
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,039
throughout high school made a couple of

30
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,559
vibral pokemon videos on pokemon art and

31
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,160
i only have one tattoo on my body it's a

32
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,440
pokemon named squirtle next to my penis

33
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,960
so i knew there was a lane here that i

34
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,320
did indeed have a passion for

35
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,000
so the first thing i did was find an

36
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,760
expert crazy bro i feel like i'm you're

37
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,800
delivering me drugs this feels like i'm

38
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,399
trafficking a kilo

39
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
but like the price is actually probably

40
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,359
more than that's what i'm saying

41
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,879
look at this look at this meet jake a

42
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,479
collectible guru also known as

43
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,080
collectiblesguru on instagram

44
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,360
he was nice enough to sell me seven of

45
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,119
these little pieces of cardboard for

46
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,880
fifty thousand dollars

47
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,880
yes i paid fifty thousand dollars for

48
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,560
seven pokemon cards and it gets worse

49
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,479
just wait all of the cards have red

50
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,880
label red label is our ps4 this one

51
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,720

52
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,400
first edition thin stamp thick stamp

53
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,000
okay so what is this guy saying

54
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,360
psa9 bgs10 std69 blah blah holographic

55
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,320
first edition bsa charge

56
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,840
what let me break it down when it comes

57
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
to card collectibles there are two main

58
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,360
grading services psa and bgs

59
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,960
grading means they rate the card the

60
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,479
higher the rating the more valuable the

61
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,320
older the card the more value and the

62
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,159
rarer the card the most valuable

63
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,759
this dark blue shadow behind it

64
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,520
decreases the value and the only

65
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,799
difference on one you go to stamp on one

66
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,680
you got a shadow all right i'm gonna

67
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,119
keep this simple

68
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,119
pokemon first released what is called

69
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,000
not surprisingly the first edition base

70
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,079
set indicated by

71
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
the little first edition stamp on the

72
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,280
cards these have the most value the

73
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,200
second release did not have this stamp

74
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,719
and is also known as the shadowless set

75
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,560
still highly valuable because of the

76
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,719
lack of shadow behind the pokemon which

77
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,000
the following set the regular base set

78
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,000
did have

79
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,520
so first first edition stamp second

80
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,239
shadowless third base set

81
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,040
has a shadow got it this is beautiful

82
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,640
this is the one

83
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,200
yeah this is the one the holy grail of

84
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,720
cards this is a nine it just broke

85
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,760
twenty five thousand this card is a

86
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
twenty 25 000

87
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,280
piece of cardboard and you will

88
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,760
literally be able to sell it probably

89
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,599
between

90
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,599

as my collection grew so did my

107
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,800
excitement for the hobby i started

108
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,800
watching pokemon professionals doing

109
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,840
advanced research on ebay and even met

110
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,959

115
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,040
in the [ __ ] world i found out instead

116
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,720
of buying the cards outright you could

117
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,200
even buy what's called the booster box

118
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,720
which comes with 36 packs of cards 12 of

119
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
which are guaranteed to have a

120
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,959
holographic card in it

121
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,360
if just one of those cards is a

122
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,440
charizard you hit the jackpot

123
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,950
in fact josie actually pulled one from a

124
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,400
