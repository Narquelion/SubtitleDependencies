remember when I blogged we did a vlog

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,529
last year with a giant pumpkin I think

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,570
it was actually the biggest pumpkin in

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,160
the United States it was so big that I

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,800
was actually able to do a 24-hour

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,390
challenge inside the pumpkin he's nine

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,670

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,489
