182
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:34,590
many of them go real quick real quick

183
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:36,660
one second you know I thought I'd be

184
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,520
done this keeps getting better and

185
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,910
better so we look at this Brenden found

186
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,380
this actually we're like what is this no

187
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,210
there's a little note on the back it

188
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,860
says saying this out loud is is quite

189
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,510
funny this is the quarter that was stuck

190
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,970
in my throat oh okay

191
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,680
how does that I got a Hot Wheels stuck

192
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,560
in my throat one time wait really come

193
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,120
here how did it happen bro actually I

194
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,750
was a little kid boy doesn't think make

195
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:13,350
any sense all right

196
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:15,030
you sent it bro the girl that sent us

197
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:19,490
that package got us this little rope for

198
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:22,350
Kong - he loves it bro two hours later

199
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,910
this is this is scaring me a little bit

200
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,170
I think there's only one thing to do man

201
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,150
there you go coffee see you good bro

202
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,990
survey got 150 of them just fill it out

203
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,730
let me know when it's done

204
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,650
so I feel like this is a good time to

205
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,390
bring up I bought these pillowcases in

206
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,460
the mail here they're body pillow cases

207
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,960
actually if you look at that guy that's

208
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,910
a picture of me actually and on the

209
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,320
other side just for good measure I put a

210
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,090
shirtless picture of me there's a

211
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,590
special reason I got these actually it's

212
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,300
for my roommate Evan sometimes when I'm

213
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,740
not around I know he gets lonely so I

214
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,780
figured he could put these on all his

215
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,750
pillows and just so I'm always sleeping

216
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,980
