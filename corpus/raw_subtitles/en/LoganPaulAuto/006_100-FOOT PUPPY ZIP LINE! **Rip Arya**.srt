00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,710
lay on Oh buenos so I thought there's

84
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,210
got to be a way where we can make some

85
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,070
sort of pulley system we're on the

86
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,690
balcony we have a wire run from the

87
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,669
second floor to the middle of the yard

88
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,229
and kind of just like sling Kong down

89
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:45,640
there and some sort of basket so then I

90
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,080
don't have to leave my room right like

91
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,560
it might not work Kong could die and

92
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,560
fall but

93
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:56,999
you just got home and I parked and I

94
00:04:52,599 --> 00:05:00,909

00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:02,830
bigger that's amazing I love it like

96
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:04,210

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:14,259
I'm getting distracted I'm back to the

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:16,360

100
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:18,009
bowl of cereal guys having ended here is

101
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,349

00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:46,910
running away Frank guess what I'm

120
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:50,210

121
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,509
uh you know a thing that goes under the

122
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,650
little horse you go back and forth I got

123
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:56,000
a thing that goes into the little horse

124
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:02,770
you go back and forth on building a

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,770
spaceship Oh tell me that's not perfect

126
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,690
sometimes in life these things happen

127
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,830
Joe I'm not an engineer I was majoring

128
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,570
in that before I dropped out of college

129
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,349
I'm just a vlogger boy the idea is to

130
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,910
cork this into the ground the ground to

131
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:32,810
screw this into the ground and then run

132
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:35,180
the line to the house oh it's about how

133
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,880
hard you get back how hard you get how

134
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,310
are you girls getting you for once in my

135
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,690
life I use my brain and this is leverage

136
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,240
you see this think it's actually torque

137
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:47,240
its torque is what I said bro that's in

138
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,360
their daddy movie car just as much as

139
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,780

159
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:35,839
yogi you're crazy it was nice intention

160
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,139
using the most precision accurate

161
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:50,610
engineering no gang we have concocted a

162
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:52,320
Kong pulley system Oh oh my gosh she's

163
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,240
gonna have to go slow yo just really

164
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,889
slow but look look the bucket stable bro

165
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,750
like we got four lines I'm tilting it

166
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:59,579
right now it's really hard to tilt or

167
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,959
tip any direction Kong we'll be safe in

168
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:02,430
there I'm just curious how he's gonna

169
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,990
get out of the bucket once we actually

170
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,519
get him to the ground obviously I'm not

171
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,680
a complete idiot so we're gonna do a

172
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,730
little test just calling me when I'm

173
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:15,500
