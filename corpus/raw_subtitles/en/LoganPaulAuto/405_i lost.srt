21
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,369
being a dwarf in oil they sat me in the

front row so I could see after the

23
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:51,909
second round I politely asked him if

00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:53,710
they could move me to the back i sat

25
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,869
next to your divorced parents and I

26
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,070

fire was the worst decision they ever

28
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:09,130
did together I saw Justin Bieber walked

29
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,010
out with you did you think he wrote the

30
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,620

you didn't have sex for three months

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,110
leading into the fight was that actually

35
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,090

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:08,430
some ways was this a win now it's my

45
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:13,510
turn

46
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:15,760

47
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,560

of my favorite moments of the night and

100
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,690
I said this in my win speech I I don't

101
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,610
like being a dick I'd like I'd do the

102
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,770
press conferences and I turn into this

103
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,720
like witty [ __ ] to put on a go to a

104
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,540
good show and entertain you guys I don't

105
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,140
like beef or drama and at the end of the

106
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:49,030
day ksi and I we made up we shook hands

107
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,380
in the ring and we settled it you know

108
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,330
it's weird how it took bashing each

109
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,190
other's skulls in to do that but we did

110
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,050
it yeah that was a sick moment for the

111
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,610
first time in my life when the announcer

112
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,410
told Jay Jay he's like oh is the beef

113
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,450
settled then and I remember just looking

114
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,590
at him like you look at a girl when you

115
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,390
ask her on a date and you're like

116
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,910
waiting for the answer and I was just so

117
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,550
excited when like we'd apt up and and

118
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,140
squashed it and then also Bieber came to

119
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,030
the event like Wiz Khalifa rick wob'

120
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,370
rick ross dan Bilzerian like you guys

121
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,650

122
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,510
day like call the followers not you guys

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,950
like I love you guys like the number

124
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,470
like the fact that I have a following

125
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:26,169
that all this like stuff I have money

126
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,410
friends girls like all that I'm a kid

127
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:31,390
from a town in Ohio who planned on being

128
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,550
an engineer for the rest of his life and

129
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,640
I thought that until I was 19 years old

130
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,410
I'm 24 all this has happened in five

131
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,780
years of my life like a small-town kid

132
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,830
like like Frogger almost like I'm like

133
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,690
jumping through traffic

134
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,480
I just keep making it to the next level

135
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,970
and next level and so this is so surreal

136
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,700
for me all of this is so surreal for me

137
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,680
and like Bieber came into the locker

138
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,300
room beforehand he said a prayer with us

139
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,650
and then he walked me out one of the

140
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,690
coolest things ever and his public

141
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,850
support for me is like that means the

142
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,100
world the fact that he's able to to put

143
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,630
his neck out there for me and like just

144
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,130
keep supporting me no matter what he

145
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,290
posted me on his Instagram tour twice

146
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,900
now which is crazy Bieber I [ __ ] love

147
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,760
you bro I changed my bio it's just as

148
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,460
belieber now and it's because I believe

149
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,320
I believe dude like how is any of this a

150
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:22,430
loss like what cuz I didn't get my hand

151
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,260
raised yeah yeah okay here's the new

152
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,590
think a new rule I'm making it right now

153
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:31,310
winning is for losers and losing is for

154
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,900
winners you think people would buy that

155
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,670
but yeah nah I just don't feel like a

156
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,250
loser there's a lot of content I want to

157
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,780
do around the fight like a proper

158
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,760
breakdown behind the scenes stuff that

159
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,170
happened it was quite the day like this

160
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,000
this whole training camp has been

161
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,830
absolutely crazy like I said this before

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,080
and I know it's been memed but I woke up

163
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,150
sick that day and if I'm being honest

164
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,790
completely destroyed my morale trust I

165
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:56,510
do not want to be the guy that's making

166
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:58,370
excuses but I'm gonna make excuses if

167
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,580
you guys saw the fight the whole two

168
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,980
points thing was one of them and okay

169
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,630
this is that kind of delicate and a bit

170
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,370
sensitive so I didn't like prepare

171
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,990
anything like I do for normal videos I

172
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,580
normally have like beats to hit so I'm

173
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,740
just gonna speak from the heart I asked

174
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,330
my videographer Andre to leave the room

175
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,460
because I don't know where this is gonna

176
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,850
go but you know I've been saying I I

177
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,190
don't I don't feel like I lost because I

178
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,590
really don't like I'm I'm smiling I'm

179
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,710
not like depressed I don't feel like my

180
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,630
career is over like which was the big

181
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,280
threat or like I was made into a meme

182
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,110
the only mean that happened was because

183
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,420
I said it sneeze three times so like I'm

184
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:42,200
going out I'm enjoying my life again and

185
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:44,480
every day I get passed by people I get

186
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,760
phone calls I get taxed tagged in some

187
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,380
video online that that says like y'all

188
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,020
Logan you didn't you didn't lose that

189
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,570
fight that was [ __ ] the ref made an

190
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,820
erroneous call or it was like and

191
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,720
misinterpreted by the judges I thought

192
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,920
you won the fight

193
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,620
the fight whatever just like a slew of

194
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,230
extremely one-sided opinions about the

195
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,040
outcome of the fight being 100% honest

196
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:13,910
with you I have not heard or seen one

197
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:17,209
comment not even from ksi side or like

198
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:20,000
the British fans that have said the two

199
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:22,370
points was the right call and to give

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,290
you guys some context as to why this is

201
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,269
such a big deal I'm gonna try not to get

202
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,000
like too technical with boxing scores

203
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,500
but we might have to so bear with me the

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,209
fight was a split decision the two

205
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,959
points that were deducted from me in

206
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:37,160
round four let's say he let me off with

207
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,920
a warning by the way I think he should

208
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,889
have done because he had not given me

209
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,420
any prior warnings to prior to that if

210
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:46,490
that had happened I would have won the

211
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,649
fight it would have been a split

212
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,660
decision with two judge's ruling it in

213
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,970
my favor now let's say the ref deducted

214
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,009
only one point for the tap in the back

215
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:59,060
of the head on Jay Jay it would have

216
00:09:55,009 --> 00:10:02,449
been a majority draw but the two-point

217
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,610
deduction was the reason that I full-out

218
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:09,019
split decision lost the fight to the

219
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:11,050
winner by split decision from the United

220
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,050
Kingdom

221
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:31,440
this is tricky for me because I my

222
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,030
initial reaction was and I sat with this

223
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,550
for a little bit my initial reaction was

224
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:43,170
to fight it and and contest it and you

225
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:49,620
know try my hardest to make this right

226
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:51,330
but I decided to let it go and give JJ

227
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,210
the benefit of the doubt kind of go

228
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,170
hands-off give the man his his win like

229
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,990
he deserved it

230
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,510
so fighter he's a [ __ ] warrior a true

231
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,740
animal and so I posted on Instagram

232
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,330
publicly I'm like yo Congrats to the

233
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,920
champ and so I took the back seat and I

234
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,830
was gonna let life work itself out and

235
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,380
then I'm just getting bombarded

236
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:12,630
thousands of people fans boxing fanatics

237
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,940
friends random people on the street I'm

238
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,590
driving by me in cars or it's the

239
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,140
restaurant that I'm at telling me that

240
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,090
the outcome of the fight just wasn't

241
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,940
right I did some research and the last

242
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:25,590
time two points were taken away from a

243
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,540
professional fight was like over a

244
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,280
decade ago doesn't happen a lot one of

245
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,530
the times that it happened was when Mike

246
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,210
Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ear off

247
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,710
and spit it on the floor which is one of

248
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,120
the nastiest thing that's things that's

249
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,520
ever happened in boxing and Here I am

250
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,760
getting two points deducted from me for

251
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,980
like a like a like a love tap in that I

252
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,410
was like a heat-of-the-moment just like

253
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,060
a pissed off I'm in fight mode it's one

254
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,670
of those situations where the punishment

255
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,930
just simply did not fit the crime this

256
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,220
is pretty funny this is a still of the

257
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,530
rough deducting two points and I'm

258
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,660
standing there and I know this is like

259
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,270
probably ruin the fight for me it is my

260
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,640
first professional debut to be honest

261
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:05,190
with you I have no like real ideal what

262
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,260
I'm doing and it's a six round fight you

263
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,580
know how hard it is to earn back two

264
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,500
points in a six round fight

265
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,450
assuming no one's gonna get knocked out

266
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,880
or knocked down it just put me at the

267
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:18,240
bottom of a mountain that when I looked

268
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,610
up I wasn't sure I could overcome it and

269
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,400
horrific ly I was right and Jack Reese

270
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,140
who is the ref is apparently like one of

271
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
the best the California State Athletic

272
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,020
Commission has and one of the best

273
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,550
boxing reps so I don't want to like I

274
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,970
don't want to dog the guy and I don't

275
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,019
want

276
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,939
I don't want you all to blow up his spot

277
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,040
he even said it in the locker room after

278
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:37,199
I spoke to him at length he said if he

279
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,879
if he if he's made a mistake he's down

280
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:41,009
to correct it and that's I wanted you

281
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:45,060
guys to hear this from me first my team

282
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:48,360
and I have decided to file an official

283
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:50,990
appeal for for the fight because we just

284
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,180
don't believe that the outcome was right

285
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,860
and that that is it strikes me resonates

286
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,139
with me to my core and one of my biggest

287
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,850
fears with this whole thing is being a

288
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,160
sore loser and that's why I'm making

289
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,379
this video a week after the fight is

290
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,240
because I really had to check myself and

291
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:08,819
make sure I wasn't doing this because I

292
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,449
was afraid of losing and historically

293
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:15,180
we've seen guys like I've taken big L's

294
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:17,519
massive elves by no means am i afraid of

295
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,199
losing I've in fact I welcome it because

296
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,670
it's the only way I tend to experience

297
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:27,810
growth in my life but I truthfully 100%

298
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:31,470
believe I did not lose this fight if I

299
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:33,300
am harassed and belittled for speaking

300
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,189
my mind or speaking out about something

301
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,870
that I think is right like again God

302
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,970
strike me down for doing this horrible

303
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,430
thing but I have to ask myself often in

304
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,720
my life because like I I've reached this

305
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,910
weird point where I like you too

306
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,509
nonchalant about things sometimes like I

307
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,100
just like don't give up to be honest and

308
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:53,040
at first I was definitely like this and

309
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,569
then my stomach just started turning

310
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,339
over the fact that like I don't believe

311
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:58,529
the outcome was correct on this and I

312
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,870
think if I stood by and didn't do

313
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:03,449
anything about it or at least I cry I'd

314
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,160
be I'd be way disappointed with myself

315
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:07,410
I'm making this video for two reasons

316
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,480
one to man up and say I'm doing it

317
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,009
versus standing by and you guys finding

318
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,540
out via Twitter and it becoming some

319
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:14,279
sort of meme like Logan Paul's a sore

320
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,410
loser like I'll tell you right now like

321
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,689
I just don't think I lost and I would

322
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,149
like for the outcome of this fight to be

323
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:25,649
dictated the way it should be and then

324
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:28,040
be this is a just a a plea to the

325
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,500
California State Athletic Commission I I

326
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,730
would just hope that you guys give this

327
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,809
the weight that I think it deserves

328
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:39,029
because I fear that since we aren't real

329
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,889
professional fighters it may be

330
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:43,170
overlooked but I know this means a lot

331
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,769
to me I know this means a lot to my team

332
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,959
my fur

333
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:49,019
most importantly my fans and the fans

334
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,089
that watched the great sport of boxing

335
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,160
in the event that we put on on Saturday

336
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:56,100
Andy Foster I'm talking to you man I

337
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,540
know you're a good guy and if even if

338
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:02,970
the outcome does not come back in my

339
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:06,959
favor please treat it as a normal boxing

340
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:09,089
appeal to be completely transparent with

341
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,709
you guys I have gone back and forth on

342
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,540
this video for this whole week I've been

343
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,860
losing sleep over this it's tough

344
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,429
because like I don't

345
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,259
again I don't mind losing especially to

346
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:22,259
Jay Jay like that is a worthy adversary

347
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,670
that dude is of is a G he's an animal

348
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,649
and like I said in my tweet like I

349
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,809
cannot wait to see what he does next I

350
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:30,269
wish him only the greatest success but

351
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:33,089
if I don't stand up for something that I

352
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:35,040
feel is right what kind of can man am I

353
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,230
that is not the type of man I want to be

354
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,790
it's not the type of leader I want to be

355
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,829
that's not the type of father I want to

356
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,540
be so yeah i'ma fight for for what I

357
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:44,819
believe in again I think I think I said

358
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,889
everything like I said this video is

359
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:49,499
delicate and it is just super

360
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:51,230
unfortunate a split decision and we're

361
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:53,790
back here with this with this

362
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,249
controversial wind that Jay Jay had I

363
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,809
said I was done with controversy and all

364
00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:00,179
the headlines are like open Paul

365
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:02,459
controversial split decision loss like

366
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,970
why can I just not avoid some sort of

367
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:08,790
controversy ah life dude this is a weird

368
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:11,670
one for me it is tricky this is tricky

369
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,350
regardless we put on a [ __ ] good show

370
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,809
you saw the beginning of the video like

371
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:18,360
you know I'll be alright I'll be back in

372
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:21,749
the boxing ring boxing it's where I'll

373
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,249
be in the ring pocket all right dude we

374
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:24,389
passed 20 million subscribers that's

375
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:28,799
dope but if you're not subscribed

376
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:31,529
subscribe and I'll be doing a proper

377
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,569
boxing breakdown review later and maybe

378
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:35,309
a mini doc about the day the whole day

379
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:37,319
leading up to the fight cuz it well I

380
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:38,639
mean it is it was horrible but we'll

381
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:41,819

382
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,160

383
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:48,919
stay here until I decide to stop the

384
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,919
camera from the

385
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:01,249
