00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,519
and give you that extra layer of

8
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,630
protection that you might need there's a

9
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,370
lot of people working really hard to

10
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,120
restock these so we do have more and

11
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,980

19
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,980
about the tragedy that was maverick the

20
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,500
parrot on my [ __ ] evil evil Tibetan

21
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,079
Mastiff ginger the giant ate him now his

22
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,329
legacy is preserved in cloth it's

23
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,180
actually kind of sad I am a bird guy

24
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,040
like I'm AG admit it I'm a dork bird guy

25
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,539
is equivalent to cat lady like it's

26
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,340
[ __ ] weird I'm not proud of it I

27
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,480
don't know why I just like bird so for

28
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,829
the past two months I've been looking

29
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,539
for this breed of bird I think is this

30
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,430
coolest [ __ ] bird ever it's called the

31
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,020
African Grey they're so smart they have

32
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,579
the intellect of like a five-year-old

33
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,230
and they could say up to a thousand

34
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,460
words I couldn't find one so finally I

35
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,020
took the social media you guys may have

36
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,730
seen in my Instagram I was asking like

37
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,960
does anyone know someone with an African

38
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,100
Grey one of my friends reached out

39
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,840
pointed me in the direction of this

40
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,640
family who had an African Grey and it

41
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,439
needed a home so I figured who better to

42
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,479
adopt him than the Owen one youtubing

43
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,610

feathers I'm like actually gusto it's

79
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,500
like when your dad approves your

80
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,060
girlfriend so we put his cage in this

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,290
corner and we actually kind of like the

82
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,000
location of it so I think we're gonna

83
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,470
try to find a custom cage build or to do

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,030
like a curved one right here that way

85
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,019
he'll be around people he'll be social

86
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:44,100
and everyone could see him from the

87
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:46,680
kitchen someone's jealous he's never

88
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,320
given me this much attention oh why are

89
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,030
you so jealous bro this bird can eat his

90
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,040
own ass I've been trying to do it for

91
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,049
years that's cool as you can see this

92
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,610
bird is extremely uncoordinated he looks

93
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,350
like me attempting to run in the

94
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,000
Challenger games I have never seen an

95
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,530
animal this uncoordinated but it's cause

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,650
he's still a baby we're gonna work on it

97
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:09,870
we have a lot of life training to do

98
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:14,650
[Music]

99
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:19,980
it's our first morning together are you

100
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:23,250
kidding me is he perfect or my tripping

101
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:26,170
we're having pillow talk and everything

102
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:34,330
well be honest he's a better color than

103
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:40,510
most of the girls I thought homie for

104
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:41,860
life he's been kind of jumping around on

105
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,210
the bed testing his wings a little bit

106
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,100
think if he keeps on doing this

107
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:49,180
eventually he'll be able to learn how to

108
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,220
fly look somehow this bird has become

109
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,140
what I like to call the instant homey

110
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,150
it's funny cuz with maverick you know

111
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,980
when I talked when we put subtitles but

112
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,600
since this bird will legitimately be

113
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,950
able to speak English I don't think

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,580
we'll need subtitles here's what I'm

115
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:06,070
teaching him to say [ __ ] I love

116
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,990
you was Bob yeah does it look like a

117
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,880
flying am I about to take off

118
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,890
hahaha they told me his wings were

119
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,540
clipped I think it's like half true he's

120
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:20,050
been flying around the house he's ran to

121
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:21,490
the fridge a couple times I think cuz

122
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,750
he's a baby he's been sleeping a lot

123
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,950
it's kind of funny I don't know if you

124
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,690
noticed about birds or not but when they

125
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,090
sleep they tuck one leg up and somehow

126
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,680
balance on the other but they also put

127
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,120
their head like on their back so if you

128
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,410
look from the front they can look like

129
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:42,669
they've been decapitated but don't worry

130
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:44,680
he still has a head I think oh my god he

131
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,020
almost went in the fish tank holy Sh

132
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,640
look at the fish broke they're animals

133
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:55,270
they're like a lion pack just waiting to

134
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:57,460
eat the near spirit period with the word

135
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,020
dysfunctional he's stuck dude if it's

136
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,580

00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,990
name that would make a statement a name

142
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,810
worthy of carrying on the legacy of
