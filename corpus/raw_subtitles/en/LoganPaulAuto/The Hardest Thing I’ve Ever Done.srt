00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,639
i'm laying in bed this morning and i

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,679
hear like shuffling so i look at my door

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,559
and there's someone's like throwing

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,480
something under my door

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,519
there's 52 cars all of them say paul on

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
the back but when i open the door

10
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,920
there's no one there i'm like who

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,359
did this so i go to the security footage

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,800
i check the camera and it's my boxing

13
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,320
coach milton i see him running down the

14
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,519
stairs and like hiding behind a wall

15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,039
must have been some sort of practical

16
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
joke it was kind of funny but here's

17
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,640
where he slipped up now we can literally

18
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,640
frame him for anything

19
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,880
make my heart just like so sad i'm gonna

20
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,160
