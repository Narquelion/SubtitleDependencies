2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,049
let's rewind the clock a couple years

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,820
when young naive innocent Logan is in

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,949
the sixth grade our our school had a

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,660
camping trip called Mohican and we were

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,460
there for like five days so you know we

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,199
hiked we would build fires we throw

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,640
tomahawks we found out that one of my

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,230
friends had a problem wetting the bed

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
which was kind of weird but it was

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,740
sucked even more for me because I was in

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,960
the bunk underneath him anyways this

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,250
place was all about self-discovery

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,500
now there was this one kid in our grade

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,270
who was a bit different and I don't mean

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,190
different like he was the quiet kid who

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,960
played the oboe I mean different like he

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,460
would pretend to be a dragon and run

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,789
around screeching at people before

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:52,350
school started yeah that's exactly what

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,149
it sounded like so this kid let's call

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,250
him Carlo he was a bigger kid right and

23
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,170
he was known to actually beat people up

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,620
in the bathroom so anyways every night

25
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,830
at camp bunk 13 Carl would stay up all

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,710
night he would not sleep and what's more

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,830
he was very he was very vocal about it

28
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:15,020
because the entire night from bunk 13

29
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:20,750
you would hear Carl yelling nocturnal

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:23,130
nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal

31
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,710
nocturnal and at first we were like hi

32
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,610
Carl you weird I'll go to bed but after

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,890
two to three nights of yelling nocturnal

34
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,530
nocturnal nocturnal every night we were

35
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,479
like oh [ __ ] this dude might actually be

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,430
nocturnal and then a rumor started that

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,090
one kid one night saw him talking to a

38
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,100
raccoon

39
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,259
who knows but needless to say everyone

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,360
in the cabin was losing sleep because

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,369
this kid just would not shut up at night

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,220
so picture this you got a camp full of

43
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,799
drowsy dumb sixth graders throwing

44
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,899
tomahawks and trying to identify poison

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,360
oak it was a disaster kids were getting

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,430
hit an ad with tomahawks at every turn

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,040
so one night one of the kids in our

48
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,009
cabin was over it right so he goes up to

49
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,560
Carl and he says hey Carl we all know

50
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,209
you're nocturnal and stuff but would you

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,039
mind being quiet for tonight you know

52
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,690
Jess I just want to get some sleep you

53
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,980
see though Carl must not have liked that

54
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,569
question because car

55
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:21,030
out of his bed and yes that's right up

56
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,250
Hadlock the kids lips were bleeding so

57
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,170
bad that he had to get sent home but

58
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,700
somehow ever let Carlos stay with a

59
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,370
warning that's right the kid who threw a

60
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,019
padlock at another kid's face was

61
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,720
allowed to stay and continue throwing

62
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,640
tomahawks at camp now looking back as an

63
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,500
adult I'm aware that our camp counselors

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,370
were probably like permanently on drugs

65
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,230
but I digress

66
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,510
Dave for comes around and little sixth

67
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,849
grade Logan is so far being exhausted

68
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,709
and all I want to do was find tadpoles

69
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,870
and build fires and run around and do

70
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,239
fun camp stuff but this kid car was

71
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,890
ruining it with his nocturnal [ __ ]

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,410
so one day we're walking to plant

73
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,060
identification class and Karl is added

74
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:03,750
again nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal

75
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:06,000
nocturnal nocturnal nocturnal

76
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,609
someone had to stop this madness man so

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,629
I put my foot down I sack up and I say

78
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,569
yo Karl

79
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,609
Jennifer God and for whatever reason he

80
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,440
had big double D batteries at the time

81
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,970
maybe he shoved them up his butt at

82
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,560
night that's why he was always awake and

83
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,540
cause he had energy right but anyways he

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,200
threw one of his ass batteries at me and

85
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,700
he streamed and this kid was bigger than

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,440
me at the time I didn't have muscles yet

87
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,120
so I was like damn I'm not about to

88
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,799
fight this kid and then I was like no

89
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,940
way cuz he'd probably try to fight my

90
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,919
ear off or something

91
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,480
so I did the next best thing and as karl

92
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,280
was walking in the door in front of me

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,230
I'd shut the door on him that's right I

94
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,760
tried to smush Karl in the doorframe and

95
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,540
for some reason I thought that would get

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,780
my point across but oh no Karl freakin

97
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,480
snapped in front of everyone he grabbed

98
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,090
me I grabbed him I'm like oh [ __ ] it's

99
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,190
going down I'm fighting the raccoon kid

100
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,569
I slammed him up against the wall at

101
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,430
this point everyone is like what is

102
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,379
happening the camp counselors are off

103
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,660
doing drugs somewhere in the forest it's

104
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,519
frickin chaos my forearm is on his neck

105
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,370
I got a pinned against the wall and this

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,060
dude almost instinctively [ __ ] his head

107
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:15,000
back and sinks his teeth into my arm

108
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,070
I'm like did this kid just bite me

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,979
everyone's like does that kid just bite

110
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,810
Logan I had never seen this tactic in a

111
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:23,729
fight before I was only in sixth grade I

112
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,200
didn't know what was happening so I let

113
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,040
go partially because I'm in pain and

114
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,960
partially because I think I have rabies

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,910
now but I'm like okay you wanna fight

116
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,310
dirty let's fight dirty you nocturnal

117
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,080
son of a [ __ ] so then I run that's

118
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,240
right I've run away from the table but

119
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,820
this kid is tasty he wanted to finish

120
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,800
what he started into my entire arm off

121
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,840
the whole lunchroom is watching this I

122
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,830
have had enough at this point so I give

123
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,560
my battle call I grab a chair from under

124
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,750
the table and as hard as I can throw it

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,170
at his face as he's foaming at the mouth

126
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,750
chasing me

127
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,490
right to the dome bro Carla collapses in

128
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,010
the floor and he starts screaming I'm

129
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,680
gonna get you you're gonna pay for this

130
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,300
dude's out of a [ __ ] I'm like [ __ ] bro

131
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,520
I gotta go treat my arm so I run away

132
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,140
word quickly spread and the counselors

133
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,790
decided that throwing a padlock at a

134
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,260
kid's face and shooting a hole in my arm

135
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,150
was enough to evidence the second Carl

136
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,160
home and little sixth-grade Logan was

137
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,990
hailed as the chair throwing hero

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,940
we all got a good sleep that night and

139
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,950
live Dre be free happily ever

140
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:30,370
