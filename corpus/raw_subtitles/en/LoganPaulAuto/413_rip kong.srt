3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,610
that

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,610

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,679
[Music]

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:32,379
[Music]

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,420
I just want to own this dog and their

8
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:34,989
happily forever after how much for the

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:49,860
dog

10
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:49,860
yo yo dog for 5 minutes and we are

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,859
[Music]

12
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:06,080
here we are this is it

13
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,820
I hate these videos every single one you

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,040
sit down and you talk to a camera about

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:15,290
some sesh that just happened the

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:17,180
unexpected videos but I believe I owe it

17
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,310
to you guys to talk about what happened

18
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,040
because Kong the savage as you know

19
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:25,310
played a huge part in my life these past

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,610
two years I'm gonna try not to get

21
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,430
emotional but it's just it's this was

22
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,840
very unexpected it's it's incredibly sad

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,340
everyone in the house there's their

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,680
heart is hurting today and we've heard

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,570
reports of coyotes in the neighborhood

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,610
neighbor Susie is always like texting us

27
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,410
when the the neighborhood gets an email

28
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,030
about some sort of coyote wash mitt

29
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,619
whether it's a street over or somewhere

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,570
in the city I just feel like it's one of

31
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,580
those things where it's impossible to

32
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,360
happen until it happens to you which is

33
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,759
what happened last night

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,580
I took a moment to think about how I

35
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,080
wanted to make this video obviously

36
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:01,750
because anything involving death given

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:04,220
my past is gonna be a bit tender and

38
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,670
difficult to navigate and as a content

39
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,850
creator

40
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,259
I wanted to let this one digest a bit so

41
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,340
I could really collect my feelings

42
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,709
before I drove into it

43
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,970
yesterday was a weird day in general if

44
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:16,690
you guys follow me on Instagram you

45
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:20,390
probably saw the story we're in

46
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,310
pterodactyl type bird came into my koi

47
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,230
pond and actually killed one of my fish

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,660
and didn't kill it for consumption

49
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:31,880
literally just killed the fish it's

50
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,500
almost like all these bad things happen

51
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,920
at one time I don't know what it is if

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,650
it's like a universal like queue to me

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,599
or what it is but anyways I'm at dinner

54
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,240
later that night my neighbor Susie

55
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,310
texted me and she says coyote in front

56
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,709
keep calling inside and I said where and

57
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,810
so I I screened shot this and I send it

58
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,280
to my boys who are at home Andre and

59
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,490
Mike so Andre might go out to look for

60
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,740
Kong and it's the classic group chat

61
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,810
panic where everyone's starts to freak

62
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,610
out because not only do they not hear

63
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,080
him which is unusual but they don't see

64
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,640
him running around the yard either Kong

65
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,890
just ran away before guys if you're like

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,690
oh gee lo gang you know Kong has ran out

67
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,790
the gate like three times before

68
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,620
we got a fence to stop him but he's a

69
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,270
[ __ ] like a little adventure dog so

70
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,740
who knows maybe he was somewhere in the

71
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,450
bushes or somewhere in the trees but as

72
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,890
time went on and they're sending me

73
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,540
videos of them looking for Kong I

74
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,700
started to worry a little more mind you

75
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,650
I'm at dinner I'm looking at the the

76
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,240
security cameras but it's so loud and I

77
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,150
can't really see what's going on somehow

78
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,880
I I'm at this freaking crowded

79
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,420
restaurant Beverly Hills and I'm on the

80
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,850
kick security cam footage and I see one

81
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,190
of the biggest coyotes I've ever seen in

82
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,810
my life and I'm from Ohio like I I grew

83
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,640
up around coyotes I know what they look

84
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,070
like and one of them is just stalking

85
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,410
right outside the gate just lurking and

86
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,690
you you know you heard Kong bark a

87
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,270
couple times and then I saw a second

88
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,510
coyote like equally the same size and

89
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,610
these [ __ ] are bad they are

90
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,960
aggressive they've killed dogs in our

91
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,250
neighborhood before and they're right up

92
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,080
against the gate and so I'm starting to

93
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,360
freak out I am the one in the group with

94
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,770
the level head but I'm at dinner with my

95
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
friend and I'm looking around I started

96
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,370
to get a little antsy and we're all

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,190
hoping so badly that we go outside the

98
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:17,780
gate and we just see Kong sitting atop a

99
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:22,190
dead coyote tongue hanging low chest out

100
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,930
oh I gotta kill boys but it just seemed

101
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,600
a little far-fetched and then I get the

102
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,480
call from Andre and Mike they're like yo

103
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:35,990
you got to come home we have really bad

104
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:38,330
news so I got my 30-minute drive home

105
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,040
and I'm freaking on the car and I'm

106
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,970
asking I'm like yo II like it where's

107
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,900
the body is he potentially still alive

108
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:51,440
somewhere what they do

109
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:55,580
and Andres showed me the the footage

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,880
when I got home and I can't like coyotes

111
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,460
are so slick I can't help but feel like

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:06,140
this was premeditated like this is the

113
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:09,410
most cunning abduction plan I've seen in

114
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:12,770
my days the whole thing lasted about 10

115
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:15,080
to 15 seconds the coyote jumped the

116
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,780
fence Shay's Kong around a car and

117
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,050
grabbed him actually right here the

118
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,720
coyote took Kong there there's

119
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,710
no remains like they straight-up

120
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,440
abducted him

121
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,920
and like I said like these [ __ ] are

122
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,920
so

123
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:45,639
man I don't like not like this I hate

124
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:49,510
making these videos he didn't stand a

125
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:52,630
chance and I hate how naive he is and so

126
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,280
mindless like he had no idea what was

127
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,199
going on like he was on the other side

128
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,000
of the gate literally barking at the

129
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,250
Coyotes taunting them and he's never

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,590
really had any taste of danger he

131
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,580
doesn't have any predators here so we

132
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,550
didn't know what we didn't know what to

133
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,070
do and again I just want to iterate how

134
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,180
how quick all of this happened and so we

135
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,770
searched the whole neighborhood for

136
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,500
about an hour we spent the whole morning

137
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,080
looking for anything we could find and

138
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,060
there is nothing there's literally no

139
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,280
sign of him and these coyotes are still

140
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,280
out there and we still have more pets

141
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,320
like we have Perl the pig we have Raya

142
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,789
I mean if give one snuck into my room we

143
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,250
got maverick and who knows what these

144
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:31,840
these things are capable of at this

145
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,280
point you know they pulled the [ __ ]

146
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,030
heist of a century they literally

147
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,940
snagged the most famous and loved dog on

148
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:42,520
Instagram I have had Kong since almost

149
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,120
since I like started vlogging and during

150
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,830
our search last night by the grace of

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,860
Mother Nature the universe some sort of

152
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:53,919
magical ether we go and in mind you I'm

153
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,440
gonna show you he was he was literally

154
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,729
snatched right over there and right

155
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,750
there when we're looking for him

156
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:05,500
yesterday we find a little tennis ball

157
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:07,860
little chewed up tennis ball and this do

158
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,099
you see is this like real life right now

159
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:15,699
it's seriously says Kong it's obviously

160
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:17,560
the brand but this was the last thing

161
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:20,470
this is the last thing he was playing

162
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,050
with and it was like his this is his

163
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,770
final note goodbye and it was just his

164
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,770
his name

165
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:37,759
Khanh I wish you would have given me a

166
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:40,289
little more to work with here ah [ __ ] I

167
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:45,029
don't think it's fully set in yet that

168
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:46,949
he's gone I'm so used to him waking all

169
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:49,949
of us up at 7 a.m. and peeing on my

170
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:52,800
floors and licking my fingers until they

171
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,379
dry up crack and bleed a little tongue

172
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,650
that little stupid little tongue is way

173
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,149
too long for its own good I think

174
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:04,409
something needs to be done about the

175
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:05,819
coyote problem in our neighborhood some

176
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:06,689
sort of protection because this is

177
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,279
getting ridiculous

178
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:11,819
like I'm not the only one in this

179
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:14,669
neighbor who's lost a dog I just can't

180
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,409
believe like what the why me thank you

181
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:20,099
