00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,659
going a certain speed so we're gonna

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,040

u-turn and that's like thanks yeah I

62
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,670

63
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,670
waist

64
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,600
a TV still suck yeah we have no choice

65
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,790
we have to jump them seems legit yeah

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,860
built that myself so the plan is to just

67
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,690
pick up a heaps of speed and kind of

68
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,460
just hope that each wheel hits the

69
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,260
respective ramp the issue is you know

70
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,850
what we can use some duct tape hey dad

71
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,920
we have duct tape so since these aren't

72
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,860
like all like together I figure we'd

73
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,510
like tape them together and then love

74
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,210
your input on this we're just gonna kind

75
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,640
of Huck it over the ramp it's a good

76
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,790
plan with this extra added layer of

77
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,130
protection and safety a new high schools

78
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,080

109
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:48,999
entire room my office is now the

about to show you guys but first we are

112
00:05:50,499 --> 00:06:05,949
missing one thing involving this is the

113
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:07,329
final addition to the game room I've

114
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,919
been waiting for this moment literally

115
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:21,819
I've been pushing I've been stalling the

116
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:23,289
stream yeah of the room I'm colorblind

117
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,639
you guys are gonna know we're talking

118
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:29,499
about in a second but I feel like it

119
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,709
really affects orange we're good yeah

120
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,709
we're good

121
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:37,089
yeah you guessed it I may be a

122
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:41,939
colorblind but I can't see that the

123
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:43,989
carpet is orange custom designed

124
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:47,469
specifically to match this room bro

125
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:50,579
actually you know what I didn't design I

126
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:50,579
just treat the color bro

127
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,010
to make it look like it's yellow I mean

128
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,480
it works no it does no I think it does

129
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,169
because the room the room has the yellow

130
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,600
scheme

131
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:17,570

183
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:37,230
here okay yeah they look good I yeah you

184
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,700
guys can see we got graphics like stream

185
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,590
starting soon and then when we go to

186
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,900
stream yo what's good it's your boy oh

187
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,610
but he was black oh this is so exciting

188
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,430
for me when I start something new and

189
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,660
dive into it I don't know if that's

190
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,430
gonna happen but that's obviously the

191
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,200
goal so yeah we about to light and then

192
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,060
check it we got a camera on the big TV

193
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,680
as well in the back there you can go so

194
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:02,910
when we win right into a wide angle and

195
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:04,980
the whole time like I said the idea is

196
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,480
once if I lose of course we go to the

197
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,520
gameplay angle here and then I get up

198
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,750
I'm angry right you know make a weapon

199
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,820
of choice we're gonna start off this
