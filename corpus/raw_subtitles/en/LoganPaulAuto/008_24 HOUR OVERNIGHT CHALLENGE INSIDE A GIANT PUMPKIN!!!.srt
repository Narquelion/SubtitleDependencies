00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,890
no one on YouTube has ever done this

278
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,840

280
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,170
like it's not crazy late maybe like 10

281
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,420
10 p.m. and I've been out here for a

282
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,310

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,900
Z's right now I probably wake up in the

284
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,430
middle of the night just because like

285
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,660
I've been in scenarios like this before

286
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,530
we were like in a tight spot something

287
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,270
that's not the most comfortable thing

288
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:04,010
but you like to force yourself so your

289
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,920
body just naturally like wakes up out of

290
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,460
discomfort oh snap try to get

291
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,279
comfortable

292
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,649
oh okay this isn't bad it's it's also

293
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,750
much warmer than I expected it to be

294
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:16,010
we even got extra room like I could have

295
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,620
