bought them three years ago for forty

23
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,820
five thousand dollars each and I pretty

24
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,920
much hate myself for that because

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,479
spending $90,000 on the couch is [ __ ]

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,130

27
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,140
disappoint their next owner so we put
