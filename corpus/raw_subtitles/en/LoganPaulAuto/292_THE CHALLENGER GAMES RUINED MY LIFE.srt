184
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,370
the rest of this this day I mean your

185
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,050
relay team like you said but just just

186
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:40,330
watching rooting for Jake now I hate to

187
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:46,809
say but I think so

188
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:46,809
[Music]

189
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,480
Logan i-i've never been more saddened by

190
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,610
an apparent injury you came out the gate

191
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,290
you looked immediately like a robot just

192
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,060
sucks man it just sucks I'm disappointed

193
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,080
but to be honest this event is not about

194
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,910
me it's about charity it's about

195
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,020
donating to the Special Olympics and I

196
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,910
think we're still doing a great job of

197
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,200
that and it's really it's really under

198
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,680
taming like I'm really enjoying watching

199
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
these races

200
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,080

201
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,240

00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:48,610

203
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:57,160

204
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:59,500
did with your leads like gold fast

205
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,440
asleep bro I really feel like Lo is

206
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:10,870
gonna be the reason we lose bro it's the

207
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:14,920
opposite okay okay is that quick I mean

208
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,389
quick enough maybe if I get this w you

209
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,709

210
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,230
though bro

211
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,850
you can blow them away and they're off

212
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,100
raka raka actually with it's unclear

213
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,269
who's leading right now but lane seven

214
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,860
looks like they're pulling out in front

215
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:33,279
big time come subarray for the handoff

216
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:36,660

entertainer on the planet and Charlie

228
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:58,239
Jordan she was gonna clean up that's why

229
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:07,199
I put her on my four by one team even

230
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:11,169
though we long as the fastest

231
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:16,259
entertainer on planet earth makes some

232
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:16,259
noise for your gold medal winner destroy

233
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,759
[Music]

234
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,749
thank you guys for joining us right here

235
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,910
in the 2019 Challenger games thank you

236
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:32,579
guys for joining us for a very special

237
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,779
event this has been the Challenger games

238
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:37,089
2019 we'll see you next time

239
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,800
that a mad star yet a rough race

240
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:42,850
whenever I start in a plastic chair for

241
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,220
four half hours have a drink of water

242
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,749
nothing I was treated like somebody I

243
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,730
was fasting and some sort of hindu

244
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:51,579
ritual here we are Rebecca so the

245
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:54,999
problem was I shouldn't have ran on it

246
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:57,910
at all but my pride and my ego a little

247
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:59,199
bit was sort of affected and I was

248
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,649
embarrassed and I wanted to at least

249
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,059
complete the race and so I did I ran

250
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:06,519
sort of the hundred meter dash and

251
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:08,050
phousi actually carried me I'm sure you

252
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:13,059
guys saw across the finish line which

253
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:16,720
was awesome but I think the real problem

254
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:19,420
was me trying to run the relay with

255
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,759
summer Charlie and Jake and hopping down

256
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,290
100 meters just like hold and reap old

257
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,029
and reap old and then next thing you

258
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,550
know slowly but surely turning into

259
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:29,019
Thanos but everyone got hurt at the I

260
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,939
made a list here the Challenger games

261
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:33,459
literally just collected hamstrung King

262
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:36,399

264

266
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,170
getting one of the hundred meter mens he

267
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:45,819
three people in this same race got hurt

268
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,949
like just ridiculous we're all right

269
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,209
we're getting tools for this next year I

270
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:50,439
don't think the Challenger games are

271
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,449
gonna be a track-and-field me it's gonna

272
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:54,009
be a different type of epic event so

273
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:55,899
comment below what you want to see think

274
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:58,660
like maybe American Ninja Warrior think

275
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:00,879
like gladiator type war a nice friendly

276
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,709
harmless game of golf with that said

277
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,179

278
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:07,019
