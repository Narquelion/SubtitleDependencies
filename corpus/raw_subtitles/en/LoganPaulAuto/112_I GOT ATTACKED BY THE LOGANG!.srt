morning my birthday

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,179
what's up hi it was my birthday so we

43
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,189
just want to come to Yosemite and we got

44
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:09,129
here like 4:00 a.m. and this was empty

45
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:11,140
so we just kind of you right so a couple

46
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:14,400
of issues with that everyone who wanted

47
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:16,360
to camp wherever they felt like it did

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
there's that there's the fact that you

49
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,760
took up how many spots we're looking at

50
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,340
five spots

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,810
we'll just cuz it's a bus so like I

52
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,819
didn't know where else to do it you so

53
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,830
do you think that because it's a bus

54
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:29,110
that this is probably not the best place

55
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,310
to put it be considering now y'all are

56
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,310
blocked in I had the hunch

57
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,800
you know we getting ticketed bro I don't

58
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,720

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,230
park but I just don't like it but times

61
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:46,700

62
00:02:45,230 --> 00:03:07,400
this would happen much earlier but we

63
00:02:46,700 --> 00:03:09,530
