telling me I'm just a big big child

115
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,890
I'm not a big big shot you yeah I'm a

116
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,720
big choice dude for sure

117
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,790
look here's the thing importance okay

118
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,200

119
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:49,730
big cage right okay I'm a film this

120
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,230

saying this is actually I like this

124
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,620
lesson I think balance in life is

125
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,450
important so while I'm able to act like

126
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,130
a kid and have fun and do the pranks and

127
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,560
jokes and stuff at the same time I can

128
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,630
flip the switch and become an adult and

129
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,280
sign my papers and do my business stuff

130
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,810
cuz I'm sure as you guys know like when

131
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,830
we shut the camera off a lot goes on

132
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,660
behind the scenes as far as

133
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,700
conceptualization goes the actual

134
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,310
running of the Maverick Enterprise it's

135
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,410
a lot so Judy I can be an adult
