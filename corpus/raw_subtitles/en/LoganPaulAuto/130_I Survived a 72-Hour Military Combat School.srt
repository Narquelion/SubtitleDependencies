of high profile FBI military work

54
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,330
Wikipedia describes him as an excellent

55
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,460
terrorist hunter unfortunately for me

56
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,710

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,370
somebody who is combat ready I think

66
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,260
Logan Paul is physically in good shape

67
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,750
he has the potential to make it through

68
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,670
this course and do great I don't think

69
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,430
he's going to its physical challenge

70
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,350

71
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,200

yeah we got the sand and we got the

191
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,890
water oh because you just took a bite of

192
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,390
that burger well not no way we're

193
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,600
supposed to have a nice David David

194
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:42,519
bendeth our respective sand water and

195
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:44,320
you're gonna do two laps Logan Paul when

196
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,180
he came here this morning was concerned

197
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,829
about Logan Paul was concerned about

198
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,260
himself he was talking about how he had

199
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:57,970
the flu and that's what was defeating

200
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:59,740
him on the first run it was physically

201
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,380
challenging but that's not what did it

202
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,720
do him it was all mental but when you've

203
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,570
been through difficult things physically

204
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:15,190
it alters what you think you're capable

205
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:17,529
of you know everything so our strategy

206
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,690
going forward based on what we saw in

207
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:21,160
that last run of Logan we're gonna take

208
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,839
it up another notch there are more

209
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,920
things yet that he hasn't done that will

210
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:30,250
be incorporated into what he's just done

211
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:33,960
how's it possible that I miss ya it must

212
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:58,180
be different for you nice toss top bro

213
00:11:33,960 --> 00:12:00,460
ready for it yep it was tough at the

214
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,950
beginning for Logan it got easier

215
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:07,200
towards the middle now comes to the end

216
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,200
and the end there's gonna be way harder

217
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:21,400
what do you got what do you got in that

218
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,400
window

219
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,800

220
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,930
together right we learn how to shoot we

221
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,070
learn how to do the obstacle course

222
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,450
hopefully it goes well

223
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,010
something tells me it's not though this

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,140
vest is like at least probably a hundred

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,910
pounds this gun is probably 300 pounds

226
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,740
just a lot of extra added weight to my

227
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,630
body that is gonna make this extremely

228
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,130
extremely difficult there's nothing I

229
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,300
