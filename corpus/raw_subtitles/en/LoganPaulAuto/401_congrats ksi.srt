1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:06,660
hey everybody

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,220
it's me YouTube's bad boy I know I need

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,750
to shave my beard I know I look like a

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,809
homeless man I know I've been gone for a

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,990
while but I'm back with bad news um my

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,520
appeal got denied I can't say I did not

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,430
see this coming and for those of you who

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,900
do not know my appeal I appealed the two

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,210
points that the ref took away from me

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,880
and my boxing fight against ksi which is

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,490
the reason I lost so ksi has officially

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,730
without a question or doubt won the

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,170
fight against me you know it's not great

14
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,719
I mean you know if I'm being honest it

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,520
stings I hate to lose it mostly stings

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,340
though because I shot myself in the foot

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,290
like I quite literally only lost because

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,670
of my actions shoutout to Andy Foster in

19
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,890
the California State Athletic Commission

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,450
for giving this the due diligence that I

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,789
think it deserved but even they said in

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,899
their denial of the appeal I followed

23
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,250
some of your comments in social media

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,719
and you stated that you don't feel like

25
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,129
you lost or something to that effect

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,289
this may be because you won the rounds

27
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,609
with points by two judges you lost this

28
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,050
boxing contest due to the files

29
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,609
committed in the subsequent point

30
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,080
deduction ksi won the match under the

31
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,790
rules of the Commission you were ahead

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,119
on two cards thank you for the chapstick

33
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,700
Danny

34
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,340
but ksi won the net points due to point

35
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:16,350
deductions from the PUF productions from

36
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:19,860
the files you committed just yet another

37
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,380
case of like literally it's I took an L

38
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,210
in life only because of me and I even

39
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,710
said this before the fight I understood

40
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,880
that case I was in the ring with me but

41
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,650
the only person I was really fighting

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,840
against was myself and I lost that fight

43
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,759
so I'm optimistic for the day where I

44
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,560
can stop being my own worst enemy and

45
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,710
become my biggest supporter because once

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,060
again I've shot myself in the foot you

47
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,310
know it's disappointing but I'll move on

48
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,810
I'll live and I will be fighting again

49
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,030
and next time hopefully I don't make

50
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,840
myself lose the fight so ksi congrats

wanted to show you guys or tell you guys

88
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,550
what I was thinking on the night of the

89
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,020
fight I knew if I don't make this video

90
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,130
now I probably never will and for

91
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,680
everyone wondering what it's like to

92
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,720
compete in what might be the biggest

93
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,040

94
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,200
professionally for the first time in

95
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,550
front of like what like 15,000 people at

96
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,140
the Staples Center it's absolutely

97
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,430
insane also there's some things that

98
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,540
we're going through my head that you

99
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,739
definitely didn't know about that I'm

100
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,090
gonna tell you about now and just kind

101
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,120
of iterate my thoughts so I go to do my

102
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,489
ring walk Bieber's behind me but somehow

103
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,080
he gets like drowned out because every

104
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:29,489
everyone's so tight it's such like a

105
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
tight walkway and I'm trying to like

106
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,610
stay focused but at one point I'm

107
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,140
literally almost walking sideways not to

108
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,519
mention if you look in my eyes you can

109
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,140
pretty much see death I'm sick as

110
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,239
[ __ ] like under my eyes like blue and

111
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,060
purple ksi does his ring walk he's got

112
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,769
this big big red cloak and a face mask

113
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,510
he's got you can barely see him I'm

114
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,920
literally out here first professional

115
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,600
boxing match representing my country

116
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,000
wearing red white and blue and I'm

117
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,220
getting hella goosebumps and also

118
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,989
wondering how the [ __ ] am I about to

119
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,269
pull this off given the fact that I can

120
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,980
barely breathe this is super telling

121
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,690
right here and I didn't see him at this

122
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,970
point but just looking back right here

123
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,220
it's so obvious to me that he was in the

124
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,480
zone like my man is in flow state he's

125
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,470
focused he's locked and he's even

126
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,000
talking to himself right now

127
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,290
it looks like he's saying I want this I

128
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,209
want this and I've always said this

129
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,510
about ksi the dude just like he's got

130
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,829
this like sick mental toughness that

131
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,870
probably contributes to a lot of his

132
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,519
success and his success on this night

133
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,770
but this man just wanted it and look

134
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,960
it's just evident how focused he is so

135
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,400
they bring us to the center and I'm

136
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,810
definitely locked in it I'm not not

137
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,220
focused like I'm

138
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,540
looking at his body I'm trying to figure

139
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,950
out where I'm gonna pick my shots and

140
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,750
where I'm gonna hit him and then this is

141
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,730
it dude this is the big moment months

142
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,550
and months of talking the first fight

143
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,440
was a draw this is the moment that the

144
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,270
whole entire world has been waiting for

145
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,850
and then I just went I can let everyone

146
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,350
down I was just kidding not really

147
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,410
anyway robbed one who's the king of

148
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,919
social media man comes off jabbing right

149
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,930
away

150
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,730
he keeps jabbing at my body he lands a

151
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,650
couple good ones trying to feel each

152
00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:01,740
other out a little bit right there that

153
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,090
he throws a big big overhand right which

154
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,350
by the way is what we trained for we

155
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,690
know that's his that's his bread and

156
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,150
butter punch and it misses and and as

157
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,790
soon as it missed I realized that not

158
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,830
much really has changed with his

159
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,660
fighting style last year I had one hand

160
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,280
down that was fought with my hands down

161
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,440
and this year you know I'm a little more

162
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,639
up a little more like cat-like ready to

163
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,440
take on punches but he was still

164
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,389
throwing these big wild punches which i

165
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,669
think is actually why he got tired much

166
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:30,720
quicker than I did finally these two can

167
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:33,060
get it on faking a little bit and he

168
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,470
keeps throwing in my body which made me

169
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,150
think he was he was setting something up

170
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,410
a little bit and yeah just getting a

171
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,250
little scuffle here I'm trying to hit

172
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,250
his kidneys in his liver

173
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,050
again just can't side with them with the

174
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,640
big overhand right not much is really

175
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,500
happening here this again this round was

176
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,630
kind of slow but I gotta say it's crazy

177
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,910
this is my first time actually watching

178
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,690
the fight in full and it is crazy to see

179
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:00,240
how packed this arena is just watching

180
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:05,639
two youtubers beat the [ __ ] out of each

181
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,950
other I knew that when I would throw

182
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,169
case I would throw too so I was a little

183
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,180
hesitant to use my right hand cuz every

184
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,530
time I did he would go crazy and I'm not

185
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,880
really an emotional fighter on more

186
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:20,010
strategic so I didn't want to get caught

187
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,950
with some stupid yeah I mean this dude

188
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,240
is everywhere it's like you you you go

189
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,650
for something and he just starts

190
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,650
flinging his arms everywhere

191
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,120
yeah so I was while I was looking for

192
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,070
that check hook a lot and he managed to

193
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,950
avoid it but uh I got close a couple

194
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:40,600
times it's clear to me that ksi is

195
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:43,210
getting tired and to be honest I like

196
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,060
that I like that but yeah it's the end

197
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,620
of the first round and I noticed he was

198
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,790
breathing heavy and in the press

199
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,010
conferences he was talking about how

200
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,930
hard he worked and I did that last year

201
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,300
I worked incredibly hard but I was

202
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,250
cognizant that he might have over

203
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,200
trained and I think he did cuz he got

204
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,400
tired after like three rounds and I

205
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,960
think you start to see it there but he

206
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,550
definitely won that round for sure he

207
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,990
was more active than I was before the

208
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,610
fight actually I told my team I was like

209
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,710
hey guys I have to start slow like I

210
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,510
need my adrenaline to kick in probably

211
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,370
around like around 2 or 3 because I just

212
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,050
I don't feel good and I'm not gonna be

213
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,820
able to like go hard right off the bat

214
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,840
so ya know first around the cavitation

215
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,640
Braun 2 begins kind of the same old like

216
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,740
still figuring each other out I'm still

217
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:31,060
slow I'm using my jabs sometimes and I

218
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:31,690
connected a couple really good ones this

219
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,290
boy

220
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:37,270
swings who big punches and he shows them

221
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,710
so they're pretty easy to dodge but I'm

222
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,520
telling you if he hits me with one of

223
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,870
those you know my head's flying off so

224
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,150
just a little jab there let him know I'm

225
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:50,740
still here like don't another jab to the

226
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:52,030
face another jab my friends made fun of

227
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,560
me that in for my right hand in there

228
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,880
and watching back there absolutely right

229
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,770
like I'm literally only using my left

230
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,090
hand so I'm aiming for the body right

231
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,240
now kind of tricking him and then a nice

232
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,740
jab to the head and like I said I landed

233
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,450
a lot of jabs in this fight there's a

234
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,280
lot of pictures that came out of his

235
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,380
face just like crumpled up and my left

236
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,270
hand just planted right in his noggin I

237
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,870
just wish I would have done that with my

238
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,400
right hand

239
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,320
no I'm saying so it's starting to heat

240
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,270
up a little bit again I'm just I'm jab

241
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,190
central just jab as much as I possibly

242
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:21,150
can cuz it's like I'm still waiting for

243
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,150
my body to wake up

244
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,790
[Music]

245
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:31,719
bro I'm barely barely missing these

246
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:33,639
punches which is my style I'm a counter

247
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,199
puncher kind of and so when I slip or

248
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:39,180
move I'm purposely like you're missing

249
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:39,180
me by like this much watching it back

250
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,910
announcer set it right there I know I

251
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:47,889
know he keeps throwing these wild

252
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,680
punches and I don't care who you are you

253
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:52,420
cannot do that for six for six to twelve

254
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:58,300
rounds he's not using his energy well

255
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:59,800
and I see he's getting tired that's true

256
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,829
I'm a believer now it's in my Instagram

257
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,180
bio Thank You Justin I love you bro so

258
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:06,189
in the replay yeah check that out that's

259
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,259
it just that just to just two real good

260
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:09,819
jabs and a third one and then we're just

261
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:13,839
it's just a swing fest

262
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:15,160
and then this punch right here that was

263
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,649
the first punch where I was like I was

264
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,259
like ah ten ounce gloves no head guards

265
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:27,160
I see round three starts this is where

266
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:29,350
it gets interesting case I just missing

267
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,480
punch I could see him running out of

268
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,880
energy he's breathing heavier that was

269
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,490
weird he looked to his coaches for some

270
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,930
reason which I've never seen any boxer

271
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,970
do in the middle of the round he just

272
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,250
like looked at his coaches and I don't

273
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,750
know why I didn't like punch him in the

274
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,040
face but it was also like a body

275
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,720
language thing like it was a sign of

276
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,550
retreat and assignment that he was

277
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,110
exhausted and even like he's against the

278
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,899
ropes and everything I like I literally

279
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,459
hate myself for not capitalizing on that

280
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,350
I know I got in trouble for the foul

281
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:58,509
later but this kid kept hitting me in

282
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,009
the back of the head when we would lock

283
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:04,990
up and here was the ears I think one of

284
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:06,759
the first time she did it like just

285
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,829
laying in the back a head so I tell the

286
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,759
ref Jack Reese I'm like yeah hit he hits

287
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:12,009
me in the back of the head and his

288
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,899
response was in hindsight completely

289
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,910
[ __ ] inappropriate and Jack Reese I

290
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:19,569
want you to know bro I'm not happy with

291
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,790
you that's wrong it at all oh yeah he

292
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:23,439
yells he yells at me in the middle of my

293
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,250
the biggest event of my life he goes

294
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:27,370
relax

295
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,500
did he kill you I got you relax box he's

296
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,029
D treated it like two youtubers fighting

297
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,709
instead of like a typical boxing match

298
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,850
but anyways I'm being a whiny [ __ ]

299
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:39,579
let's watch

300
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:41,769
not looking too good here okay so right

301
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:43,600
here right here yes I swings in me and

302
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,040
then he swings again and he hits me like

303
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,079
kind of in the back of the head and I

304
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,550
grab his legs and he pulls back and I'm

305
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,959
on the floor it looks like I'm about to

306
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,190
take him down and obviously this has

307
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,500
never happened to me before

308
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,300
so I look up at Jack Reese oh my god was

309
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,680
that a knockdown I'm not really sure and

310
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,269
he's like no get out cuz like I was

311
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,519
waiting for him to start counting but he

312
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:02,139
did it and I got up and I was fine but I

313
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,589
was just sort of confused at what just

314
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:06,040
happened

315
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:07,569
knuckle I am I'm holding a lot did

316
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,130
boxing boxing is tough for me dude I got

317
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:10,779
it I said I still have a lot to learn in

318
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,759
boxing I'm just like an MMA guy and I

319
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:14,649
think my wrestling background lends

320
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,449
itself really nicely to just like

321
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,819
clinching people so as round 3 is coming

322
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:20,199
to a close KS eyes movements are getting

323
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:24,880
a little slower he's breathing heavier

324
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:27,940
he's not punching as fast and then it's

325
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,250
live this happens in practice all the

326
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,350
time I have long legs I took a step too

327
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,540
far back and there was nothing I was off

328
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,790
the the mat but yeah round 3 is clearly

329
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,579
not not a great round for me so check it

330
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,110
out I get to the corner

331
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,699
Shannon cook you can see he goes he goes

332
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,439
what are you doing I'm like what the

333
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,209
[ __ ] are you doing and I tell him I'm

334
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:48,160
like I don't know I just still like

335
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:49,329
wasn't quite present but I knew he was

336
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,769
tired and I knew I was gonna have to

337
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:52,720
capitalize now so yeah this was the

338
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:54,130
knockdown yeah he got me like in the

339
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,100
back of the head and I sort of grabbed

340
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,800
him it's so funny I go I go immediately

341
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,720
back to my wrestling roots yeah I'm

342
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,639
actually to be honest to be surprised

343
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,199
that Jack Reese did not count that as a

344
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,620
knockdown you know I'm not the ref but

345
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:10,029
also like like I'll um I don't know how

346
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,230
you make that mistake all right

347
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,899
the controversial round for

348
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,819
[Applause]

349
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:18,740
you know in the corner nothing wrong

350
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:21,170
with it ah that was literally I think

351
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,029
the first right hand that I threw in

352
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,379
this fight it took me four rounds to

353
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,850
throw one right hand

354
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:27,350
anyways I can tell JJ's getting a little

355
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,649
sloppy with it he's getting a little

356
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,209
tired he throwing lazy punches lazy jabs

357
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,860
okay so right now I'm setting him up and

358
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:37,579
I'm waiting for him to do something dumb

359
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:42,499
and he does right there connect with a

360
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:45,410
beautiful uppercut and then k scy gets

361
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:47,329
up he stumbles to the corner he's

362
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,279
complaining cuz I I had tapped him in

363
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:51,230
the back of the head Jack Reese he

364
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,029
brings me to the neutral corner and yeah

365
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,290
this this is this is was the most

366
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,779
beautiful uppercut thrown that night

367
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,639
just like absolutely devastating and I

368
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:00,860
and I have done this in practice a lot

369
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,679
you slip a jab and come underneath and

370
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,119
that one connected my left hand was like

371
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,069
happened to be around his neck because I

372
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:08,360
think I threw a hook that failed and I

373
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,949
just kept it there and then hit him

374
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,480
again with our uppercuts which by the

375
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:12,920
way that's like a legal punch we've seen

376
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,480
in boxing it's probably not it's

377
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,679
probably frowned upon but if you do it

378
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,269
like once in the heat of the moment like

379
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:21,050
this I shouldn't be penalized for it

380
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:23,029
this is the one he goes down and he's

381
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,929
like still on my legs so I tap him in

382
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,819
the back of the head

383
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:29,779
it wasn't crazy hard but still I did it

384
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:31,759
and yeah that did that quite literally

385
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:33,649
is what cost me the fight so Jack Freese

386
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,920
tells me he's waving it off and and by

387
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:40,790
the way when he does I'm I I I'm I see

388
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:44,629
JJ recovering sucking air and I also saw

389
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,300
him get up and stumble to his corner

390
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:49,730
like this was my opportunity and I know

391
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,259
time is ticking he's probably still not

392
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:54,399
quite present and this would have been

393
00:13:51,259 --> 00:14:04,879
my opportunity to to finish him off but

394
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:06,889
yeah myself two points Jack Reese the

395
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,870
ref is apparently one of the best in the

396
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,529
game but uh you know quite honestly I

397
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,999
beg to differ

398
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,980
Jack I'm sure you're a great guy but you

399
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:14,190
missed ksi is knocked down earlier and

400
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,790
this two points thing was

401
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,440
[Music]

402
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,880
I know you're a realtor bro and I want

403
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,650
you to know I will never be buying a

404
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,030
house from you yeah so the fight the

405
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,880
fight picks up again and and to be

406
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:28,280
honest with you I should have gone balls

407
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,560
to the wall here I know for a fact case

408
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,080
I was not fully recovered and for some

409
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,670
reason I was still holding back I will

410
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,290
quite literally never forgive myself for

411
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,540
the rest of my life for not just

412
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,250
unleashing on him yeah you could tell

413
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,480
like his movement he's just he keeps

414
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:48,410
walking back and back and back and uh

415
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:55,070
girl yeah bro this uppercut oh boy you

416
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:56,870
got [ __ ] up oh my god I just have a

417
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,970
problem with okay so boxing right it's a

418
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,710
fight but also not really there's some

419
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,980
rules there's a lot of things you can't

420
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,570
do which is why I truly believe I I need

421
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,810
to do MMA so you know Dana White

422
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,510
Bellator the zone set it up here we go

423
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,620
so round five starts you can see I'm

424
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,940
picking up the pace a little bit and

425
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,380
throw some more punches but still not

426
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,850
enough not like I should be and my

427
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,890
conditionings pretty good to be honest

428
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,600
with you like I'm okay

429
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:25,640
I noticed he's tired and he's probably

430
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:29,510
still not really 100% there whew jab jab

431
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:31,490
jab okay aside with the big punches he's

432
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,070
missing I know he's getting tired and at

433
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,840
this point it's hard for me to get over

434
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,520
the mental mountain that the two points

435
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,260
were taken away like that really me up

436
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,150
which is a lesson for me like I can't

437
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,680
let I can't even if an obstacle is

438
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,110
thrown in my path and you think I know

439
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,070
this by now I can't let it get to me and

440
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,800
I still got to keep fighting

441
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:52,870
yes sir round 5 ends sorta uneventful

442
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,870
we're at around 6 the championship round

443
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,730
so yeah in the corner before the the six

444
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,990
round

445
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,370
Shannon's telling me he's saying yo you

446
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,540
want to go home tired and he told me

447
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,370
this in the locker room too no matter

448
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,260
what happens tonight go home tight don't

449
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,209
go home with energy know that you you

450
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:14,329
left it all out there in the ring and to

451
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:18,200
be honest with you I didn't and I don't

452
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:20,240
know why because it's so unlike me to to

453
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,390
half-ass something but quite literally I

454
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,910
was half-assing this fight this is one

455
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,430
of two moments in my life where I felt

456
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,810
like I was watching my life happen like

457
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,000
a movie and there was nothing I could do

458
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,310
about it like an out-of-body experience

459
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,450
almost last round championship round

460
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:40,100
round six do we get the stoppage it well

461
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,570
just start swinging for the fences it's

462
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,850
crazy we both know we gotta activate

463
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,410
pretty solid in the money that punch

464
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,240
right there I remember it was it was a

465
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,430
body shot and I really liked that punch

466
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,769
it's a hook to the body but I remember

467
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,120
it connected he goes kind of like I did

468
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:56,529
last year but he did a good job of

469
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,529
hiding it I know I know he felt that one

470
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:02,240
see this is like right there it's clear

471
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,290
that ksi just he wants it more that's

472
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,910
all there is to it that's what it came

473
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,540
down to like we're both moderately good

474
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,790
at boxing

475
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,880
we're both we both got massive egos but

476
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,439
this night on November 9th case I wanted

477
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,140
the win more than I did so there's about

478
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,610
10 seconds left in the fight you know we

479
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,419
both just kind of like start lazily

480
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:22,480
swinging holding each other waiting for

481
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:26,860
it to be over and then

482
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:32,960
he's gonna have to do it bell rings

483
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:34,550
round six is over and I I knew I didn't

484
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,260
have it to be honest with you I looked

485
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,300
at Jake and I was like yo he he won that

486
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,790
one right and he's like nah man you did

487
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,680
great I was like yeah but he met he won

488
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:47,390
it and he was being weird with me and so

489
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:49,370
like oh look watching this fight right

490
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,800
now even is making me extremely hungry

491
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,470
and like people warned me about the

492
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:57,380
dangers of boxing but like I really do

493
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,140
love the sport and I unfortunately I

494
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,940
can't end on a loss so I mean whoever

495
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,740
wants this smoke who could come get it

496
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,440
in case I is a tricky person to fight

497
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,360
because it's it's hard to train for

498
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,070
someone who doesn't really have any

499
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,010
technique he's just got a big heart

500
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:22,100
Logan wall so the one judge had me

501
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:24,210
winning by one point another judge had

502
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:29,309
ksi winning

503
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:40,980
scores the contest 5655 and the last

504
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:43,529
judge decision victory ksi so just a

505
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,860
hella hella emotional celebration he

506
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:48,330
falls to the floor and and you know

507
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,340
that's super cool to see like this man

508
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,190
this might work just as hard as I did to

509
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,230
get this victory and I I'm incredibly

510
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,519
happy for him and I I'm like I said I'm

511
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,990
excited to see what he does next and

512
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:02,669
it's weird like you can see me like

513
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:04,230
register the loss and I think at one

514
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:06,389
point I like grabbed my chest and I'm

515
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,419
like how how cuz I literally just like

516
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:11,070
if it's stung especially cuz I I was

517
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,960
doing the calculation in my head if I if

518
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,460
I did not get the two points taken away

519
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,990
from me I would have won the fight but

520
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,639
again what a shoulda coulda next time

521
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,610
I'm not gonna be an idiot and then you

522
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:22,769
know everyone saw ksi and I we'd apt up

523
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,330
at the end we settled the beef although

524
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,340
it still might be half I don't I don't

525
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,570
know dude I'm on the ready to move on to

526
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,129
the next portion of my life which will

527
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,480
most definitely include fighting because

528
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:32,480
it's super exciting and I think you guys

529
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:40,350
like it but I'm being honest with you
