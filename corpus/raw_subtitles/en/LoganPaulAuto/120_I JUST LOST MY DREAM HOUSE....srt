can you tripod the camera okay I bought

168
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,190
a house as you guys know but the way it

169
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,390
works is they put the money and it's

170
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,220
because it's like a lot of money in this

171
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,350
thing called escrow basically gives the

172
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,000
buyers me a chance to decide if they

173
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,440
want to buy the house I mentioned this

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,700
to you guys there was a lot of things

175
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,650
wrong with the house like brand-new

176
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,330
house it was awesome just the Builder

177
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,610
did not come through and like literally

178
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,990
the house like could have fallen fall we

179
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,240
could essentially be like standing in

180
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,920
the garage and like it just collapses

181
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,930
from under us or swimming in the pool

182
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,060
and the pool just like destroys itself

183
