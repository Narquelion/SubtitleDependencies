here was a team maverick being complete

26
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:27,549
degenerate in nature and now they seem

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:34,920
to be attempting to host something to

28
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:34,920
social media it's a horse with a man

29
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:43,090
look at this thing this is the kind of

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:44,500
thing you don't help paper directions

31
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,100
can you make that noise again

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:52,599
okay now never make henna go there are

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:58,720
so many words can you stop making noise

34
00:01:52,599 --> 00:02:01,479
you sound like a turtle having sex where

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,459
is Spencer all I see is urine he said

36
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,470
we're crossing three rivers good thing I

37
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:07,810
wore these white pants those white shoes

38
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,099
ain't in that white hoodie cause last

39
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,690

40
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:12,160
words in the game uh-huh yeah I signed

41
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,690
my waiver terrifying cuz you know you

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,190
don't read them you have to resist that

43
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:20,440
amazing I don't need this I don't need

44
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:21,880
that zipper just missing him by the way

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,680
this was his idea to go bungee jumping

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,600
our instructor is behind this you're

47
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,519
telling me just to do who drives a

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:41,970
Corvette where's my life that seems a

49
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:48,340
bit weird but okay I'm in too deep dude

50
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:49,959
crossing once again after five miles of

51
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,359
hiking two and a half hours we finally

52
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:57,000
reached the bridge to nowhere literally

53
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:57,000
that's what it's called probably nowhere

54
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:09,690
oh my god in my mind it's a great idea

55
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:12,090
chances of the cord like snapping and

56
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,860
falling on a rock pretty good okay

57
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,240
what's the purpose of this bridge I

58
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,780
noticed it runs into the side of a

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,250
mountain

60
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,990
why else would have made this bridge I

61
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,640
feel more comfortable jumping out of a

62
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,840
plane to be on something about jumping

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:32,700
out of a plane is lightly more

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:35,340
comfortable these are brand new thanks
