60
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,500
deep hole deep puddles only this is good

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,090
too while you're reading the warnings

62
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,530
I'm actually gonna have you sign the

63
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,450
waiver that we have printed up it's just

64
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,890
reliability purposes is waiver just one

65
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,240

66
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:36,320

67
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,320
signing my life away

68
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,550
you got this keep on going so look I'm

69
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,630
not a tubing expert I don't know if this

70
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,980
thing's gonna be able to handle it on

71
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,510
the road so I figured I'd give it a

72
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,510
quick test drive you guys saw yesterday

73
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,310
still gonna send it with the tube this

74
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,310
time

75
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,519
it looks like she honks yeah bro this

76
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:28,080
thing's good definitely hungry I think

77
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:35,820
we take her to the road well that's

78
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:41,340
because you brought camels Andi that

79
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:42,870
seems good that one line 47% chance of

80
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,750
working honestly I'll take those odds

81
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,820
let's hit the road jack how long before

82
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,430
you think saying Huck it is just really

83
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,720
annoying it's been a pretty good two or

84
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,520
three days that we've been saying it

85
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,260
right and I'm already really annoyed of

86
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,590
it but until today is over I'm still

87
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,120
gonna hack it

88
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,530
listen you signed the waiver so this is

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,759
kind of unnecessary conversation but

90
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,680
what are you driving don't slam on your

91
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,060
