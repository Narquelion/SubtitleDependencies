73
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,940

like I don't have a vlog can we do

82
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,370
something and we came up with an idea do

83
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:06,489
a show called date Logan called

84
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:07,900
Logan oh no like I see in the comments

85
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,890
Chloe reads the comments that like hash

86
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,299
tag closes like it's sort of a thing

87
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,120
anyway like I can't just walk and be

88
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:18,549
like not ready you'll wake me again let

89
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,889
me just reiterate needs the stop so

90
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:23,110
we're gonna experiment and see if Chloe

91
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:24,580
and I actually went on a date like what

92
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,110
that would be like like personally

93
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,729
obviously you guys know it'd be fire and

94
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,350
obviously and in this match I'm just

95
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,770
kidding Chloe confident like she's like

96
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,400

102
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,780

restaurant which one is called 300 what

121
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,220

129
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,569

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,440
I respect it

131
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:33,449
next question

132
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,430
get your very first date with Chloe how

133
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,849
soon is the date you wait until you ask

134
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,949
her she'll smash oh here's the thing I

135
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:43,169
think Khloe would ask me about five

136
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,090
minutes in not this she sees what I

137
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:48,270
wanted nice young gentleman I am she

138
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,430
like straight up last night okay Chloe

139
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,639
the waiter comes to the table with your

140
00:06:50,430 --> 00:07:03,630
order but it's the wrong thing what do

141
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:07,770
you do she talks as a waiter

142
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:09,389
I'm just mean to you what's your deal

143
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,279
cuz you need to be given a hard time

144
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:15,360
because you're looking ridiculous he's

145
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,039
ridiculous you guys next portion of the

146
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:23,270
interview we're gonna do who knows who

147
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:27,870
back what is Chloe's favorite watermelon

148
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:33,590
what is Logan's favorite saying yeah eat

149
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:33,590
a lot any Santa Angela and he says

150
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,729
that's my boy I just said like the five

151
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:43,669
things that you say all what did you say

152
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:47,589
is Khloe's least favorite trait in a

153
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:52,610
cast member me that's correct

154
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:55,159
Mogens favorite smell correct

155
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,539
on a scale of one to ten Logan how much

156
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,360
chemistry would you say you and Chloe

157
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:00,620
have we're looking 80 she stopped being

158
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,809
such a grandma and stop trying to

159
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,479
control me I think we'd be top-notch I

160
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:08,180
think we're at like 83 purrs like the

161
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,129
same amount of balls okay it's just in

162
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,629
my right testicle I only have 85% of all

163
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:19,639
if you didn't see a vlog it's really out

164
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:23,599
of context fighting me Chloe

165
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,899
YouTube cop I'm just Chloe and then

166
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,899
killer

167
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:35,500
Chloe marry kill Logan Logan Logan I

168
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:35,500
kill Logan

169
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:44,389
like I kill Logan and then I think I'd

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,749
kill Logan they used to pick up where

171
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:49,420

the light at the end of the tunnel I

176
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:02,600
don't think Khloe has given me a chance

177
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,550
to prove my work you know she just

178
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,939
assumes that I'm just an Internet star

179
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,670
who makes blogs every day and can't

180
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:11,690
handle a full-on relationship

181
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,819
