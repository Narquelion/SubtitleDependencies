what I was saying earlier as you guys

260
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,920
know this is a very expensive music

261
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,180
video and I'm paying for all of it I

262
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,770
felt like I needed to I wanted to do

263
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,270
something like really like artsy and

264
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,220
cinematic so that's what this is but

265
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,750
this particular scene I forgot to get

266
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,980
reaction shots the other night and I

267
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,140
know we're gonna need them when we go to

268
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,450
edit the video so I made the whole crew

269
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,000
come back to this location just to get

270
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,440
literally like 5 reaction shots and it

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,280
probably cost me like this scene alone

272
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,750
probably another like 20k really use

273
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,750
your brain when you're shooting because

274
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:30,750
