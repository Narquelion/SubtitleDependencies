196
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,330
Denver you're talking about what happens

197
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:50,950
if someone builds a building like we had

198
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,390
this conversation yeah like you can't

199
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,010
mess up when you're building a big build

200
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,900
that building straight ahead it's pretty

201
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,540
