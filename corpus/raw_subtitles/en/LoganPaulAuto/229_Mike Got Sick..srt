about it's not like there's a global

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,040
virus going around and those are the two

53
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,480
core symptoms so this morning I tried to

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,650
prank Mike with plastic wrap when he

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,610
walked outside of his room but

56
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:56,240
unfortunately it did not work given the

57
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,590
fact that he's also sick I thought it

58
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,960
would be a good idea to place him in

59
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,210
quarantine and redeem I should pray so

60
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,750
we picked up some wood hammer nails and

61
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,750
went to work
