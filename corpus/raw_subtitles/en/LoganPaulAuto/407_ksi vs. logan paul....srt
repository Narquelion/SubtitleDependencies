1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,890
wow what a fight man what a fight what a

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,840
night I still have a black eye from the

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,639
fight I don't even know where to start

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,860
this video I guess I'll start with this

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,840
after my first ever amateur boxing match

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:22,590
your boy is undefeated I also have zero

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,670
wins that's right oh oh and one oh and

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:30,990
water what is that a draw was a draw oh

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,570
my gosh ah I hate that so much I hate it

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,180
so much when they raised our hands you

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,210
can see by my face my mouth dropped I'm

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,890
I was absolutely stunned ksi has the

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,090
exact same reaction on the other side

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,940
it's weird because you don't know

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,399
whether to celebrate or be disappointed

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,170
like you didn't win but you didn't lose

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,300
and after talking to you guys in public

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,910
at the airport's the general consensus

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,010
seems to be if you wanted ksi to win you

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,140
think he won and if you wanted me to win

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,180
you think I want it's it's split I

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,670

88
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,030

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,490
like to skiing address some people are

90
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,520
saying the fight was raped or that it

91
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:29,940
was staged or that it was faked from the

92
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:33,110
bottom of my heart literally suck my ass

93
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,910
JJ and I put our hearts on the line

94
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:39,900
everything we had we were warriors out

95
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:45,120
there beating the [ __ ] out of each other

96
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:52,650
we all worked so hard so and for anyone

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:55,950
to say that was fake also another thing

98
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,560
in addition to that last one Oh God made

99
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,620
new you the doll about the fight so Rick

100
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,290
I've read articles that have said ksi

101
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,370
and I have walked away with 30 to 40

102
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:11,040
million dollars each I cannot stress how

103
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:14,190
false that is and how each one of the

104
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,510
fighters involved was absolutely not

105
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,459
doing it for the money

106
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,890
let me explain I might make an entire

107
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,770
video on this if my team lets me but

108
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,180
between all the expenses on god I am NOT

109
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,610
just saying this for the internet I am

110
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,210
not a hundred percent sure I came out

111
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,610
positive

112
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,460
on this event that means I'm not sure if

113
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,780
I made money on the event think about it

114
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,819
there is no this isn't like an official

115
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,580
boxing league the pay-per-view unlike

116
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,220
boxing pay-per-view events and UFC

117
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,770
pay-per-view events was not $100 right

118
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,990
it was $10 there was no official major

119
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,000
big sponsor there's no Al Heyman checks

120
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,220
coming in this is a couple youtubers

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,039
doing this four year entertainment who

122
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,130
are yes trying to make money I think we

123
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,590
severely miscalculated the expenses

124
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,470
examples including 30% of the revenue

125
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,750
goes to YouTube right away then I split

126
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,820
the remainder with team ksi then I split

127
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,250
that with Jake accordingly then out of

128
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,289
that another 30% goes to my managers

129
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,419
lawyers agents everyone involved from my

130
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,699
team we paid for venues our full-time

131
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,650
boxing coach we flew like 30 to 40

132
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,449
people out to Manchester and provided

133
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,009
them with lodging for like two weeks I

134
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:21,990
could go on and on and on and like I

135
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,159
said I might make a full entire video

136
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,900
about this in the future if you guys

137
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:26,370
want to see it so yeah again subscribe

138
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,380
and let me know in the comments below

139
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,159
but okay as far as the fight goes let's

140
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,710
talk about the fight oh oh man my first

141
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:36,900
ever amateur boxing fight with really

142
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:42,840
only four months of training under my

143
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:45,120
belt good I want to say I was pretending

144
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,070
to be a boxer cause like I had the

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,780
fundamentals down but people you know

146
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,070
they worked their whole lives to be good

147
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,330
at this one thing good to be good at

148
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,729
this sport and I was going in there

149
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,060
right as a youtuber first not a fighter

150
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:59,849
or not a boxer and no one told me how

151
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,750
different it is from sparring in a gym

152
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:06,060
to competing inside a ring in an actual

153
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,729
fight with 20,000 people watching and

154
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,979
millions on the internet night and ski

155
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:13,380
day and I am pretty sure that's why I

156
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,330
gassed out in the later round but I will

157
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,820
say after leaving the ring that night I

158
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,889
finally now feel like a fighter I

159
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,560
finally feel comfortable saying I am a

160
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:25,229
boxer and the sport is so fun dude like

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,909
just two dudes seeing the shot of each

162
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,419
other it's a beautiful thing that

163
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:32,099
experience is valuable but I did walk

164
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,500
out of the ring that night finally

165
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,389
feeling like a boxer and if if I got

166
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,789
that good after only four months of

167
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:41,130
training I cannot imagine how good I'm

168
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,080
gonna be by the time I fight ksi

169
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,120
or whoever I fight next now with that

170
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,600
said I thought I won the fight I thought

171
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,970
I won 4-2 I thought I won rounds 1 2 3 &

172
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,910
5 ksi hands down took the fourth round

173
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:56,730
and obviously the 6th round where he'd

174
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:59,610
just he [ __ ] me up back in a line that

175
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,560
was me just trying to stay alive I was

176
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,530
completely out of gas and I was a little

177
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,270
disappointed that his cheap shots his

178
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,440
throwdowns his fouls like you guys

179
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,440
remember when he hit me after the bell

180
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,830
dog thing to do man like that was just

181
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:24,090
shady fighting ksi is like fighting a

182
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,860
dog dude became animalistic not a boxer

183
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,510
after the first two rounds something his

184
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,520
coach must have said stuck in his mind

185
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,380
because he turned it on but he was just

186
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,270
throwing haymakers from down here none

187
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,220
of them were like legit boxing punches

188
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,350
and you guys can imagine when I spar I'm

189
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,200
sparring professionals not dudes who are

190
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,120
head down just swinging for the fences

191
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,650
so again first boxing match on my part

192
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,350
great you can get away with the sloppy

193
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,120
bulls but for the second match I promise

194
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,710
not a single one of those is going to

195
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,030
land so yeah I think he was able to get

196
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,860
away with the cheap shots because we

197
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,910
were in his country his hometown not

198
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,830
gonna be the same when he comes to

199
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,450
United States in fact I'm not going to

200
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,770
leave it to the judges I just simply

201
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,130
won't and now that I know what I'm

202
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,380
missing

203
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,000
and I know what I'm good at the

204
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,610
improvement is only gonna be there I

205
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,380
think you can sort of see can't sighs

206
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,600
demeanor after the fight and during the

207
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,780
fight there's like a underlayer of

208
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,450
disappointment I think it's because he

209
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,460
knows he missed his chance like that was

210
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,800
it you had a chance to beat me and you

211
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,750
almost did if there were more rounds you

212
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,130
might have beaten me I'm not sure you

213
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,960
might have beaten me cuz I was

214
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,560
completely out of gas but there wasn't

215
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,380
and it's over now like I'm only gonna

216
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,460
get exponentially better but regardless

217
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:38,250
again it was a phenomenal fight ksi mega

218
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,950
kudos to you dude you have the heart of

219
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,050
a skiing warrior and I told you that

220
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,770
after the fight both you and I know that

221
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:48,300
six round a bro you took me for a ride

222
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,370
that round my goal was to just stay

223
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,070
alive which I did my issue at not issue

224
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,290
but when I get hit and case I was

225
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,630
hitting me a lot that round with

226
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,279
lot of big strong fast powerful punches

227
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,709
this happens in sparring - I don't

228
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,480
register it I don't mind getting hit in

229
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:03,920
fact I like it unless you knock me out

230
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,899
like I am NOT falling to the ground

231
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,730
which is good but at the same time

232
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,410
there'd be times in sparring where my

233
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,970
coach is like yo what the [ __ ] you doing

234
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,190
like we we have to stop because I'll be

235
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,100
so tired my hands will be down and I'm

236
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,329
only using my face as as a weapon and

237
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,740
it's not a weapon literally I'm just

238
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:20,810
getting hit in the face repeatedly I'm

239
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,550
sure I'll suffer brain damage later in

240
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,800
my life for for doing these things

241
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,709
that's part of it I guess but I gotta

242
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,160
say I think the warrior blood runs in

243
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:33,769
chaos eyes family cuz Deji tangi you

244
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,750
impressed me bro you impressed everyone

245
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:38,209
I don't think a single person thought

246
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,870
you were gonna last five rounds bro good

247
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:41,240
job to you

248
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,490
hats off I think you proved a lot of

249
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,079
people wrong that night including myself

250
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,230
but of course brother Jake came out with

251
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:50,720
the victory I love Jake it was so nice

252
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,819
to see all of his hard work these past

253
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,540
couple months pay off and Jake man it

254
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:59,510
must be nice having a belt like that and

255
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,370
having an official win you [ __ ]

256
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,399
I'm just kidding kinda anyway the best

257
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,639
part about this event hands down was

258
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,130
afterwards the sportsmanship the fact

259
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,040
that we four dudes are able to get in

260
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:15,290
this little square and beat this of each

261
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,029
other and then shake hands and look each

262
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,720
other in the eye afterwards that was

263
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:20,630
invaluable

264
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,130
those were the special moments those are

265
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,860
the moments that I'll never forget

266
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:27,319
cuz as much as I like fighting it's the

267
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,940
last resort always why would I ever want

268
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:30,680
to do that I'm all about spreading love

269
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,449
and positivity and happiness and the

270
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,579
fact that we were all able to squash the

271
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:36,829
beef one night right them right there

272
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:40,399
was incredible and then for me obviously

273
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:42,260
this year has been obviously you guys

274
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
know like what it's been after the fight

275
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,569
Jordy asked me a question and I was able

276
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,240
to answer it in a way that I felt

277
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:53,319
encompassed and represented what this

278
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,319
fight was about for me

279
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,980

[Music]

281
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,620
that was definitely the most important

282
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:29,110
part of the fight for me just just so

283
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:31,540
many emotions and yeah crazy crap I

284
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:36,370
don't even know this is it's a crazy

285
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:41,160
life man 23 years old youtubing acting

vlogger chat boy who knows what the list

288
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,380
will go on to say but overall um I don't

289
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,280
want to say I feel cheated or

290
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,010
disappointed I think the word is

291
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,870
slighted I feel slighted but that tells

292
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,930
me that I have to work that much harder

293
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:02,320
the taste of not winning is absolutely

294
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,420
disgusting I promise the next time I set

295
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,720
foot in that ring I will be so scary

296
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,400
good I will be an actual boxer and I'm

297
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,640
