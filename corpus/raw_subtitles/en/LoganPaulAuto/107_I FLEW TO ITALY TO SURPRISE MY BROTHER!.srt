out and buy a Lamborghini well we went

172
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,010

00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,890
some Lambo and then it hit me after I

183
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,660
had time to like think about it cuz yo

184
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,000
you guys know this I'm a maverick once I

185
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,130
have time so like actually used my brain

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,990
that's that's that's where things go

187
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,690
south for me yeah so I was like you know

188
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,520
like Jake loves cars he loves spending

189
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,110
his money on cars on vehicle we were

190
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,640
even texting once about like how happy

191
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,230
we are for each other and how this life

192
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,670
were living is absolutely insane and

193
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,790
he's like bro I just want to drive fast

194
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,830

197
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,750
lot of money like that's no joke and I'm

spending that much money on something I

199
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,730
should I should freaking love so then I

200
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,280
made the decision to not get a Lambo

201
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,230
like for me I was getting a Lambo just

202
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,910
to get a Lambo not to like actually like

203
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,470
drive it and enjoy which is not a good

204
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,420
