98
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:05,549
alright I'm already tearing up I had

99
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:08,610
these one time they were the worst out

100
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:10,229
of the ante up swing leave will mess up

101
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,329
your whole life I'd say we do three

102
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:41,459
because I don't want to die are you

103
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:42,659
shocked 3 what helped me to 1 these are

104
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:43,919
the worst so we're gonna pop these on

105
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,229
right now I thought they were getting

106
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,809
regular gum but they are terrible no

107
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:50,849
these are so these are the worst because

108
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,709
the sour coating on the outside is like

109
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:57,449
the first thing oh and then you get to

110
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:58,919

111
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,539

this before it's a sour spray rain I'm

115
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,769
gonna do it by second and I think you

116
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,149
should do as many as you can in five

117
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:17,569

118
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:17,569
okay five four three two one done okay

119
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:27,059
that was horrible

120
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:30,329
alright so I think we're gonna do one

121
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:32,069
other one with one final coating I gotta

122
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:34,399
