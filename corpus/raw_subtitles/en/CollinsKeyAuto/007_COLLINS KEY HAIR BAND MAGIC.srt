just I don't even have like a bill or

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,309
something it's like a one dollar bill

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,849
[Music]

8
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:16,289
cool okay

9
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,869
get to check out so we got a bill and

10
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,699
here we go I got the paper clip of doom

11
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,109
so here this I hold on to these two for

12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,180
me and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

13
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,130
use these two hair bands and you guys

14
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,260
see what's called like the linking metal

15
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,789
rings right yeah yeah we take a teeny

16
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,260
like linked together this is kind like

17
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,360
the budget version of that but the goal

18
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,770
is still the same right it's still

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,540
trying to get the two bands to link

20
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,489
together and so basically how this works

21
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,460
here we go let's can take it right down

22
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:45,329
the middle watch we go one we go to

23
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,399
right there three the two bands that you

24
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,789
link together I'll say they're really

25
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,809
linked here oh yeah yeah

26
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,219
all right here going to check us out

27
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,719
here what I want you to do is just go

28
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,039
forward pinch on the hair bands and then

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,930
kind of rub back and forth yeah it's

30
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,649
like that yeah don't let go right there

31
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,940
I hear would you try something else

32
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,220
we'll use the bill this time so what I

33
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,479
want you to do is um you got two right

34
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,770
there perfect we're gonna use these two

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,450
hair bands to create basically like a

36
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,130
metaphorical ladder almost you have the

37
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,869
top the ladder second step third step

38
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,400
then you got the bottom the ladder so

39
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,320
take the bill unfold it once for us yeah

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,259
just like that take it right here and

41
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:25,020
then paper clip the ends together where

42
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:27,270
there's no way to get to build off it

43
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,799
doesn't like me okay awesome it's like

44
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,630
that perfect so the bill is clearly

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,890
there on the top now the goal is to

46
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,560
actually get the bill to melt down to

47
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:41,159
the second step so check this out to go

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:46,100
