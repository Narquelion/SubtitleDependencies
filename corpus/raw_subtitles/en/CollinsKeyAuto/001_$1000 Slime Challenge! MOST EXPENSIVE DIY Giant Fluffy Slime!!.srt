15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,190

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,840
video was done with Karina because this

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,909
video is actually inspired by that video

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,500
I had to learn slime from the queen of

23
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,689
slime herself Karina Garcia and she

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,009
taught Manon a fluffy slime we made $500

25
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,320
worth so basically I doubled the recipe

26
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,580

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,930
learned a tip from the master you only

183
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,940
add a little bit of stop flow at a time

184
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,770
and then really mix it together okay you

185
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,550
haven't even Rita appreciate your help

186
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,380
here we go

187
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,900
you can add a little bit that's a little

188
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,720
bit it's probably a lot Wow that's

189
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,680
insane it's truck wait wait hold on look

190
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,140
at this but why I just want to leave it

191
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,180
as that fluffy cloud no bro yeah we

192
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,260
really just got to work it all in

193
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,140
because you don't want a gloopy at all

194
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:30,220
right that's not slime I learned this

195
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:32,800
from the master it's like a drum bro

196
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:41,440
dude it sounds so back off back off for

197
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:43,330
one second this is so legit before

198
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,130
feeling through felt like a cloud but

199
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,350
now you just feel these little spider

200
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,880
webs almost okay so we gotta make sure

201
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,770
we mix it up immediately so kind of like

202
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,750
really get in there oh my gosh there's

203
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,640
we've lost so much of this stuff in the

204
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,650
process of the everything it's all on my

205
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,120
feet this feels like an alien substance

206
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:03,940
