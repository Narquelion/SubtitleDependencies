tug of war battle but as you can tell

132
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,139
instead of pulling on the rope

133
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,879
we don't wanna destroy our hands with

134
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,379
rope burn we've tied it to ourselves and

135
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,849
ended up looking like really connected

136
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,069
by an umbilical cord all right here we

137
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:51,009

a really good tug of war battle at all I

143
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,349
feel like everything we do turns into a

144
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,190
sumo battle I wonder why I guess we call

145
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:17,199
it a draw

146
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:19,479
