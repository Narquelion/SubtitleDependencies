long this like a foot how do you even

47
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,780
judge nine yards like my front yard is

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,790
more than 15 feet to 9 times 15 I gotta

49
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,409

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,689
next calculator to let's see my front

52
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:53,640
yard is like 15 feet and it's 9 yards to

53
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,820
9 of my yards times 9 equals it went

54
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,310
away

55
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:02,579
15 times 9 equals 130 yards no you 130

56
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,720
feet yeah the whole 130 feet was a 30 or

57
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:09,090
35 it's 35 the whole 935 930

58
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,860
five Dyson moving on I am SuperDuper

59
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,990
excited to be on America's Got Talent

60
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,550
or as we like to say in the business egt

61
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,410
know if you saw me on the show hit the

62
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,060
thumbs-up button show me some love I've

63
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,250
always watched American talent but never

64
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,170
in a million years did I ever think that

65
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,970
I would actually be on the show so to

66
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,290
actually be on the show this season is

67
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,430
it's really a dream come true

68
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,470
because I something I've always kind of

69
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,270
wanted to do but the magic that I

70
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,800
perform is not really meant for

71
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,580
America's Got Talent because more

72
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,410
close-up magic

73
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,030
whereas America's Got Talent usually all

74
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,290
the big stage illusion so I thought I

75
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,520
was going to boot off the stage because

76
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,780
the audience would be able to see the

77
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,370
close-up magic now I'm going to get a

78
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,630
couple axes and they get torn apart by

79
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,730
the judges so that's why it was such a

80
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,959
shock when I got a scathing ovation and

81
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,690
the judges had nothing but great things

82
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,370
to say that is a love thing over there

83
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,200
whatever that is now we got some like

84
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,940
air conditioning finger just went off

85
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,860
yeah I got a guy I got shut that off

86
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,600
it's messing with my video flow of

87
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,730
homies let's shuffle this summer is

88
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,870
