one of my favorite clips Elon Musk I

121
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,339
don't know why that's how this came to

122
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,439
be I guess cuz they're both rich and

123
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,930
they're both philanthropists I think

124
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:57,480
entrepreneurs at the very least this is

125
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:01,199
Jack Ma he's the richest person in China

126
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,420
he owns the website Alibaba which sells

127
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:06,180
it's like Amazon but for Chinese

128
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,189
products basically and he is the most

129
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,879
annoying person I have ever had to

130
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:15,180
listen to and eelain has the this is why

131
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:20,129
I called artificial intelligence I call

132
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,480
it Alibaba intelligence yeah yeah you

133
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:22,370
know as a joke is funny if you that's

134
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,809
your reaction

135
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,199
Alibaba yes it's your company we get it

136
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:28,889
might end up being true you never know

137
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:33,240
information now it's basically with

138
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:35,189
speech yeah I'm always amazed by what

139
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,330
your vision about the technology I'm not

140
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:39,530
a tech guy

141
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:42,720
I think I'm all about life I think AI

142
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:45,480
opened a new chapter of the society of

143
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,420
the world that people try to understand

144
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,840
ourselves better rather than the outside

145
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:56,300
world it's so difficult to predict the

146
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,740
future this is great 99.99% of the

147
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:08,640
predictions the human being had in

148
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:10,980
history about the future all wrong zero

149
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,590
point like Noah's laughing of the

150
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,900
prediction right there right because by

151
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:26,670
accident yeah but it's also true that

152
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:28,380
80% of statistics are false so good it's

153
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,800
also true that 80% of predictions are

154
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,650
wrong

155
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,310
yeah this contradicts everything you

156
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:37,170
just said all the dumb [ __ ] you said 99%

157
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:44,370
of all predictions are wrong including

158
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:46,200
that one yeah people worry a lot about

159
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:52,140
this today are those people

160
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:55,560

great fun and we want to change our self

164
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,050
to embrace it I don't know man that's

165
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,620
like famous last words

166
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:10,410

167
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,180
McConaughey because he'd recent got an

168
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,920

170
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,730
people that you're not very smart but

171
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,980

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:24,840
least interesting and you just say a

173
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,190

00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:05,440
it's the same character as Jacquemont

186
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:08,650
just change a biology to get there good

187
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,290
yeah well let's talk about something fun

188
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,850
night what do you think about that I

189
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:16,540
actually I'm not interested in a Mars I

190
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:18,880
just came back from there so hahahaha oh

191
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:22,210
my god he did the same on the earth the

192
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,320
things happening here so what why yes I

193
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,910
think this is a reason why I'm someone

194
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,800
no Vijay Kumar because it's such a

195
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:31,930
boring ass statement to say oh why are

196
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,990
we looking outside in space with like

197
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,640
earth it's more important we have issues

198
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,460
now with the environment that is really

199
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,800
pressing like yes there are issues on

200
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,290
this planet there's always been that

201
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,630
doesn't mean we can't look beyond and do

202
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:50,020
other solve other problems as well we

203
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:52,170
are literally overdue meteor hitting our

204
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:57,160
planet with like 40,000 years

205
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:58,330
statistically so I would say to not look

206
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,880
at other planet is extremely

207
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,800
irresponsible and to have someone a

208
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,660
private company a private person being

209
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,760
the forefront of that it's like it's

210
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,680
commendable I don't want to hear it from

211
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,620
this guy Singh I'm not interested in

212
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,540
Mars I care more about here I get it

213
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,520
okay I really get it but at the same

214
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,520
time you can care about both it is

215
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,930
possible just a one step you go to Mars

216
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,930
but you would never be able to come back

217
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,130
I hate to go to the Himalayas - I mean

218
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,540
when you climb on the I think someday I

219
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:38,170
would go there when the elevator is

220
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,339
ready I would go to have a look that

221
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,380
seems like words from someone that

222
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:44,320
worked hard to get what they they burn

223
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,300
rank maybe if there's elevator I will go

224
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,950
I wish I was the kind of person like

225
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,150
Elin that can hold it together but this

226
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,890
stuff it did piss me out

227
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,110
alright this became a whole tangent

228
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,550
