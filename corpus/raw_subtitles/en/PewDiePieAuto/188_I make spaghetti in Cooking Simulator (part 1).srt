1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,980
let's make some goddamn spaghetti that's

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,410
right my name is PewDiePie and I'm on a

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,389
mission to make spaghetti in a cooking

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,280
simulator I have not played this game

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,370
before so I don't even know if it's

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,730
possible that's how committed I am to

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,920
this spaghetti making spaghetti is one

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,390
of those few things that I actually know

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,740
how to cook how does it work

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,109
oh it's a blender okay all right

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,119
spaghetti is one of those few things

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,969
that I actually know how to cook the lie

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,950
detector determined that was a lot now

14
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,040
the first thing you need to do for a

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:43,410
successful spaghetti is chop the onion

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:46,860
so let's grab them okay let's see how

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,390
you do this okay chop

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,190
I like onion I don't like the

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:56,629
consistencies I always chop them very

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:59,550
finely which is what we're gonna do here

21
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,440
okay well that's good enough hey maybe I

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,489
can use the blender you think I wanted

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:14,369
that work move vertically okay okay okay

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:15,900
drop what's happening do that yeah all

25
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,430
right that doesn't work all right so we

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,460
have our onion that one is breaking it

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,729
down for some reason oh we can put it in

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:30,979
the food processor put it in gently

29
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:30,979
gently put it in gently thank you

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,350
now now they will be chopped

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,550

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,630

33
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:52,690
alright let's just chop it right here

34
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:54,790
I'm sick of this I just realize now I

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,350
have to pick them all up individually

36
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,970
I'm a goddamn idiot

37
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,130

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,640
board for cutting onion guess that it

44
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,450
might be a might be it sucks it up okay

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,330
and you don't want onion sucked up in
