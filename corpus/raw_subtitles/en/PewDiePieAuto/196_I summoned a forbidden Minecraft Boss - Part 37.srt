in a second I just want to show it broke

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,790

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,549
you can get a lot of XP by melting them

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,170
as you can see just look how much I

26
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,450
experienced up there absolutely

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,180
incredible but yeah our new house looks

28
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:37,049

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,530
keep going chickens

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,530
um

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:01,950
yeah am I the only one I hear that like

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,420
go crazy got a stroke finally oh my god

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,050
I just got an even better idea

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,409
okay so think this is how you make there

37
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,679
we go

38
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:14,819
okay so this will shoot eggs right at

39
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:18,209
English stupid face stupid face don't

40
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,560
ever touch my child but what I realize

41
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:25,040
this we can have it the eggs actually

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:28,380
dispatch in here and make a forever

43
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,330
forever Ingmar shooting in face this I

44
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:40,290
get all the best ideas in this game if

45
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:44,130
someone told me hey look at me

46
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,600
that's right that's what I thought if

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,650
someone told me I was gonna build the

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,830
first egg face shooting infinite chicken

49
00:02:49,650 --> 00:03:04,680
mechanism I would say you're a madman

50
00:02:52,830 --> 00:03:06,660
but now look at me yes yes you will pay

51
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,459
for your war crimes angry got that

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,500
that's a lot of chickens I'm gonna go

53
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,269
and you think what about you daughter

54
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,850
don't worry about that Sven I was just

55
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:20,180
talking to Ingvar and it seems it's cool

56
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,180
now what's that well I heard him

57
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,650
what's that's been yeah

58
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,890
what's that but so and look in here

59
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:34,680
spend please look at me what it's when

60
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:37,980
it's for him what oh god he knows I

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,739
think he alright so a big focus that I

62
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,500
want to do today is actually getting

63
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,120
some proper redstone in this house I had

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,739
this underground lair which is really

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,920
cool here you can't see anything right

66
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:54,720
look watch this and it's late pretty

67
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,180
cool right I wanted to make like a

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,650
secret door for it the problem is a nice

69
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,050
vent nice the problem is I don't

70
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,850
remember

71
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,620
I don't remember how you make a secret

72
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,390
door I'm gonna try and do with honey

73
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,820
block I know they're illegal but it but

74
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,840
it's okay I imported it from

75
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,530
Czechoslovakia because I think that way

76
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:16,160
I can actually make a quite big piston

77
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:18,470
door hidden nests of epic without making

78
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,160
it complicated is usually when you go

79
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:26,030
bigger it's complicated in Minecraft so

80
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,640
it's gonna go here bing bang yeah I

81
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,350
think 5x5 is the biggest five by two I

82
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:35,240
mean yeah I think it could be really

83
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:37,550
cool the idea have this just one piston

84
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,910
right and then one piston pull it back

85
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,700
as such the problem is really just the

86
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,830
timing because it can obviously can't

87
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,800
activate now it's not gonna do anything

88
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,270
you know I'm I'm uh I know I know a

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,830
thing or two more than I used to know

90
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,170
god these things used to be so painful

91
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,420
isn't that right ahead so the signal

92
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,100
will probably come from here okay so now

93
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,800
we have a signal coming from the top

94
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,300
down here and another signal is going to

95
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,970
go in there however we need to cut off

96
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:09,860
the stream it sounds so stupid and then

97
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:12,620
put it in as such okay so that's our

98
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,300
floor right we need this floor not just

99
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,670
to go down but we also needed to go to

100
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,180
the side so we can go in so let's say we

101
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:23,750
activate it it goes down and then point

102
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,260
is this gets activated as well and then

103
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,820
pulls it back that works right however

104
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,370
the problem is if these get deactivated

105
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,000
at the same time so then I'm explaining

106
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,480
to you saying

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,670
it just doesn't work it doesn't pull it

108
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,220
back because it pulls itself back before

109
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,260
so this signal needs to hold itself and

110
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,650
then pull back instead of pulling back

111
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,120
immediately a way to solve this is to

112
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,540
put a comparator if you put them like

113
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,550
this it can hold the signal so when do

114
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,480
the singer remove it hold set and then

115
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:59,870
pulls it back try that again

116
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:04,400
remove holds it holds back it works

117
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,820
big brain so now if we give it a test we

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,820
have a four

119
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,700
we have an opening and what screamed or

120
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:17,520
by using slime is that we can use 12

121
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:20,950
pieces so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

122
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:29,800
without any extra wiring so let's try it

123
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:32,250
all right cool and what's even better

124
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,050
with my legal imported from

125
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,820
