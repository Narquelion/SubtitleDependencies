1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
good morning gamers what up Steuben

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:11,250
who's a good boy today we are building

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,429
something special for my minecraft dog I

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,719
don't know exactly what we're gonna pill

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:18,570
but that's the fun of Minecraft

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,150
isn't that right Sven that's right I've

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,189
been messing around a lot with you with

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,970
redstone I have a lot of fun doing it

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,980
and I finally learned how to build

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,260
robots and stuff like that so I want to

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,620
build a giant robot for my for my dog I

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,510
don't know if this will work but that's

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,300
the fun of it that's the part of it what

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,820
I do know is how to build a leg

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:45,950
mechanism in Minecraft

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:49,079
with redstone okay gamers and it's

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,329
actually really cool and really easy so

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,120
we're just gonna do that bling blang

19
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,460
blang you do a bling blang blang see if

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,940
I remember and you do a bling blang

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,410
blang and then bling this will all make

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,850
sense you have to do the sound effects

23
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,580
otherwise it doesn't work this needs to

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,909
go here and then this needs to go here

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,950
and it's goes here and there you go

26
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,159
there we have a leg doesn't look like

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,600
much of a leg does its fame cool the

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,900
basic gist of it is you'll have a piston

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,640
pushing here and voila this goes up

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,970
which activates this piston which pushed

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,990
it pushes it forward which gives us like

32
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:32,490
robot like leg movement very cool which

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,880
means of course we can build you

34
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:39,420
something very adorable sent about we do

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,640
this orange like the honey block and

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,470
we'll build you a little kitty cat how

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,659
about that Sven you like kid the cat's

38
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:51,030
well hope will build Sven and giant

39
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:53,549
elaborate that look house man he's so

40
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,899
impressed he can't wait I mean other

41
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,600
than that it's pretty simple you just

42
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:02,430
need said no stop you need something to

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,140
just push this basically 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

44
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,450
9 10 11

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,930
can we put a boat here and put spend in

46
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:15,379
the boat yes oh I'm getting the boat

47
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,640
get in the boat son I ask a question all

48
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,980
right fine you can get in the boat I'll

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,530
make sure it's safe then we just need to

50
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:25,459
add a motor to it I'll use that we'll

51
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,659
hit the ones I use it works okay they'll

52
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,569
make fun of me all right

53
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:32,870

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:51,879
I forgot the redstone and go

59
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,760

63
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,530
it

64
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,530
[Music]

65
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,470
yeah

66
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:25,800
[Music]

67
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:27,330
yeah onwards spend

68
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,230
you're looking in the wrong direction

69
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,030
but this is so cool

70
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:37,989
[Music]

71
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:42,670
okay time to stop time to stop yay I'm

72
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:44,739
so glad you made it safe what does that

73
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,530
look like I'm trying to figure out like

74
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:50,769
what animal I should bill for him maybe

75
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:54,329
I'll ask him Twitter a lot of people are

76
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:59,799
saying tanks a lot of people are saying

77
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:02,310
the moving doghouse that's so buddy so

78
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,439
this is cool and all it's very basic

79
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,689
it's when lumps in the problem I have it

80
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,639
with it is that it's walking like this I

81
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:14,950
don't like that I want one leg one leg

82
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:16,979
one leg you understand me and to do that

83
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:26,020
we need a different type of motor

84
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:28,150
spending is on top of this literally the

85
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,870
Redstone community on YouTube is so cool

86
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,490
everyone is building such amazing things

87
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,789
I'll link some of the videos that I use

88
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:41,740
to learn how to do stuff just in case

89
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:45,580
here oh my god saved [ __ ] hey come dance

90
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,220
me that's right so this is a three step

91
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,570
motor this will activate this one and

92
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,250
then this will activate this one in this

93
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,250
so each leg at a time will it be

94
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,409
activated wait did I do it upside down I

95
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,699
don't know what it is with redstone as'

96
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:06,990
is so addicting why is a redstone

97
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:06,990
addictive it makes no sense okay so

98
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:17,330
so I built this yesterday but it's I

99
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,439
don't know it doesn't always work so

100
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,669
we'll see how this goes

101
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:24,680
Oh God like that so this activates this

102
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,509
this is stuck to this so this activates

103
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,129
the this and then this activates this so

104
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,449
it will be one leg at a time it'll be

105
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:31,699
epic but we also got to make sure that

106
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:37,879
it powers itself isn't that right Sven

107
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:40,849
yes see which will do like this and then

108
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:47,750
connect it with slime three two one go

109
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:53,810
oh don't ever do that again you scare my

110
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:55,669
meat it is it shower you would love now

111
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,500
this is the fun stuff this is the fun

112
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:01,430
stuff come on it will be epic and we

113
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:06,680
just need to add something to make it

114
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:10,580
push we shouldn't be too bad we just put

115
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,029
that there right that isn't really that

116
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:17,029
easy

117
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:20,389
oh my gold let's try it you see one leg

118
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,800
two leg one leg two legs epic so n is

119
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,930
following because he knows it's gonna be

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,120
awesome

121
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:29,120
so let's build our little little Smith

122
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,930
the legs I just realized I want to build

123
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,930
it higher up god

124
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:48,900
and what big legs cuz that's what I have

125
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:50,150
in real life I don't even care his leg

126
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,330
looks so dumb

127
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,290
okay Japan let's build the other leg

128
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:59,400
let's make sure they work

129
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:02,850
oh god it's fine you're very close to

130
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:07,500
that all right who's ready to test out

131
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:12,360
this thing let's freakin do this did I

132
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:17,420
forget to connect them again every time

133
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:25,680
oh okay

134
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:30,990
look it's walking dance legs I finally

135
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:35,060
made yeah they're beautiful

136
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:38,430
I finally had links it's the most

137
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:42,270
happiest day of my life never been their

138
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:45,200
proud event is so happy for me as well

139
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,200
Mike

140
00:07:46,690 --> 00:08:00,010
what there's legs in Minecraft oh yeah

141
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:06,400
yeah run over him kill him kill him

142
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:06,400
destroy destroy damn it

143
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,990
creeper creeper is equally disappointed

144
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,630
I'm starting to realize in just the

145
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,180
absolute grind the absolute grind for

146
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,370
Redstone engineers like Jesus all right

147
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,030
I do want to build a can so let's see

148
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,110
how I would do that well this turned out

149
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,820
a lot more complicated than I thought

150
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,680
okay it's fine I don't care

151
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:31,760
think I'm running out of brainpower I

152
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:43,099
don't know what happened to me this

153
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:45,320
should not be that difficult this is so

154
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,600
convoluted I cannot believe it

155
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:53,839
and it doesn't work either so that's

156
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:56,150
always good I think this will work did

157
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:01,820
it who knows

158
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:02,650
god it's so big is it no it's not

159
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:11,020
working

160
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:13,550
did it work I think it is working I

161
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,870
might as well make it in a horse at this

162
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,330
point because that's what it looks like

163
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,330
anyway this is the front paw

164
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:27,459
did I delete the motor

165
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:31,149
oh I deleted the motor by accident I

166
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:33,470
don't think that's supposed to happen I

167
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:35,660
don't even know what I'm looking at

168
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:45,740
anymore I'm trying to recreate what I

169
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:48,399
made I did not expect to be a little bit

170
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,350
freaking Oh God

171
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:55,339
the effort smash like on this video for

172
00:09:51,350 --> 00:10:04,610
the effort the absolute effort what is

173
00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:05,959
this it should work yeah so I'm pretty

174
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,180
sure I've never spent this much effort

175
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:11,350
on anything in my entire life I thought

176
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:16,269
this would be an easy little pill that's

177
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:22,430
becoming very very very very convoluted

178
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:23,629
it stays it's so ugly oh all right I

179
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:27,680
don't like a face

180
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:31,129
god damn do I have a lot of regrets

181
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,279
absolutely but is it too late to go back

182
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:40,009
