at and FISA and her relationship and oh

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:49,379

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:54,120

11
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:56,370
of that and FISA wants all of cortex

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,530
money and she's not even trying to hide

13
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,870
it and it's goddamn beautiful let's

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,170
freakin do this so we started with

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:16,310
George and Anfisa going shopping for a

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:16,310
wedding okay

17
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,400
when I told fisa I can't buy something

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,650
she's not really good at compromising so

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,759
to give context on this relationship he

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,790
has his own business

21
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,909
something marijuana related and he's

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,530
making a decent amount of money but I

23
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:37,439
know we're neared the expectations of

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,290
what and Fiza wants basically and she's

25
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,570
very upfront about the fact that I am

26
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,390
gonna be your wife for the money now

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,820
this is a three carat ovum and just so

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,110
you get an idea this ring is gonna be

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,760
about $75,000

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,760
[Music]

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:04,000
seventy-five thousand okay nice great

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,710
okay well there's there's ovals let's

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,020
see something like this on your hands

34
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,400
round diamonds are probably the most

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:15,010
popular instead of going what actresses

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,690
once and what's most popular why don't

37
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,650
you just pick a rink that you've got

38
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,000
them like okay what about bigger what do

39
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,790
you think about when that's in the five

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,830
carat range just to see now that one's a

41
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:35,460
much more square shaped cushion so the

42
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,930
retail on this is three hundred thousand

43
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,120
three hundred thousand

44
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:47,410
it should be legal to buy rinks that

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:49,630
expensive why I like it I like it now

46
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:54,550
that I heard the price of it now I like

47
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:57,640
it she's French we should be able to do

48
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,620
this for 150 for you that's a pretty

49
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,040
good deal maybe you should him alright

50
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,230
okay that's a steal you want me to buy

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,590
something outrageous that's a steal I

52
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:13,090
save hundred and fifty over under fifty

53
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:25,830
as soon as he said I even I was like

54
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:28,450
yeah sure saying three really quick I

55
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,980
think the ring shows how much he'll ask

56
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:34,570
me yes yes yes that's how that works

57
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,910
absolutely the ring and only the ring

58
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,040
will determine and actually not even the

59
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,170
ring just surprise of the ring if he

60
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,870
proposed to me with some cheap ring I

61
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,910
think I'm not gonna marry him I think

62
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,310
I'm not gonna do it good good for him

63
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:51,730
then please for the love of God don't

64
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:54,480
marry this woman that's too much happy

65
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,480
wife happy life

66
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,290
is there a comfortable budget that we'd

67
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,290
like to sort of stay yeah they said 30

68
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:06,439
every what was it 15 or 30 I'm sure

69
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:09,140
we've kind of had a budget from 35 to 45

70
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:11,060
there you go fantastic you can find

71
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,950
beautiful things in that range you're

72
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,859
going to have to sacrifice a little bit

73
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,289
in the color and the clarity basically

74
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,570
where you sacrifice is if you put like a

75
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:22,580
magnifying glass to the diamond then you

76
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,199
might not see a tiny little spot or not

77
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,650
that's the difference in these things

78
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,990
I know because I bought one I mean

79
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,180
there's one thing about being reasonable

80
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,440
and one thing going over budget and one

81
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:41,720
thing making me a slave for the rest of

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:45,620
my life like a no reaction from her

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,650
about that you want to be in crippling

84
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:53,060
debt for the rest of your life thanks to

85
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:55,340

86
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,530
believe this but I can't get her a ring

87
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,289
that's gonna take me 50 years to pay off

88
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:04,400
I think we need some time to think maybe

89
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:07,729
I will be able to make him get something

90
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,889

96
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,139
of a symptom

97
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,030
so first he got kicked out of bed

98
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,710

our argument at the Russian restaurant

105
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,570
my head's been all over the place you're

106
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:12,760
basically saying they were just dating

107
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:13,870
me because I can buy you things I mean

108
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,700
at least she's honest

109
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,620
at least she's upfront about it what

110
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,120
goes through this man's head I cannot

111
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,220
understand it this is his first

112
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,820
girlfriend or something but I love her

113
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,580
so much

114
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:28,150
she's my soul mate she treats me like

115
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,700
and once asked me for money I love her I

116
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,830
need to marry her that will fix it I

117
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,910
need to give away half of my assets to

118
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:39,280
this woman that will fix the problem

119
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:41,729
what I don't understand it it is hard

120
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,830
being with somebody that thrives on

121
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:47,289
conflict like that but I really want to

122
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,110
have a rational conversation to find out

123
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:52,290
where things stand

124
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,960
because I love Anfisa why because you

125
00:06:52,290 --> 00:07:04,410
got fake boobs and fake lips is that all

126
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:08,750

127
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,750
can't fix it you can't fix stupid

128
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:19,470
she respects him in no way whatsoever

129
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,840
it's so clear I don't know I think he

130
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:25,350
doesn't really realize that it's hard to

131
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,280
be in the foreign country where I don't

132
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:36,960

chance to do that I don't know what

199
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:07,740
would cause anybody to flip out like

200
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:10,560
this and visa refused to allow cameras

201
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:14,520

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:23,160
packed and things I wants a postnup show

205
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,780
agreement why does she want it wouldn't

206
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,450
she be better off so they got married

207
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:31,590
Oh George she got married if I want to

208
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:34,020
be married to a liar why George was

209
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:37,560
supposed to tell me everything about him

210
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,270
his finances but he doesn't and then he

211
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,980
asked me how am I not sure if I wanna

212
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,040
stay married to him that's exactly why

213
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,980
the only thing I wanted on the agreement

214
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,810
is about the debt and that's all I know

215
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,180
that's right that's the only thing you

216
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,100
care about because he's in depth thanks

217
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,630
to you and now that you're married you

218
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,250
will technically all the same Depp

219
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:00,990
doesn't it because you share all their

220
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:03,510
money yeah not gonna agree to anything

221
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,010
else it is unfair that he's trying to

222
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,710
put the stipulation in the past not

223
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:17,100
because I think I deserve more than 50%

224
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:23,990
no matter what but then it spends my

225
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:27,360
money so what so what

226
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:30,450
mentally twelve-year-old Jesus Christ

227
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,870
you yeah you deserve this you got into

228
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:37,290
this mess the signs were all there they

229
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,350
were all there and you kept going for

230
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:43,820
whatever reason he decided to marry this

231
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:46,980
woman he yeah

232
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,230
this is the worst person I just don't

233
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,180
think it's hair what you want well if

234
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:55,290
you don't think it's it's fair then

235
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,940
let's be fair let's put on the post know

236
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,220
that you're gonna buy me a 100 thousand

00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,680
drink like a promise me she should

238
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,290
respect me that's more fair she makes a

239
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,600
good point with seeing how she's acting

240
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,300
towards all of this makes me realize

241
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,840
that I need to be careful I'm not gonna

242
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:18,990
screw now because you you want to be

243
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:24,300
happy I'm agreeing to certain things to

244
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:32,160

245
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:34,920
him to know this jeez that was so out of

246
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,720

call the cops for domestic violence at

248
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,170
least they got that on tape dude she's a

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:46,020
sociopath she's a psychopath we just

253
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,920
what maybe let him finish his sentence

254
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:06,810
this is in saying I never seen such a

255
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:13,100
psycho couple a I'm traumatized I'm

256
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:13,100
scared but also extremely entertaining I

257
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:43,430
can have a key yes you can have a key

258
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:51,000
George was late

259
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,370
we were late because of you he's not

260
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,500
very functional I always have to wait

261
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,480
for him that's terrible

262
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,650
I can't believe he's not punctual oh

263
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,200
you're bad

264
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,300
attributes really they match up with not

265
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,100
being very punctual you're right it's

266
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,140
terrible I feel for you and please I

267
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,530
truly do we're going into this interview

268
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:13,860
to show that we're in love and how but

269
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:16,580
good luck that the fight is a bad

270
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,580
example

271
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:22,649
Zana that works yeah I guess you have to

272
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:30,209
prove that you're actually a couple yeah

273
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:31,910
that would be tough he's driving so the

274
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:35,819
drug there's pretty nerve-racking

275
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:44,970
arguing about traffic and if we're gonna

276
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:47,009
be there on time oh nice nice verbal

277
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,050
abuse epic even though she jokes about

278
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:51,089
it all the time on the back of my head

279
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,480
I'm worried what happens after she gets

280
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,149
it

281
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,620
well I'm gonna take a wild guess and

282
00:15:54,149 --> 00:16:00,449
she's gonna do exactly what you said

283
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,759
he's such a simp if I never seen this

284
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:07,769
imp there's big it blows methods this is

285
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:10,110
what happens yeah you're equally I mean

286
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:12,480
obviously the physical abuse really put

287
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,579
it out out of the line but before that

288
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,559
it's like you're playing right into it

289
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:22,110
as well and all honestly I am in a

290
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:25,050
little day what death what he became in

291
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:28,970
depth after buying me all the things

292
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:33,689
well I got in depth for us being married

293
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:37,559
tell me oh that's kinda messed up if you

294
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:40,379
think that before they get there now it

295
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:42,839
makes sense to plug the thick heads okay

296
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:46,319
okay okay all right it's just some

297
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,209
accounts that I fell short on before

298
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:51,480
getting married with thank you sure now

299
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:53,420
he's nice and sexy because I was

300
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,730
slacking

301
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,830
you just haven't been honest with me I'm

302
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,080
telling you now you should've told me

303
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,850
before I've always been honest with you

304
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,310
and you're always lied to me true she

305
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,839
has been honest I'll give him that

306
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,700
change and if you're not ready to adopt

307
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:20,390
it I'm going to adapt what isn't it a

308
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:23,300
Demidov - what - your lies that's stupid

309
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:27,560
and irresponsible of him I do

310
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:30,530
loke she writes validity doesn't she

311
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,690
the green card myself I'm entitled man

312
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,110
it all makes sense they're a different

313
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,410
breed

314
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,850
bring your fiancee from abroad and

315
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,500
getting married when you're in depth

316
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,150
when you don't have you together you

317
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,400
told me you have but you two love each

318
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,890
other I'm sure you can overcome this

319
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,890
little obstacle many families are in

320
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,640
depth in fact you'll work this out no

321
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,140
problem

322
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:56,300
he'll be great yeah give me whatever

323
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,820
else I think I quash she's in wrong

324
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,250
order that's why she wanted the post nut

325
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,380
wasn't fair for George to wait until

326
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,360
after I moved here to tell me that he

327
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,340
wasn't as rich as he told me before

328
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:18,980
business doesn't go all what you want me

329
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:21,260
to do about how much money I have but I

330
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,970
spent everything I had trying to impress

331
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,620
her it's a pretty smart business move

332
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,170
right if you want to get a girlfriend

333
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,670
out of your lien take out a dent and buy

334
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,680
her all these things and what then once

335
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:33,230
you're married you share the debt half

336
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:38,060
the debts pretty good nice move for

337
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:40,640
pretty good childish oh my god he talks

338
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,770
like jontron its child oh my god is John

339
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,780
Theurer sorry John I'm sorry but you

340
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:50,200
speak the same way this childish is your

341
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,200
ally

342
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,450
so now that our future knows that I'm in

343
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,950
debt I'm worried that she's gonna leave

344
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,680
me or fill me more in debt

345
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,840
either way so I'm gonna be good no the

346
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,030
first option pick the first option first

347
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,860
option please please pick that one

348
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,650
this guy will never ever break up with

349
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,750
her no matter what he's so stuck does he

350
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,960
not have family that tells him I i watch

351
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:16,000
the first episode with him and I know he

352
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,100
had sisters that were like thoughtful

353
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,870
about him being like are you sure but

354
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,940
they were still supported all right

355
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,220
couldn't they just tell him you need

356
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,290
someone to tell you cuz you're not

357
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,330
sometimes you get stuck in your brain

358
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,550
and you don't make any sense

359
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:37,420
with what you're doing and that's not

360
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:39,970
good I thought he was just trying to be

361
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:43,150
cheap and I didn't know that he's really

362
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,730
