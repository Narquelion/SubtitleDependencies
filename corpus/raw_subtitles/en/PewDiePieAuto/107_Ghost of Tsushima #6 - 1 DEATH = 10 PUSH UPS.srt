watched it [ __ ] until like i actually

261
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
saw on

262
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,120

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000

267
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,199
yeah the part where uh for those of you

268
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,600
don't know

269
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,199
it's an and it's actually well animated

270
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,040
but i didn't want to watch it because

271
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,040
i just heard it was edgy which is like

272
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,160
the japanese term for a little perverted

273
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,199
but not

274
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,759
no no yeah no actual nudity but i think

275
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,720
prison

276
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,360
school really like pushes it as far as

277
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,040
it can go with it

278
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,240
uh but it's actually very [ __ ] funny

279
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,759
it makes me laugh

280
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,279
a lot out loud

281
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,279
especially the part where

282
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,839
um in the first

283
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,920
in the first episode where the the

284
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,480
the girls torture the guys and make them

285
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,839
like spit on their face

286
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,480
and and uh

287
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,079
makes the the girl makes him lick his

288
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,199
boot and then the guy interrupts him be

289
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,919
like you don't have to sing

290
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,520
come on don't do this this is too far

291
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,480
and then they get pissed off for

292
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,280
stopping her

293
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,760

they made another series it's like

319
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,480
alternate timeline but it's not as good

320
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,720

so [ __ ] complicated

866
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:08,839
test the way all right yeah that works

867
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:10,960
and then i'll put testing

868
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:13,359
testing it's literally because i plugged

869
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,440
in my

870
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,119

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:39,839
why i have like 50 audio output

876
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,240

880
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,920
is it the new windows update like what's

881
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,920
happening

882
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:21,839
i can't even hit the [ __ ] start

883
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,839
button without it lagging

884
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,640

889
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,839
inconvenience it's just i

890
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,599
don't know this movement things should

891
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,200
be easy and it's become so [ __ ]

892
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,200
complicated and i don't understand the

893
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,720
reason why

894
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,640
bill gates needs to come in here and

895
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,720

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,000
i don't think it's that much but that

897
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,559

00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,000
why it shouldn't work

907
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,000

00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:13,359
really half or like the

937
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,079
uh what do you call them the presets how

938
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,760
about you think

939
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,680
before you open your [ __ ] mouth how

940
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:23,839
about that

941
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,839
no i just think what i thought i'm sorry

942
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:30,480
what is it uh which obs

943
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,040
do you use just regular obs or the

944
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,359
streamlabs obs

945
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,640
obvious studio okay

946
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,160
okay look at my options down i got a

947
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,839
different one see as soon as i quit it

948
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,960
works fine

949
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:46,160
yeah but i've streamed i've streamed

950
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,720
rocket league many times on this

951
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:52,640
computer yeah well

952
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,400
it's because like the newer versions

953
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,800
come in quality preset

954
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,240
do you know what i'm talking about yeah

955
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,960
is do you have it set to like higher

956
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,760
than

957
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,640
just normal you can also just control

958
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,720
delete and you know look at your

959
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,210
processor and see if it's like

960
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:11,219
a gpu or anything's being overloaded

961
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:11,219
[Music]

962
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,640
and then you can figure out the problem

963
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:21,920
from there i'm sorry for yelling before

964
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:25,119
i feel bad now go menacing

965
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:30,839
song but at me i don't give a [ __ ] okay

966
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:33,839
i'm used to it he's always like this

967
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,839
channel

968
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,319
uh what is in my output settings

969
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,960
um should be like under output and

970
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:47,119
streaming and then uh

971
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,480
i i use a different obs so i can't tell

972
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,920
exactly where it is but

973
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,680
it should be under like a preset like

974
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,720
quality or uh

975
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,960
fast very fast

976
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,800
slow it depends on what the process it's

977
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,119
some quality right now

978
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,240
some quality did you control delete to

979
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:07,119
see if anything was like having trouble

980
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,240
look at your uh whatever the [ __ ] it's

981
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,960
called

982
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,680
you look task manager and uh your

983
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,839
processors

984
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,839
and performance and like crap

985
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,559
not responding not responding

986
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,079
your task manager's not responding do

987
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,280
you have a windows update because i had

988
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,559
one before we started

989
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,440
yeah you do have a windows update

990
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,920
it's using fifty percent of my cpu

991
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,800
sixteen percent memory

992
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,800
what about your gpu

993
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,079
50 50. did you say you have a windows

994
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,119
update

995
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,960
yeah well that's actually

996
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,240
honestly probably what it is

997
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,079
[ __ ]

998
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,000
i don't know why but windows updates are

999
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:00,079
like dick your whole computer

1000
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,079
up when you try to stream [ __ ]

1001
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,359
those god damn

1002
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,400
let me try one thing okay um

1003
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,319
i think it it could just be what my

1004
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,920
encoder is

1005
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,079
yeah as well as the next question let's

1006
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,599
go ask you use your gpu or your

1007
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,119
cpu to encode all right i'm gonna stop

1008
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,160
the stream one second don't go anywhere

1009
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,400
crazy my stream's still on okay what are

1010
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,880
you implying i say crazy [ __ ] cause i

1011
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,880
you know i don't you know i never say

1012
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,079
anything

1013
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:41,839
i was playing the [ __ ]

1014
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:46,000
i use um the nv enc encoder

1015
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:46,000
me too you use it as well

1016
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,839
i think that was the issue yeah i mean

1017
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,240
if you turn your stream off you might as

1018
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:55,200
well just windows update uh

1019
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,200
it's probably

1020
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,290
so much yes like how many tabs you got

1021
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,680
open

1022
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:07,839
[Laughter]

1023
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,839

00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,720
all right youtubers we have at least 50

1025
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,680
tabs open with potential videos in the

1026
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,480
future that we're going to do

1027
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,000
all right all right it seems to be

1028
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,079
working fine now i think i just needed

1029
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,520
to restart obs

1030
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,400

1032
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,680

2347
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:59,920
