00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,910

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,719
about you to rewind 2019 edition I have

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:14,940
returned from exile Thank You YouTube

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:16,770
gods I exist now after two years of

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,140
being excluded in YouTube rewind and

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,680
complaining about it every possibly have

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,730
I am finally in YouTube rewind this is

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,859
so awesome

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,130
everyone is gonna love YouTube rewind

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,130
now that I am in it oh no oh God

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,920
despite YouTube's best efforts YouTube

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,680
rewind is still a disaster this is so

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,410
sad FS in the chat they actually showed

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,750
me this rewind before I actually got to

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,210
see it and I got to give feedback on it

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:54,629
and they took some of my feedback but it

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:57,180
still bummed listen it's not my job to

18
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,030
create this video they just showed me

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,609
the finalized product okay this is not

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,320
how I would do it okay if I can control

21
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,960
rewind we'll get into how I would make

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,930
it regardless I do find it kind of funny

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,939
cuz it's almost like they try to avoid

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,740
all the politics that went on in the

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,000
previous ones of who they're gonna put

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,770
up there and who they're gonna celebrate

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,930
and what things are gonna celebrate and

28
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,369
they just said okay we'll just show the

29
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,280
top ones and then that way you can't

30
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,320
complain and I just completely backfired

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,040
and when I saw it I'm like oh that makes

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,320
sense actually

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,759
this way they avoid everyone complaining

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,829
about it cuz it's just the list

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,619
you can't complain by list this is

36
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,479
democracy this is what you said you like

37
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,310
this videos not does it's not our fault

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,170
yeah I actually have a lot of thoughts

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,640
on this we'll get into it I wasn't

40
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,520
planning to make a video on this because

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,920
just like everyone when you watch it the

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,200
reaction is this yet there's not much to

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,700
say about it it's kind of boring it's a

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,500
wash mode your video that's what

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,630
everyone's sentiment is when they react

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,890
to YouTube rewind but I thought let's go

47
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,780
through it anyway and I can get my

48
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,689
thoughts on it because that's the yearly

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,090
tradition of this channel

50
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,999
I find it funny that people thought this

51
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,439
is like a preview of rewind Hoover

52
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:15,870
didn't even realize it was the actual

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:19,290
rewind that is so awkward to watch that

54
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,470
bad word that's the first words I love

55
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,629
ITA's cringe answer so good okay don't

56
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,459
start with Casey Neistat I'm sorry I

57
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,830
like Casey nice that don't get me wrong

58
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,769
but he's been in every rewind ever at

59
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,360
this point and also him yelling kpop as

60
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,370
funny as it is that was not the cringe

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,319
is part of rewind okay it was will

62
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:42,720
submit going yeah if I got to control

63
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,030
rewind I would get get back will submit

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,370
and recreate that beautiful moment where

65
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,140
he goes yeah that would have been cool I

66
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,239
would have liked that Marquez did a

67
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,709
video with Will Smith even and made him

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:03:09,930
react to that meme I thought it was so

69
00:02:52,709 --> 00:03:15,780
gay good times and I brought you down

70
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:17,280
with me or this way obviously it's gonna

71
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,109
be hard to get people involved with

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,889
rewind now like no one wants to touch it

73
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,370
anymore

74
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:28,769
this curse object so I'm already going

75
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:32,579
off tangents that is so awkward to watch

76
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:35,579
YouTube rewind 2018 the most disliked

77
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,680
video in history on you it's it really

78
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,880
damn I didn't realize and 2018 we made

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,200
something you didn't like so into a

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,970
nineteen let's see what you didn't like

81
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,859
because you're better at this than we

82
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,599
are I know they didn't mean for this but

83
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:47,700
it does come across as a tiny bit

84
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,099
passive aggressive riding wording it

85
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,690
that way listen maybe if I was hired I

86
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,319
could have given better feedback all

87
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,560
right

88
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:59,069
I hate this click for the shoe it pisses

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,420
me off every time I don't know why I

90
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:03,430
think it's a cool concept though of

91
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,959
showing just the top ones I know

92
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,150
everyone hated it because it's like oh I

93
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,159
can just look that up but when I watched

94
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,780
through it I was actually surprised when

95
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,290
I saw some of the top videos I'm like oh

96
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,780
really damn we'll get to that I guess I

97
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:34,990
have no idea without the Jewess the most

98
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:36,370
like crater videos I don't know this

99
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,949
thing I don't know what to say about

100
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,360
this is there's nothing to reacting

101
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,340
that's why I didn't want to make the

102
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,960
initial ad I'm like I don't know hey

103
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:49,150
look at that the mainstream and I think

104
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,320
this video I think mr. Bies deserves to

105
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,289
be number one he had an amazing year

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,550
obviously but you know the title is make

107
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,259
this video the most liked video on

108
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,360
YouTube the whole goal of this video

109
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:01,240
this is not me being salty but I'm being

110
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,610
number one but the whole point of this

111
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,080
is to get that metric you know so it

112
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,419
kind of fits the whole purpose of you

113
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,699
made this the most liked video well it

114
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:11,800
doesn't give a genuine reflection of

115
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,710
what the year is that's my point right

116
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,510
it doesn't capture the moments of what

117
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,099
happened last year and I feel like

118
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,919
that's the whole problem with this they

119
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:22,990
try to avoid the politics which makes

120
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,970
sense but then you lose the reflection

121
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,770
of what the year it was and I think this

122
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,180
is a good example of that I don't care

123
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:32,169
about music videos I'm just gonna move

124
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:38,319
on most like dance videos

125
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:40,360
there's video games hey roblox is

126
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,319
apparently huge Jesus Christ what is

127
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:47,979
this game get on the free fire had 30

128
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:51,879
billion views what what this is like a

129
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:54,009
fortnight pub G clone and it has 30

130
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:58,800
billion views I've never heard of it

131
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:58,800
almost more than GTA Jesus Christ

132
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,890
[Music]

133
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:09,150
Minecraft's hundred billion baby goddamn

134
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,280
goddamn that's nuts

135
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,860
you know I always avoid the top games

136
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,990
like my I used to avoid minecraft and I

137
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,150
don't like fortnight because it's just

138
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,310
so lame guess mine crafting sort of

139
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,710
became cool again but still alright most

140
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,830
like beauty videos I guess they have to

141
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,020
have this cool I don't care let's move

142
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,550
on these new creator breakouts it's good

143
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,340
that they had this because obviously if

144
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,320
you're just with this topless format

145
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,670
you're just gonna get money the top

146
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,650
graders are gonna get monopoly and

147
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,090
that's not fair either industry plant

148
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,770
I'm just kidding

149
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,140
Oh through Gordon made it in that's

150
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,570
awesome again there's not much to say

151
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,180
about it and then they had the most

152
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:52,040
viewed creators as he landed two billion

153
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:56,130
what mr. B's dude perfect david dobrik

154
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,410
jelly two point five days an animation

155
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:02,280
channel had two point eight billion I

156
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:04,320
never even heard of that's nuts and I

157
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,210
honestly was shocked to see myself as

158
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:13,980
number one I didn't know four billion

159
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:16,560
brah four billion my videos aren't even

160
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,200
good how will people not realize this

161
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,110
yet then they had a celebration of of

162
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,110
random things like top female artists

163
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,370
and friends and furs middle east and

164
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,610
creator to hit ten million subscribers

165
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:32,030
and Carissa God said occasional yadda

166
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,030
yadda yadda

167
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:38,189
and you know I understand that it

168
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,469
doesn't really fit to put it decay in

169
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:42,419
there somewhere for those who don't know

170
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:44,999
it took it was a youtuber that passed

171
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,609
away last year he committed suicide he

172
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:49,529
definitely deserves to be recognized in

173
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:51,689
some way I understand that it doesn't

174
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,159
really fit in this format but they

175
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,719
should have made space for it in my

176
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,759
opinion I didn't even think about it

177
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:58,919
when I gave feedback to be honest but

178
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,089
it's still it's so obvious I find it

179
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,219
kind of funny because everyone's like oh

180
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:04,379
this is a WatchMojo video well jut watch

181
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:06,629
mode you've made their own rewind and

182
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,489
what they did was they rank the moments

183
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:10,379
that happen their personal favorite

184
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:12,389
moments and there you go there you have

185
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,479
an actual reflection of what happened

186
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:17,999
this year case I versus Logan and Peter

187
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,009
pie versus T series and look they made

188
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:22,289
space for ethic as well they've somehow

189
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:24,419
managed to do it so it isn't impossible

190
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,309
huh some other notes apparently

191
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:30,589
congratulations got more likes than

192
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:33,180
number eight but they didn't include it

193
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:35,279
okay so there was some politics involved

194
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,199
I've watched her last years as well and

195
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,479
oh my god it was so much worse than I

196
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:46,319
remember Jesus Christ

197
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,889
Oh God oh so bad and all the preachy

198
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:51,149
nests

199
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:52,889
and all the but I didn't think this year

200
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,689
was that bad that was my genuine

201
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,160
reaction I don't think it's that bad

202
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:57,689
I don't think it's that important I

203
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,309
don't think it's that big a deal but

204
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:01,740
clearly these videos have worked

205
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:03,990
themselves up to be something really big

206
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,120
for the platform it's almost like it's

207
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,370
become a way for people to just unleash

208
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,889
all their frustration with YouTube into

209
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,139
one spot like that's what it feels like

210
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,879
it's become let's read some comments as

211
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:16,559
well all the reason I watched this is to

212
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,069
see if they put Felix and Marcia's vet

213
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,629
wedding that's it last year we made

214
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:23,160
something with the most disliked so this

215
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,939
year let's try to break that wreck okay

216
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,149
all right

217
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:29,519
I feel like that'd be unnecessary hate

218
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,920
it's just like kind of cringe as well it

219
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,529
doesn't feel like our YouTube rewind to

220
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,240
me well no one likes YouTube rewind why

221
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,309
would they try and capture it but I

222
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,160
think that's the point people did used

223
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:43,740
to like rewinds like the 2015 one was

224
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,970
great people really liked it it was very

225
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,449
very popular

226
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,310
and that's crazy - looking back on these

227
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:53,069
but the problem is that along the way

228
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,259
these YouTube rewind videos became more

229
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:57,959
and more of an advertising reel and made

230
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:00,240
it so that we can only show that the top

231
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,009
friendliest creators and and look how

232
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,509
good we are I look how all the positive

233
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:06,389
things we come and it just becomes creep

234
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:08,759
preachy and it became cringy and it

235
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:11,069
stopped becoming a reflection of what

236
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,410
the year was and more just over hey look

237
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,269
how I look advertisers look how epic our

238
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,550
website this and it just became more and

239
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,529
more and more and more you know YouTube

240
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,149
probably spend millions and millions to

241
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,910
create these videos and that's an

242
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:25,829
investment for them to make so that they

243
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,800
can get more advertisers on onto the

244
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:30,660
platform but when in reality 2018 wasn't

245
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,610
a good year for YouTube a lotta created

246
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,230
who were frustrated and then shoving

247
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,019
this video into your face was probably

248
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,000
the worst thing you could possibly do so

249
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,220
it's like this year they just given up

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,870
on the whole advertising real thing and

251
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,149
you know people made the joke like what

252
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,920
I could have added this rewind do they

253
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:49,139
pay an intern 500 bucks or something

254
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,579
like that but obviously if they can't

255
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,139
make an advertising reel out of it why

256
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,250
would they spend the money on it and it

257
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,170
makes perfect sense from that

258
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,930
perspective they did engage with people

259
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,939
making fun of the rewind in the comments

260
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,129
on Twitter which I thought was funny Wow

261
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:05,519
YouTube rewind 2019 which is an upgraded

262
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:08,009
version of top 10 enemy list how are we

263
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,620
supposed to make me in Saturday's come

264
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:13,740
on peak 2019 mood being mad that youth

265
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,199
everyone didn't give enough to be so

266
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,300
good so true alright a couple things

267
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:19,800
Charlie pointed out I think pretty well

268
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,959
in his rewind oh yeah well because the

269
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,639
ship has already sailed people know that

270
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,769
YouTube is not out to make itself a

271
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,240
better platform for viewers or creators

272
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:30,180
they're out to make it better and safer

273
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,319
for brands it takes one click to figure

274
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,269
that out when you go to YouTube's

275
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,970
homepage when you're not signed in all

276
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:36,899
you get as a recommended or available to

277
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,360
watch right away

278
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,800
is Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Fallon slapping

279
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,800
his [ __ ] desk and piss in his pants

280
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,269
and that's what we wanted to came you

281
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,889
know but people know that's not the

282
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:48,990
truth Jack Sims also did a good video

283
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:51,389
where he pointed out like secretly we

284
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,250
want the cringe we want to see Keanu

285
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:55,600
Reeves say you're breathtaking

286
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,760
- baby Yoda and

287
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,560
we all love to hate YouTube rewind at

288
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,820
this point let's get real here so Ethan

289
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,760
got an email from YouTube about

290
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:09,279
promoting rewind if I am tweeting about

291
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,980
YouTube rewind and I asked

292
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,990
I need that pose a call to action

293
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,449
question to my fans like what was your

294
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,459
favorite part of rewind hashtag YouTube

295
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:20,500
rewind and then what people respond to

296
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,810
me and use the hashtag they'll get a

297
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,820
surprise and a delight someone from

298
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:28,380
YouTube will randomly select people that

299
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:31,529
respond to me to give them way for it a

300
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,529
fanny pack

301
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,329
wait so YouTube wanted Ethan to post

302
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,820
what was your favorite part of rewind

303
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:43,630
and the top comments will get a fanny

304
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:46,750
pack guys what was your favorite part of

305
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:49,240
YouTube rewind 2019 fanny pack question

306
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,279
mark so yeah that's pretty much all my

307
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,810
thoughts that I had on 2019 rewind I

308
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,510
know not very exciting but there's not

309
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,399
much to work with I wonder what they

310
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,459
should do at this point like what can

311
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,230
YouTube do to have a successful rewind

312
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:03,880
cuz clearly big done it before

313
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,709
I think that's literally it they just

314
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,230
need to go back to what it used to be a

315
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:10,630
reflection of what the year is don't

316
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,519
exclude creators and stop showing the

317
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,139
same creators over and over again I

318
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,810
wonder if they will actually go back to

319
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:18,370
that then or not it will be interesting

320
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,319
to see next year what they're gonna do

321
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,720
clearly this new format didn't work out

322
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:24,940
well but it's still didn't do as bad as

323
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,199
last year so hey that's an epic win what

324
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,600
do you think would make the perfect

325
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:30,220
rewind I think that's it yeah good just

326
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,750
go back to what it used to be but then

327
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,850
again how are you gonna get people

328
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:37,149
involved like if I got asked to be in

329
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,740
rewind 2020 I'd be like oh I don't know

330
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,350
about this you gotta you gotta have to

331
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,940
prove yourself first kind of yeah

332
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,639
alright that's it hope you guys enjoyed

333
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,310

video so next year we can be part of

336
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,839
rewind

337
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:59,279
for too long you have been farting in

338
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:04,610
the corner now you are entering a new

339
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,610
era where you shall crafts thy own poop

340
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:11,630
the hour of our spells and poop grades

341
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,630
is coming

342
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,570
marzia Edgar and buttons need you

the timer you will face but crawlers is

344
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,829
all about

345
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:31,190
when you are seated on the porcelain

346
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:33,110
throne where T is the game to play

347
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:36,970
I'm not supposed to have my opinion

348
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,970
about that but the prices
