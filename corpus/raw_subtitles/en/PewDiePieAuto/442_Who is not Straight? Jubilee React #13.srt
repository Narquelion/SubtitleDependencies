your videos

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,120
for those who don't know this the point

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,879
of this show is

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,399
why did i explain it it's so obvious

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,320

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,160
we brought together seven straight men

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,199

guess this guy

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,399
because he's clearly the one that's

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,199
dressed as the most stylish he's doing

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,840

think like it's

188
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,400
you could tell by someone yeah exactly

189
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,720
tell through their story

190
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,919
i don't get mistaken for being gay what

191
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
does that say about me

192
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,280
i mean how could you identify a person

193
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,880
by their physical appearance whether

194
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,639
they're gay or not i don't think that's

195
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,039
possible and that's the conversation i

196
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,840
tried

197
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,000
it's definitely possible because you all

198
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,280
just proved it by eliminating corbin

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,360
i feel like for this to be effective we

200
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,560
have to put everyone kind of in the spot

201
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,919
and like and then everyone else just

202
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,080
analyzes them

203
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,360
ask me questions you mean the point of

204
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,360
the show my dude

205
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,080
wait wait look at my eyes real quick are

206
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,080
you gay no

207
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:24,590
look at my eyes real quick are you gay

208
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:24,590
[Laughter]

209
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,479
because they don't know what the [ __ ]

210
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,360
they're doing this is so hard

211
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,240
i asked andy and just because it can't

212
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,840
just be like oh

213
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,360
everyone gangs up on one person because

214
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,960
like then the gay person has

215
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,840
a chance like hide in the shadows or

216
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,840
hide in the noise you know

217
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,879
it was they keep going with a looking

218
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
strategy seriously

219
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,479
it was if they're gay they're gonna act

220
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,440
different they're very like

221
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,879
you know 1960s like mindset in that

222
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,080
which is funny and i was like

223
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,440
i don't think we're gonna get anything

224
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,800
out of this i know i don't think so

225
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,879
either cena penis

226
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,720
i've seen multiple penises how how did

227
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,840
you feel about them

228
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,879
what is this strategy i can't

229
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,280
what did you feel about them

230
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,879
has this guy ever met a gay person what

231
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,720
do you feel about the penis

232
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,000
when was your first girlfriend my first

233
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
one was probably like

234
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,599
in college yeah it was it wasn't very

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,919
long though so yeah my thing could be

236
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,440
about i'm like muslim so my thing is

237
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
like it's just dating is just usually

238
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,680
very

239
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,440
unconventional and it's like very like

240
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,599
limited so i mean

241
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,240
is that a thing in muslim culture i'm

242
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,839
i'm basically mainly on his uh posture

243
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,760
and gesturing

244
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,440
i feel like as far as like religion goes

245
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,720
i mean usually is another thing where

246
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,600
it's like

247
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,160
really pretty devout i would say yeah

248
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
okay

249
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,360
like i grew up like going to the mosque

250
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,000
and everything it's a very like don't

251
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
ask don't tell

252
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
it's something that needs to be

253
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,000
addressed there should be a lot of love

254
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,320
coming out just in general you know it

255
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,800
shouldn't be something

256
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,600
maybe we were a bit we jumped the gun a

257
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,120

and then turns out i wasn't what would

300
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,079
that make you the mole

301
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,000
no way he went out he's definitely it's

302
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,680
not wesley raise your hand if you think

303
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,480
the mole is still in the square and you

304
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,240
would like to continue the game

305
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,079
you just gotta be safe the calling out

306
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,600
is so like bad i apologize but it's a

307
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,240
game it's a game you just say it i think

308
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,640
you're gay

309
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,360
right and so this is what i think

310
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,440
there's a lot of

311
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,120
dominating the conversation the body

312
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,680
language and trying to control

313
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,240
everything

314
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,839
i thought he was acting maybe too macho

315
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,240
okay maybe he is

316
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,920
over playing no i don't have a straight

317
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,560
role i don't think i'm going to look at

318
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
wesley

319
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,000
you know what really sucks about this

320
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,880

321
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
like we're not

322
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,519

323
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,519

324
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,640

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,440
you i don't think you're it

373
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,800
is that considered gay because that's

374
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,839
gay happiness like people might be like

375
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
yo that dude's a little too happy i'm

376
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,560
like yeah i am

377
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,279
that's a good thing i think the gayest

378
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,000
thing that is

379
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,200
so this is the weirdest episode we've

380
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,360
gotten so far

381
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,639
i can't believe this is just a bunch of

382
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,800
dudes that

383
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,480
are brewing it out it's so funny

384
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,800
everyone's like oh my god are you gay

385
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,920
and i'm like does it matter but how

386
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,279

it's all consent it's all consent no so

390
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,399
they're my friends if you do gay stuff

391
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,959

392
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,519

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,040
say that one again cheap what do you

396
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,079
what was eight if you do gay stuff like

397
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,079

398
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,560
where did they find this guy uh it's

399
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,279
such a good episode

400
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,320
i love it i remember in school like so

401
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,560
everyone

402
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,600
all the boys were teasing each other oh

403
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,320
you're gay

404
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,079
oh you're gay oh you're gay ain't

405
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,160
nothing wrong with being gay

406
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,079
even if you're not gay you know what i'm

407
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,480
saying and i'll tell you what

408
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,760
all the people that always went oh

409
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,760
you're you're gay

410
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
they are hiding in they are doing it

411
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,199
they're projecting it

412
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,920
at least that's how looking back out of

413
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,920
my class

414
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,120
the people that went oh you're good

415
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,560
they're the gay ones

416
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,920
just like taste and music you know i'm

417
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,120
like a beyonce fan i've been listening

418
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,399
to like britney spears since like day

419
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,839
one like that's the kind of stuff like

420
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
i'm just really into like pop music and

421
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
uh that's that's my thing i guess

422
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,279
now that makes me think he's not gay

423
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,079
anymore i don't know

424
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,040
if i do ask you yeah no homosexuality on

425
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,720
like the

426
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,160
like the muslim community yeah that's

427
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,120
fine i feel like a lot of religious

428
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,079
organizations kind of take that

429
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,519
conservative approach where they're like

430
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,440
okay you know just uh

431
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,880
everybody's allowed in the religion the

432
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
thing that throws me off about his

433
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,199
argument and i don't know if i

434
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,040
understood it correctly

435
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,240
but i think he was mentioning like yeah

436
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,000
i'm not gay because i'm

437
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,680
i'm par i'm part muslim or something

438
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
like that and they're not very accepting

439
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,880
of gay people which i don't know if

440
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,959
that's even true or not but

441
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,120
that was his argument but that doesn't

442
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,560
make him not gay that just makes him

443
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,240
muslim if that right i i

444
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,519
i think he i think it's him you can't

445
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,800
really so if you were would you be

446
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,880
comfortable like coming out

447
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,320
would i be yeah probably not just i'm

448
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,600
being honest for myself and just because

449
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,320
i know how muslims are like i probably

450
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,199
wow if it's not wanting to be alive

451
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,040
that's crazy

452
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:22,280
wesley and evan whoa

453
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,839
i don't like this game anymore can i go

454
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,839
[Music]

455
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
home

456
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,800
evan sorry dude sorry brother i thought

457
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,160
wes was definitely

458
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,800
the guy that's right i don't think it's

459
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,560
i wanted to split the money with evan

460
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,480
but if everyone else is being greedy or

461
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,759
so i thought then i guess i got to be

462
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,959
greedy with everybody else

463
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,199
this is what i'm thinking all right

464
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,800
because saying i'm muslim is like the

465
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,440
ultimate trump card of saying like

466
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,800
yeah yeah i get that yeah that's right

467
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
anyone could be a liar

468
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
and i was like that is such a strong

469
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,759
play to use it's either

470
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
absolute truth or it's absolutely a lie

471
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,079
because he threw out the muslim card i

472
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,360
don't want to be controversial so

473
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,720
therefore

474
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,839
he's trying to play it up and then

475
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
they're yeah you said nothing

476
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,600
controversial so far

477
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,360
he is what you're saying bro are you

478
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,759
just gay no but we can't

479
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,759

we're homies this is i'll tell you what

483
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,360
this is the only episode of all of them

484

i've seen

485
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,560

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,480
as far as i did in the game i feel like

497
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,519
i played that hand really strong and i

498
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,600

521
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:08,960
just went out four cups dude

522
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,960

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,000
blessed the entire time i'm happy that i

524
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,640
made it as far as i've made

525
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,600
it well done that got it right away and

526
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,039
there are some like

527
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,559
okay i know this is going to be high

528
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,120
inside i thought he looked gay but he

529
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,600
was too

530
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,640
like obviously gay looking that it was

531
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,320
like i don't know

532
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,120
there was never a point where i thought

533
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,360
evan was the all well there you go

534
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,799
you can't know if someone's gay or not

535
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,440
it's got nothing to do with your

536
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,120
appearance

537
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,440

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,400
jupiter well done and let me just say

539
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,799
again

540
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
whatever you preferences sexually ain't

541
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,799
nothing wrong with that

542
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,120
it's respect why don't they just ask

543
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,600
describe your ideal girl that's a good

544
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,320
