[Music]

Gaber keg now that I'm back things are

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,180
gonna become a lot more stricter no more

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,370
fun and games I got a family to provide

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,000
for now that's try to look how did you

21
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,610
get there

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,130
that's literally impossible all right I

23
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:27,010
want to start off just building just

24
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,619
easing into it building a little float I

25
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,250
want to build a boat I'm gonna build a

26
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:33,790
boat now

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,770
thank you I somehow lost the footage of

28
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:39,399
me building the boat we're just really

29
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:42,580
annoying I swear I built it no creative

30
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,920
mode no nothing I built that okay just

31
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,460
take my word for it just imagine like a

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,050
cool montage right now basically okay

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:54,610
I'm not gonna lie that looks pretty epic

34
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:56,619
I like it it's a Swedish Viking boat

35
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,200
technically this sail is something wrong

36
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,759
actually no it's on the right end it's

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,190
hundred percent correct and just how I

38
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:10,090
want it ah like if they're not it's cool

39
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:13,209
stop talking stop talking we work here

40
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:17,560
we don't speak embarrassing this is

41
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:22,709
embarrassing so I'm gonna be honest I

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,709
think technically no don't go through

43
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,380
spent you can't come with me to the

44
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,110
Endor

45
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,120
now I don't it's too dangerous we're not

46
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,100
doing it I don't even know if it's

47
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,140
possible for a dog to go today in there

48
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,860
you know I am sure it is possible but

49
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,980
it's a bad idea

50
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,900
stop Sven stop yeah I know I know you

51
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,740
missed me but I have to go to the Ender

52
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,460
on my own

53
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:51,860
so technically for me the series is over

54
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,770
it ended on episode 30 I want to keep it

55
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,720
intact that way you know in terms of

56
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,640
storytelling or whatever come back

57
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,680
please basically what I mean by that

58
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,770
it's just like things like there's a lot

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,240
of stuff in the game I can do but I also

60
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,980
didn't want it seem like I was stalling

61
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,200
defeat the Ender Dragon

62
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,830
when technically I could so I decided to

63
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,750
just do it so so basically to explain it

64
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:19,850
the series is over but the series

65
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:24,530
continues its like the OVA of enemy at

66
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:27,470
this point ok just see it as that we do

67
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,050
have a lot of stuff left that it's

68
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,600
obviously very integral to the game

69
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:35,000
which is finding an end city which is

70
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,370
what we're gonna do now all right gamers

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,910
I know I know I just got back I want to

72
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:45,050
find an end city which means we gotta go

73
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,280
back ok but actually before we go to the

74
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,860
Endor there's something I really really

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,240
want to try that I haven't done because

76
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,130
we're probably gonna travel through the

77
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,080
air now they're a lot more now and I

78
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,420
know the fastest way to travel the

79
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,090
nether span that changed my mind you

80
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,100
can't come with me let's go let's go

81
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:06,260
gamers lifespan come on

82
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:11,120
can I just I want ice basically but I

83
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:16,340
don't know can I mind this no why not

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:20,210
doesn't need to be pure ice what the

85
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:22,310
fact is that an end of my guy I

86
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:26,690
accidentally threw the ender pearl and I

87
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:29,990
spawned a creep 5% chance to spawn this

88
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:32,030
is a goal ender poo cool

89
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,200
all right I've been waiting to say this

90
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,200
for a long time

91
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:43,789
that's right we're gonna head off me and

92
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:46,610
my boy and find some ice just like old

93
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:50,330
times man just like old times look at

94
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:53,930
IKEA tower so go [ __ ] you know honeymoon

95
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:57,969
is epic and all but there's nothing like

96
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,969
going on a trip with your minecraft dog

97
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:08,409
now where was the ice I forgot nothing

98
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:08,409
like witnessing a sunrise with your boy

99
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:17,960
god damn I miss Mike the thing is like

100
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,479
clearly at this point it has peaked

101
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,479
summer's over the series technically it

102
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,340

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,370
suspicious - doesn't random thing and

211
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,310
it's just like real life if you find a

212
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:58,220
suspicious do always eat it Oh anything

suspicious - thank you and it's gone

217
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,360
those five seconds was epic so yeah

218
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,950
we're gonna capture every animal in the

219
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,210
game but we're also gonna capture every

220
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,400
enemy in the game

221
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,740
someone proved on the subreddit that you

222
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:35,260
can actually catch the ender dragon in a

223
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:37,760
boat and I'm like they did it in and

224
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:41,360
they did it in creative mode though but

225
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:45,650
that means it's possible where are we

226
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,180
what is this t-then nothing like taking

227
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:50,420
your polar bear for walk in the desert

228
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:57,790
only in Minecraft what is this why is

229
00:12:50,420 --> 00:13:02,000
this here a pool on stop that hop on in

230
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:04,870
polar bear more like oh god no no stop

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,120
crying start Oh God

232
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:10,790
he's alive there it is there's our

233
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,160
beacon of trust I don't understand why

234
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:19,610
he's resisting I'm trying to save your

235
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:22,850
life stop resisting all right since

236
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:30,470
you're a polar bear I guess you can live

237
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:36,560
here okay time to build out our ice so I

238
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:41,330
think you place them like diagonally and

239
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,610
the boat will work on y'all this is

240
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:47,230
scary like I should probably run this

241
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,760
through a test yeah no that doesn't work

242
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:54,500
so does these not have to be there Oh

243
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:57,910
God Oh God but if that's how it's gonna

244
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,050
be yeah that is that is how it works

245
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,540
okay maybe I can be able to safety

246
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,580
underneath or something oh god that's

247
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,850
uncomfortable this is the worst idea

248
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,180
ever

249
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:11,870
I don't like bridges and it has nothing

250
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,940
to do with history I honestly don't see

251
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:22,340
how anyone can like them how is that

252
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:24,930
there what hey hey oh stop

253
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:33,300

254
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:36,300
Oh might stuff all right I guess I'll

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:39,690

I have a lot more ice than I thought nah

259
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:55,340
we're gonna go so fast that flash will

260
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,340
have to change his name to not so fast

261
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:09,360
yeah now I really don't have to keep

262
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:11,790
going but I'm going anyway I want to say

263
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,770

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:18,180
we go

265
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:20,490
you ready for ultimate speed you think I

266
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,600
was fast when I used to potion of speed

267
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,070
or you ain't

268
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:39,530

00:15:49,709 --> 00:16:00,010
damn now that's fast I like that that's

273
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,470
awesome today we're actually exploring

274
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:07,839
something very exciting which is an end

275
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:14,740
City what their citizen in the end yes

276
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:16,290
ah okay here we go gamers oh my god this

277
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,640
is ridiculous

278
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:23,320
you guys enjoying your time here

279
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:26,079
you're free oh yeah you can get the I

280
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,329
forgot okay we'll get the egg later but

281
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,279
as you gamers can see there's something

282
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:31,750
over here

283
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,180
you thought the end was the end of

284
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:39,910
Minecraft well no there's a way to go

285
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:49,360
even further beyond would you guys free

286
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:56,470
creeper what here we go

287
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:57,640
oh man damn so if you go through here

288
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,850
and I think you have to throw an ender

289
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:06,510
pearl it's actually get in maybe there's

290
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:10,709
a way to use a piston to push you down

291
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,709
yeah wonder if that works actually I

292
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:20,800
just had a gamer pee you ever had one of

293
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:23,370
those to get the ender dragon egg so you

294
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,050
can hatch your own ender dragon

295
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:29,640
you got to push it with a piston and

296
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:32,430
then put a torch underneath I think that

297
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,260
was it I'm not entirely sure and I

298
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:40,250
should probably double-check here goes

299
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:44,760
nothing gamers okay it worked what

300
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:46,230
dragon egg that's so cool and I said

301
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,630
that in the most on a rhombic way

302
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,630
possible dragon egg that's so cool

303
00:17:50,810 --> 00:18:05,940
but it's epic it's a fake alright be

304
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:11,880
quiet because my question was fairly

305
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:13,050
simple can you push yourself down so you

306
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,780
don't have to use an enderpearl to go

307
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:18,380
through the Ender dumb ideas come from

308
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:23,430
dumb people everyone never forget II

309
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:25,350
would I do yeah and then we put this

310
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:31,220
here and then we can just walk through

311
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:39,500
right Hey look at that I did science i

312
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:47,520

baby

326
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:35,540
remote getaway cool you should probably

327
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,559
put a lever instead but you can't my

328
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:43,160
trick Bing bong Bing Bing bong okay

329
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,120
so excuse me have you seen your city

330
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,950
where you come from

331
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,500
we gotta find so let's just head in one

332
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:51,050
direction south there's n cities I know

333
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,530
there is we just gotta find them

334
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:58,070
hello I wish I could bring Garrigan here

335
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,940
what if you can make Jurgen fly that

336
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,100
would be epic

337
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,900
like a Pegasus listen Microsoft I'm

338
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,360
giving you these ideas for free you

339
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,850
understand this so I think NC is

340
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,270
actually quite rare you gotta be careful

341
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,860
in the end though cuz you fall down you

342
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:16,030
lose all your stuff which has never

343
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:19,580
happened to me of course but oh god oh

344
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:23,240
god do I not like this finger very

345
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:25,760
sweaty don't release your Shift key

346
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,230
whatever you do feelings oh my god I

347
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,630
just realizing it makes perfect sense

348
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,570
so the nether is Netherlands right and

349
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:35,900
the end is Swiss because there's cheese

350
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:40,280
everywhere so what we're looking for is

351
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:43,100
obviously an end city and in the end

352
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,720
city is where we'll find the alight tram

353
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,250
which makes it so you can fly in the

354
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,559
game how cool is that

355
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,020
I never use one before and I'm so

356
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,460
excited Felix when you come back to

357
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,580
married life what are you most excited

358
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,320

364
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,570
like bridges don't like cheese that much

365
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:13,370
either to be honest so this is a double

366
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:15,830
whammy I like it melt I like cheese melt

367
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:19,760
that okay sorry relax it's like they

368
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:22,460
they created the the nether right which

369
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,890
is awful and then they decided hey let's

370
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:29,160
make something worse

371
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:31,620
in Chief's I assume n cities are as

372
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,940
radars in other cities but you keep

373
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:37,650
going in one direction you eventually

374
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:39,480
find 100 that's another end portal and

375
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,049
they're men more like n they're mad am i

376
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,270
right

377
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:46,260
I wonder what happens if I feed a chorus

378
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:48,030
fruit to bang will he teleport so this

379
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:56,610
is basically another way back home if we

380
00:21:48,030 --> 00:22:00,960
get lost yes there it is finally I walk

381
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:05,610

and why does he look so sexy hey I don't

389
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:37,100
like bridges don't like them very much

390
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:41,250
because crossing bridges it's very tough

391
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:49,669
things can happen things can happen

392
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:55,020
Oh No Oh God made a lot of mistakes on

393
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:57,090
bridges in the past so therefore I try

394
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:01,010
to cross bridges very fast

395
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,010
