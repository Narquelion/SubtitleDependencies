about picking up an ar-15 and shoot down

41
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,000
it that was a little dark joke but it

42
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,100

64
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,670

you just stop inviting me what the

70
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,130
what's up with that I feel like we at

71
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:19,130
least have to acknowledge that this is

72
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,920
the superior one as long as we all are

73
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,170
aware then it's fine my parents telling

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,620

reasons to buy a 27 pounds bucket or mac

84
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,310

85
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:59,209

Tenma Tekken that's good

87
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,570
when you're trying to enjoy your

88

birthday meal and you see waiters

89
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:09,380
clapping and walking towards yeah I get

90
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,900
it now I understand what this face is

91
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,570
this is the I want something and I don't

92
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,910
want something at the same time face is

93
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,799
that an emotion cuz I I think that

94
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,180
summarizes pretty well like when you're

95
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,729
not invited to something that you

96
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,840
actually didn't want to go to that's the

97
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,990
face of you baby

98
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,250

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:38,840
new emotion this mean gets a it's

102
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,820
alright good I feel like it's only

103
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,040
natural for transition from this point

104
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,410
to my parents screaming at me that

105
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,590
violet that video games cautious violent

106
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:53,900
me building a house for my minecraft

ahaha me hosting a gay wedding for my we

108
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,790
must stop the glorification of violence

109
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,979
in our society this includes the

110
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:27,710
gruesome and grisly video games that are

111
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:29,539
now commonplace it really do be like

112
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,430
that one minute you're playing Minecraft

113
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:33,650
the next year showing your cat your

114
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,810
knife collection I'm shaking my head

115
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,260
otherwise I've said it did instead of

116
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:42,020
just shaking my head maybe a complaining

117
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,000
about violent video games me too afraid

118
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:49,190
to pick rude dialog options thinking

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,289
they gamers jumping from being viewed as

120
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,450
chubby 34 year olds in their mom's

121
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,990
basement to being viewed as terrorist by

122
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,789
the media Barker well wasn't it just

123
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,340
Trump that said it I'm confused

124
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:04,539
gamers portrayed by the media in the

125
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:07,520
2000s gamers portrayed by the media in

126
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:09,650
2019 things can change a lot in a couple

127
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,630
years I'm a u.s. politician what does

128
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,710
that mean it means he's afraid of video

129
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:17,630
games no it doesn't crack stop it

130
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,330
Patrick you're scaring in Minecraft it's

131
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,900
terrifying to be fair so that actually

132
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,830
makes sense

133
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:28,639
oh my god if the tweet is real Reggie

134
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:30,470
then Co Nintendo facts are facts yeah I

135
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,080
don't want to get too political this is

136
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,659
just a fun mean review show after all

137
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,530
but it seems irresponsible to take a

138
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:39,990
really complex issue

139
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,670
and just pivoted towards one thing I'm

140
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,800
not saying I have all the answers I

141
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,770
honestly don't know but all I do know is

142
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,220
that anyone that has played Sudoku needs

143
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:52,350
to apologize right now Jensi kid

144
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,630
develops asthma due to polluted air baby

145
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,230
boomer who freaked the atmosphere video

00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:06,180
move on next me I'm writing this meme a

149
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,370
pretty important me you know people

150
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,410
really undervalued the effectiveness of

151
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,450
shaming people it's a tool that is

152
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,250
actually very good so keep on shaming

153
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,350
people with bad opinions

154
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:27,390

it's okay it's not really that much of a

159
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,650
meme and it will probably be forgotten

160
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:41,850
tomorrow but it does make me laugh

161
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:43,710

just so it seems possible like a hundred

173
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,210
percent of dentists if that doesn't seem

174
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,130

199
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,480

241
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:55,779
wizard

242
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:58,420
ok this one I don't get it it looks

243
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:01,720
normal to me I don't see that issue

244
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:04,150
okay now they made it green so Steve

245
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,160
Harvey and I could share an M&M that's

246
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,380
all this is about they just made it

247
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,820
green so we could both be an M&M they're

248
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,890
just saving money that's all

249
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,160
the third one after the floating bottle

250
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,880

whoever patched this together is

256
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,530
definitely going through the ranch I did

257
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,020
not think Tommy the Train could look

258
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:37,660
evil but I think you got Tommy the train

259
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,720

260
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:44,140
me we understand each other I just need

261
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,230
to pack now the mustache okay this is

262
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,180
like taking the holder off your phone it

263
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,460
feels really good for about five minutes

264
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,190
but then you want to put it back on okay

265
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,020
what is this I'm pointing at the iron or

266
00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:01,660

Oprah if I'm right okay this is better

270
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,650
than the real sonic hedgehog and it's

271
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,590
definitely better than the one that they

272
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,900
made okay the ranch is definitely Paul

273
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,390
