66
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,940

okay I've never done this I'm a gamer

71
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,900
it's old gamer intuition that's all I

72
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,100
got

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,690
I haven't shown everything I've been

74
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,720
doing I've been playing offline for

75
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,810
hours and hours and I'm so hooked on my

76
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,170
crap but I haven't done any adventure so

77
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,270
I'm excited now to go on epic okay this

78
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,260
is working I think now we're just going

79
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,810
up again aren't we

80
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,110
what about this way I think we might

81
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:48,230
have to get a boat I don't like this

82
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:51,890
will you be a good boy Jurgen we're

83
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:58,010

84
00:03:51,890 --> 00:04:01,010
oh god stay you're how did I not bring a

85
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,920
shovel to a goddamn treasure hunt map

86
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,530
hunting thing this is what I get for

87
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:10,489
forgetting everything Jurgen stop

88
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,769
wandering off my guide I've already lost

89
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,590
your brother now down the hole you go

90
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:18,530
just be a good boy and stay in the hole

91
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,989
here I have a flower don't look at me

92
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,480
like that I'm sorry I have to that's

93
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,040
right well there's another City day

94
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,169
there's another city

95
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,220
all right Jer again don't worry I know

96
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:33,980
what I'm doing oh yeah ah my boat

97
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:39,380
where'd my Boca anyone no I feel bad for

98
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,800
uragan hey maybe we can trade with these

99
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,130
people

100
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,350
maybe this city is less lousy than the

101
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,680
other one the city is being under attack

102
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,750
alright then I won't go then okay so now

103
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,669
it would make sense that we just need to

104
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,620
go in this direction at least if you ask

105
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:57,080
me is it possible that the treasure just

106
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,450
underwater I think that might be a yes

107
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,790
there's what there's light under the

108
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,890

you're having an epic adventure looking

157
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:19,919
for minecraft okay so I don't know if

158
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:23,799
this is the most effective way to do it

159
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,789
knowing myself most no no it is why is

160
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:30,069
there no scuba equipment in Minecraft

161
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:34,120
they had nine years to add it my way

162
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:35,879
what an irony to dig up treasure map we

163
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,319
have to build

164
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,240
that's called a paradox my minecraft

165
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:41,860
children it actually makes it easier

166
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,110
with sand cuz then I can just drop them

167
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,569
drop them faster minecraft I ain't got

168
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,160
time not I feel like this is the time

169
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,689
where in my audience this is cringing at

170
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,579

282
00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:02,110
I'd feel bad if Jurgen wasn't dead that

283
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:04,460
needs to be suffering in this world so

284
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,340
apparently one block in in the nether

285
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:11,140
realm is eight blocks in the other round

286
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:14,630
so if I walk like this I open up

287
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:17,030
opportunity now hopefully all my stuff

288
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,700

289
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:22,730

297
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,090
