the one that went into the other cage is

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,280
most likely

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,960
so tiny that it could escape and then he

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,680
went to the other cage and then he grew

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,640
up in there

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,119
