4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,230
we're gonna save sonic once and for all

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,539
I know this whole sonic thing ain't over

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,149
done people are talking about it I just

7
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,910
really want to know for my own personal

8
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,559
reason accent hey how can we make sonic

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,350
right they decided that they're gonna

10
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,730
fix sonic I'm here to help I'm here to

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,960
give my ok I'm here to give my

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:53,309
suggestions on what that should look

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:55,680
like now first of all I need to find a

14
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,559
picture how do I do that I don't want

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,160
that one here we go okay this looks good

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,049
high-quality picture god I think first

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,260
of all I want to do what's obvious and

18
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,390
let's just see what he would look like

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,420
as a classic look I know people have

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:16,409
done this I'm just curious what to make

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,090
the eyes smaller later probably liquify

22
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,490
isn't the best way to do this that's

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,360
right guys I have saved Sonic you're

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,119
welcome

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,979
so I'm just placing it right okay look

26
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,570
how much better that looks I think when

27
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,369
I'm starting to realize there's as Sonic

28
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,460
is a cyclops

29
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:37,189
why is sonic a cyclops and why has no

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,189
one questioned this earlier do this

[Music]

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:48,750
I'm starting to realize maybe making a

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:52,530
perfect sonic is it so easy oh my god

34
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,390
that is very eerie Jesus Christ I'm

35
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,410
actually terrified

36
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:08,600
this will be the sonic.exe movie yeah

37
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:11,660
all right next up is the mouth Shirley

[Music]

39
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:21,690
what someone ruined the sonic franchise

40
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,910
what so obviously the eyes are little

41
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:29,040
thinner doesn't look really that good

42
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,470
really ugly them the noses then it was

43
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,750
looks so bad I think it just needs to be

44
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,670
a little more pointing and that's it

45
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,020
that's all they had to do I don't have

46
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,340
to do this bro I'm gonna fix the

47
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,040
nostrils because they pissed me off

48
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,780
they're disgusting don't give sonic

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,360
nostrils that's how you know they messed

50
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,750
up another error I just realized that

51
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,570
makes no sense why is the stomach and

52
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,480
the face different color fir look at

53
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:57,270
Sonic here they have the same all over

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:01,080
like why they never change that is that

55
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,709
legit just a mistake that's so stupid

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:09,060
look at this how hard it is oh how hard

57
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:12,720
is it they are fixed god damn this is

58
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,690
pissing me off it's not just the teeth

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,630
it's like the whole mouth then legs

60
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:24,720
there's Dee sucking lips dude so

61
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:27,300
uncomfortable so there you have it small

62
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,220
details very big difference I don't know

63
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,810
how they mess that up and honestly the

64
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,670
stomach thing blows my mind because I

65
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,460
just seems like incompetence more than

66
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,989
