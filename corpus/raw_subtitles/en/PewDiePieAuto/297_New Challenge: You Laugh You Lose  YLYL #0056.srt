2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:10,769
feared all along has to become a reality

the Internet as we know it is gone it's

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,950
obviously really upsetting I think a lot

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,199
of people don't know what's gonna happen

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,600
but people have been saying things like

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,580
now memes will be banned

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,810
now all this content from Europe will be

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,430
banned YouTube have been saying that

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,760
they might remove content completely

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,769

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,000
use a VPN especially for security
