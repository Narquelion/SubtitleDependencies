Edgar listens to my videos as well

whenever I do the intro he always sits

36
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,569
down because he knows I'm about to

00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:05,579
record and whenever I do an outro even

38
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,799

the tenth creeper explosion steak steak

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,519
will bring spend through I cannot deal

51
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,470
with any more you may take my horse you

52
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,950

53
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,840

54
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,090
water cow I don't care about water cow

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,459
no one cares about water count IKEA was

56
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,709
so popular in PewDiePie's minecraft a

57
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,040
series that they made one in real life

58
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,810
what why does it look fake though I feel

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,370
like maybe you guys can relate to this

60
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,840
but once you play enough minecraft you

61
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,049
look at certain structures and you're

62
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,109
like that would look good in Minecraft I

63
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:18,480
bet I could build that in Minecraft no I

64
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:20,250
don't have problem when you invite her

65
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,500
over to play minecraft but she starts

66
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:27,120
reaching for your diamond leg games

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,069
why are you near my feet can we just

68
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,759
appreciate the lines on the headset and

69
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:35,310
the chair could be what brought this has

70
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,290
to be experimentation how the Frick did

71
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:47,390
I do that

72
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:49,280
Oh No what you never played to pursue

73
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,049
Bellator I just realized I can

74
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,930
technically review the memes like this

75
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:56,329
and you will still see it so why not

76
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,200
there's a way Felix can bring a panda

77
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:06,200
home don't let this Diane Lewis what

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:09,829
okay no way that will what what with

79
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,680
femto why is he carrying baby

80
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:15,139
why is your getting grey with this thing

81
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,910
Jurgen can never target can never fit in

82
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:21,500
boat delete this right now this is fake

83
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:25,009
this is how you know it's fake

84
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:33,110
dinnerbone is near minus 200 oh I forgot

85
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:35,150
about that sad moment when Dinnerbone is

86
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,729
technically more safe at the bottom of

87
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,380
the ocean

88
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:42,020
it's not called being lost it's called

89
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,070
tactical placement Felix she's probably

90
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,070
thinking about the wedding

91
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:50,750
marzia she makes a church for watashi o

92
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,220
yeah cuz I I told you guys that it was

93
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,930
my dad's idea with the water sheep

94
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,789
Church which was a damn good idea

95
00:04:53,930 --> 00:05:00,380
because so far everything just it's

96
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:02,180
gotten worse you know I'm starting to

97
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,250
think that water sheep isn't such a good

98
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,010
person after all I don't know is it just

99
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,229
me or for tonight youtubers when

100
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,780
fortnight is losing popularity you know

101
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,940
what I'm something of a Minecraft

102
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,530
youtuber myself I mean I can't really

103
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,389
fault it I mean I guess I played it for

104
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,490
the mean but I haven't paid attention to

105
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,680
what anyone's doing and it's so goddamn

106
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,690
liberating Alayna t through a cat okay

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,440
great I don't care I just want to plain

108
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,789
buy boots in 2015 oh no it's really cool

109
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,199
to have an audience that enjoys what I

110
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:34,280
enjoy and I don't have to be playing

111
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:37,630
minecraft every day or some F in 2019

112
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,250
it's another beautiful day in Minecraft

113
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,409
this is interesting because how do I

114
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,060
explain this because this ties into why

115
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:47,060
I never played Minecraft because

116
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,599
minecraft became so explosively popular

117
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,669
right

118
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:51,619
and and and everyone would just play it

119
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:53,330
and it felt like people were playing it

120
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,619
just because it was popular and not

121
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,360
because they were actually doing it and

122
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:57,979
people literally base their entire

123
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,719
channel around Minecraft

124
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:02,809
I mean I'd literally done the same so

125
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:04,520
but it it's different because for a lot

126
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:06,379
of these channels that would be it you

127
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,599
know they play minecraft and they can't

128
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,729
move on to something else what I always

129
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:12,229
enjoy with YouTube was that I could do

130
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,249
different things and I still have an

131
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:16,099
audience doing different things

132
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:18,080
especially back in 2015 like there's so

133
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:20,539
many big minecraft channels then that

134
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,860
don't exist today because their work

135
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,330
didn't translate into other stuff and

136
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,339
eventually people get bored of it it's

137
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,990
not to rip into them but it's also one

138
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,369
of the reasons where I was like well I

139
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,789
don't want to become like that it seems

140
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:33,860
awful but then again Here I am you know

141
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,860
if minecraft gets boring I can just move

142
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,389
on to other things it will never happen

143
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:44,779

Fridays and that's a fact

312
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,639
Thank You metric very cool Peter by

313
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,930
doing there's 8,000 - content creators

314
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,970
mental health charity in honor of

315
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,100
etiquette that's sweet

316
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:46,279
yes I saw this and it was super helpful

317
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,709
Thank You Maxime zero I'm learning a lot

318
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:50,360
of our edge stones this next one really

319
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:54,170
really helped me that the block power

320
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,579
one yet no this one I didn't know they

321
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,040
could send a signal through a block that

322
00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:01,040
was really useful actually because then

323
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,199
you can power it from the sides super

324
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,910
epic having an iron golem that is not

325
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,279
yours could be dangerous bids if you

326
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:10,459
accidentally hit him Sven could try and

327
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,250
attack it and would kill when you think

328
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,870
it's when we lose against stone man get

329
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,639
out of here plus they keep despawning

330
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,709
because I keep forgetting to gave them a

331
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,720
name tag what's worse than heartbreak

332
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:26,420
falling into lava and losing your

333
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:28,880
diamond can confirm what IKEA Tower was

334
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,730
became so popular that it became a thing

335
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,380
in real life what people finding

336
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,209
purifies minecraft seed is just making

337
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,189
it worse for pews as he said he wanted

338
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,630
to give it after he had fought the ender

339
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:40,459
dragon so people wouldn't ruin the

340
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,259
experience for him since the cities are

341
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,639
now please don't ruin it for pills don't

342
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:45,589
worry about it okay I said in the last

343
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,000
video that I didn't want the minecraft

344
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:52,300
seed it sounds so weird

345
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,459
using my seed but apparently some very

346
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:58,160
nifty people figured out what my

347
00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:00,259
minecraft seed is just by pinpointing

348
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,600
locations in my map which is pretty

349
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,699
awesome it's pretty impressive

350
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,829
but ironically at the very same time I

351
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:08,180
send my video I that I don't want to

352
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:10,790
keep my seed because I don't want people

353
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,870
to spoil but no one's pulled so far so I

354
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,819
think it's totally fine

355
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,490
basically this means you all can

356
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:18,829
experience meetings juergen and spend

357
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,199
for the first time yourself when Felix

358
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:23,060
grandkids ask him if he knows who this

359
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,160
PewDiePie guy from their history

360
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,319
textbook is well of course I know him

361
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,920
he's me my gosh I really do look like

362
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:33,529
everyone that is terrifying Jurgen died

363
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,910
after exiting from the nether a place

364
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:37,190
full of magma box

365
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,949
