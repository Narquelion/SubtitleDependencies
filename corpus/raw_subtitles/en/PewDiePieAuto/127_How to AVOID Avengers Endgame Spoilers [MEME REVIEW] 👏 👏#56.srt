24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,840
that could happen in end game like

25
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,330
ant-man marries dr. Phil Elin must kill

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,189
Stannis start dropping these comments

27
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,409

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,630
know what the actual spoilers are

29
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,400
because they're spoilers everywhere okay

30
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,180

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,869
theories out there like famous and

34
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,030

35
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,060

for leaking Avengers endgame spoilers

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,110
Jesus Christ people take this seriously

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,600
now of course I never heard of this

41
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,640
website and I never seen any this photo

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,520
could be taken out of any context but

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,100
I'm gonna take it as fact this does put

44
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,570
a smile of my face she's wearing the

45
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,250

46
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,040
Carolyn's gonna put the Infinity

47
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,710
Gauntlet and end Ana's ass I thought it

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,659
said she's gonna put her hand in Thanos

49
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,360
and see that's another theory that could

50
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,640
be definitely possible in Jesus Christ

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,629
this is literally me if I saw brie

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,220

food at home and you know exactly what

150
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,110

152
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,699
