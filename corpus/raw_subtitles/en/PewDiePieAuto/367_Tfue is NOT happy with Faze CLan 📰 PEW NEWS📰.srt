00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,969

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,940
YouTube he is the fortnight guy right

11
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,660

worry

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,789
because t field is losing subscribers oh

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:57,239
my god what did T food duty food do

00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,000
people do what did T fo do oh well T Fuu

18
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,920
is suing face faves which is the client

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
I don't know what it is I never know

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,519
it's a fake I think it's a client see

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
how he has set a little logo there that

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,930
means he's part of phase that means he's

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,460
super good game super bro and now he's

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,470
suing them that's crazy

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,380
ever since T foo has stopped uploading

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,570
or doing his streams in the report it

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,610
says that his contract would face is

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,470
one-sided but I think the main thing

29
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,630
that people are focused about here is

30
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,549
the 80% thing one of the world's top

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,439
professional eSports players this soon

32
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,540
his gaming organization for allegedly

33
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:35,549
restraining his business opportunities

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,920
and taking up to 88% hey he's got my

35
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:42,540
glasses

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:46,049
daddy 80% so apparently phase this clan

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,240
this management forty few has me taking

38
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,030
84 she also said that they've been

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,850
limiting sponsor deals obtained through

40
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,649
this team basically he can only do bonds

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,570
are shapes through phase I think that's

42
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,500
how I understand it and if you spoke a

43
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,090
few days prior about sort of not working

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,939
with companies and you should just be

45
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,670
independent if you are in the World Cup

46
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,170
or you think you're going to qualify do

47
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,400
not signed in org

48
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,489
unless it says in the contract

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,519
that they don't take any earnings from

50
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:22,849
tournaments and if you're in a contract

51
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:25,250
that says that you need to get a lawyer

52
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,420
and get out of that contract oh my god

53
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,860
that's what he's doing

54
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,629
TV you did say though that he was

55
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,790
getting all his prize earnings I keep

56
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:33,769
all my earnings yeah but why are other

57
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,079
people mad at T few then they makes

58
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,450
enough sense if they take 80% that's

59
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:41,030
really bad he also says that he was

60
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,579
reportedly pushed into living in one of

61
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,430
the group's LA homes alongside other

62
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:49,280
young Selim's nobody literally nobody

63
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,799
not a single soul t phew they forced me

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,540
to live in a mansion for free how could

65
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:55,519
they I mean he could have been

66
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,430
threatened or oh if you're not part of

67
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,530
the thing then to be fair I we don't

68
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,930
know what's going on and he gets even

69
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,299
weirder he also says that he was

70
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:08,450
encouraged to drink alcohol while

71
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:10,430
underage TV was 20 years old at this

72
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,829
time shut the [ __ ] up okay you're

73
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,940
drinking already people were very quick

74
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:19,190
to point this out even in his own videos

75
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:23,319
yo what the there's snow up here yo guys

76
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:27,579
I don't really drink but I am having

77
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,579
sounds what a drinker would say

78
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:38,569
according to the ni a a a 60% of the you

79
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:40,790
admit to drinking at least one by the

80
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:43,579
time they're 18 years old now I would

81
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,849
never absolutely never encourage

82
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:49,699
underage people to drink but it's also

83
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:51,650
you're full of bull whip crapper he also

84
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:54,530
said that he was continuously pressured

85
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,870
to perform stunts in his video like why

86
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,540
is are they bringing this up in a legal

87
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,340
dispute it really seems like grasping

88
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,590
for straws if you bring this up and face

89
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,319
bank one of the founders of faze

90
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,480
addresses as well [ __ ] sicko jump off

91
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,090
the [ __ ] you've been doing that far far

92
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,470
far before you met us and the first

93
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,940
thing you did when you came to LA the

94
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,109
very first thing you did was you brought

95
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,970
us all up to the reservoir and you

96
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,769
jumped off of the Hollywood reservoir if

97
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,959
anyone was pressuring anybody into doing

98
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,540
that it was you pressuring Tommy his

99
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,550
brother gwit into doing it

100
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,650
if you don't jump you got to jump with

101
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,800
one of us huh got him

102
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,650
apparently face banks and tea fewer

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,560
friends and he got very upset about this

104
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,000
lawsuit seeing it as a big betrayal and

105
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,400
I think that's why this whole story

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,130
really blew up so much and banks

107
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:46,930
addresses the whole 80 20 percent split

108
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:49,030
saying that absolutely 1000% untrue the

109
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:52,620
short answer is we have collected and

110
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,300
earned $60,000 from tfoo since we

111
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,530
originally started our relationship

112
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,750
which was about a year and a half ago

113
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:02,050
well that's obviously not 80 percent I

114
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,000
don't think that's 80% of what T foo

115
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,850
makes in a day so basically saying that

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,380
old faces done is collect sixty thousand

117
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,330
from him which has been through brand

118
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,680
deals and in those brand deals they

119
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,540
haven't taken eighty percent they've

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,290
taken twenty percent we should still in

121
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,790
the higher end but it's not that bad but

122
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,460
I think the important distinction here

123
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,500
is that on t fuse contract it says that

124
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,760
that they can take eighty percent it's

125
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,030
just the fact that they haven't done

126
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,980
that but contractually I understand why

127
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,690
he wants to get out of this contract it

128
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,120
sounds like a bogus contract if that's

129
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,550
the case plus the fact that he seems

130
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,440
like he's exclusive with phase X well as

131
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,900
well he's obviously missing out on other

132
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,570
deals there and the fact that any deal

133
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,240
he takes they will take 20% it's not

134
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,910
that great of a deal sure 20% it's not

135
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,180
terrible but it's not great either

136
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,980
ajan this kid has made a gross amount of

137
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,950
money and we've collected a grand total

138
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,400
of $60,000 from him it is a good point

139
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,470
though what is he complaining if they're

140
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,270
not taking any money from him sounds

141
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,580
like a pretty good deal a lot of people

142
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,120
point out that by looking at the stats

143
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,820
of when T few joined this client to how

144
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,660
that blew up his career here on April

145
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,190
30th he joined phase and you can see

146
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,500
same month is when it really started

147
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,330
skyrocketing now obviously just looking

148
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,030
at a stat and saying okay well he joined

149
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,390
here so therefore all his successes

150
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,340
thanks to face but banks even brought up

151
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,440
a lot of example in his video of how

152
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,210
much they've done for this kid you're

153
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,800
the captain I trust your judgment

154
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,419
I trust your call I want you to have the

155
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,550
roster that you want but with that being

156
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:41,740
said please play with my homie T foo

with him give him a chance and cloaks

159
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,509
response to that was something along the

160
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,550
lines of I know who he is we're not

161
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:50,050
interested Turner knows how to get kills

162
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,550
but he's not good at building we have

163
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,020
this person this person this person this

164
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,120
person in mind he don't want to play

165
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,690
with T foo again I pushed him yo just

166
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,639

00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,919
just please scrim with him just give me

168
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,629
that much that's all I asked and he did

169
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,550
the rest is simply history they played

170
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,440
together and they crushed it they won

171
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,270
scream after scream and they were stoked

172
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,620
everyone was like this is really where T

173
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,729
foo started to really make his name

174
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:15,280
banks lists a lot of reasons why what he

175
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:16,990
did to help T few flustered man like

176
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,780
have this kid's name tattooed on my

177
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,849
[ __ ] leg like imagine how dumb I feel

178
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,280
right now

179
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:26,590
so in The Hollywood Reporter we get some

180
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,990
word from T food more about his

181
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,030
perspective on the whole thing and what

182
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,069
they say is that he's only gets to keep

183
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,319
20% of the revenue from it from any

184
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:36,669
branded videos it seems so far that

185
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,710
that's false missing out on

186
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,990
opportunities okay I understand and

187
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,430
apparently he attempted to terminate the

188
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,949
agreement claiming that faze clan

189
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:47,229
breached their deal but they rejected

190
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:50,020
his decision and he's also seeking

191
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,090
punitive damages against face Kline

192
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,840
apparently faze clan offered a

193
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,759
seven-figure bonus and taking 0% but

194
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,889
they've been rejected I think the

195
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,169
emphasis here is on how they say

196
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:05,440
collected right and we've collected a

197
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:08,500
grand total of $60,000 from him we only

198
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,449
collect them 60,000 that might mean that

199
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,310
they feel like they at any point

200
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,440
I mean contractually at any point that

201
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,259
can say hey actually according to this

202
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,360
deal that we have you're signed for 8020

203
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:21,460
we can take that money contractually

204
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,080
they have every right to do that but it

205
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,500
seems like they had more of a trust

206
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,520
relationship in terms of me

207
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,250
renegotiating a contract when you're

208
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,169
already locked in it's not a good place

209
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,209
to negotiate so I always understand

210
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,919
despite being offered a big deal why you

211
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,209
would cut this contract I think we're

212
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,329
the reason why a lot of people are upset

213
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:41,919
is for all those dumb reasons that they

214
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:45,100
added along with this like the stunts

215
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,930
and alcohol and also it seems from what

216
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,139
we can tell the betrayal of a friendship

217
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,050
but then again we don't really know too

218
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,420
so I don't know T fuse law firm are

219
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,670
sending a message the time is now for

220
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,259
content creator gamers and streamers to

221
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,569
stop being taken advantage up through

222
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,970
oppressive unfair illegal agreements yah

223
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:05,100
I mean the thing is I agree with this

224
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,129
but it's all this is all done in the

225
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,800
completely wrong reasons most networks

226
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:12,509
that exist right now most management

227
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,540
through YouTube have completely fallen

228
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:17,399
apart because YouTube finally made it so

229
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,139
you don't have to depend on them when I

230
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,579
started I'm still salty about this

231
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,309
because when I started off there on

232
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:25,769
YouTube I had no choice but to sign up

233
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:27,569
with networks that were so lucrative

234
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:29,790
they would give you actual illegal

235
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:31,980
contracts and they would take fifty

236
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,120
percent of your revenue because you it

237
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,550
was that or nothing

238
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,040
YouTube would not monetize specific

239
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,350
creators especially gamers so he created

240
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,540
this terrible relationship when networks

241
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,240
where they essentially just took your

242
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,999
money and you had no leverage to go

243
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,949
against it it was that or nothing if

244
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:52,620
there's one message from all this is

245
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:54,600
don't sign anything unless you know

246
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,689
where you getting yours hundred percent

247
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,730
into too many people just read a

248
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:01,170
contract with their parents and they

249
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,750
sign aremy like oh we think we

250
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,000
understand get a lawyer to look after it

251
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:09,059
I don't care how small of a youtuber you

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,220
are don't sign anything unless you're

253
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,089
100% sure that you know what you're

254
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,829
getting into

255
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:16,350
there's too many people still make this

256
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:18,180
mistake don't do it don't do it it's

257
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,550
harder to get out of a contract than it

258
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,769
is to get in one I've dealt with the

259
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,920
similar situations I understand TPU in a

260
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:28,259
sense but it also feels very fishy in

261
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,620
the whole situation but it remains to

262
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,910
see what he has to say we don't know

263
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,029
what's been happening behind closed

264
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,730
doors could be more juice little more

265
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:41,850
tea perhaps

266
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:44,579
what's up it's me am from the future tea

267
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,589
few has them now posted a response so

268
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,740
obviously we have to get through it

269
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,449
let's watch yo what is up guys I'm gonna

270
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,160
keep this via really short all the stuff

271
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,350
about the gambling the stunts the

272
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,939
drinking I told my lawyer I did not want

273
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,040
that in there and he will do exactly

274
00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:02,429
just that he will take it out so that is

275
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,180
it no worries no worries guys if he

276
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:06,210
didn't want that in

277
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,670
I shouldn't have been in there okay your

278
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,890
lawyer represents you tea whew hey

279
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,210
there's no way he put that in there

280
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,620
without your consent

281
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,450
everyone have said anybody I never want

282
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,190
to bring that stuff in I never wanted to

283
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,470
get anybody to get emotional because

284
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,720
this isn't about that this is about me

285
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,900
in this contract this contract that I

286
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,730
signed when I didn't know any better I'm

287
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,540
an idiot I should have never signed it

288
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,880
in the first place

289
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,960
what is in this contract is so bizarre I

290
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,480
wish you guys could see this thing

291
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,830
because I can't even fathom it yeah what

292
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,420
is in this contract is insane and that's

293
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,790
not even the worst parts and what I'm

294
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,070
trying to do here is just serve justice

295
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,840
to the eSports community the eSports

296
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,220
industry these kids are getting ripped

297
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,590
off they're getting taken advantage of

298
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,290
and I'm the first person to stand up and

299
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:52,020
say this is not right this is not cool

300
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,350
and if only you guys could see what is

301
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,530
in this contract release the contract

302
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,680

hashtag relieves the contract is out

305
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,860
everyone this response in my opinion not

306
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,840
good okay it's sort of acts as if in

307
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,750
good favor that we have to take his word

308
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,430
for that the contract is so bad when

309
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,260
people are already on the fence now I

310
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,480
personally don't doubt that it is bad

311
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,680
I'm just saying if I had people

312
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,050
breathing down my neck

313
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,300
I wouldn't go trust me guys it's really

314
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,550
bad and now banks is gonna release an

315
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,550
hour video responding to this if I was

316
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:32,040
teef you I would say I know all that I

317
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:34,950
know all the points about drinking and

318
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,150
about doing the Sun it was stupid and I

319
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,740
should never have brought it up but I

320
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,510
should be a testimony to just how

321
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,060
desperate I am to get out of this

322
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,790
contract even though face hasn't taken

323
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,550
collected as they say any money from me

324
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,590
now there's nothing legally in this

325
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,660
contract to stop them from doing so all

326
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,180
this hard work and effort that I spent

327
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,980
over the past couple years I don't know

328
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,290
how long he's been famous it could just

329
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,110
be completely stripped away because of

330
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:03,030
this it's not right and yes I was an

331
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,100
idiot for signing this but this type of

332
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,500
good deals should not exist to begin

333
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,210
with and they will continue to happen

334
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,740
unless unless someone there's something

335
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,940
about him I mean he did kind of

336
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,520
formulate it in that sense

337
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,050
I never meant to make this a personal I

338
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,100
never meant this to hurt anyone's

339
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,130
feelings

340
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,070
but my livelihood is at stake here and I

341
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,340
need to fight for it I'm sorry to banks

342
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,860
for hurting his feelings he's like a

343
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:34,440
brother to me and I'm appreciative of

344
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:36,660
everything he's done but I need to ask

345
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,340
for one thing and that is for them to

346
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,170
release me from this contract if they

347
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,870
actually care about me the way they say

348
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,340
I think that's the least I can do it's

349
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,260
not right and it's not fair and I'm

350
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,940
willing to drop everything if that just

351
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,620
goes through cuz that's his goal right

352
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,260
he just want to be out of the contract I

353
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,930
would propose some sort of in-between

354
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:58,910
settlement the thing is this lawsuit is

355
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:01,920
bigger than just a dispute between

356
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,550
releasing the contract okay the labor

357
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,350
commission has been notified in

358
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,570
California and they are now forced to

359
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,160
respond to this I don't know exactly how

360
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,260
it works if they will have to launch

361
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,760
some sort of investigation but they're

362
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,990
basically saying that talent agencies

363
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,910
are supposed to be licensed and

364
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,380
regulated by the labor commission to

365
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,210
protect young talent from being suckered

366
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,920
into contracts like this they say that

367
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,170
eSport teams have been operating as

368
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,630
unread regulated talent agencies for

369
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,910
years a direct violation of the talent

370
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,260
agency Act most of these confiscated

371
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,700
streamers are very young and are often

372
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,590
unsophisticated on the season and

373
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,850
trusting as a result these young con the

374
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,010
Creator streamers are susceptible to

375
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,260
being taken advantage of and exploited

376
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,970
often by those who are supposed to be

377
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,560
looking out for their best interests

378
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,600
unfortunately this has become an

379
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,150
industry standard they are fighting to

380
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,700
change the way these eSport groups are

381
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,860
made or are functioning if the labor

382
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,200
commission is forced to respond then

383
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,940
there could be major changes happening

384
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,920
here this is bigger than just the

385
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,540
contract people were even speculating

386
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,060
that face might have to shut down

387
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,310
because of this that's why if they could

388
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,790
just come to some sort of conclusion

389
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:11,370
I'll drop my charges you drop my your

390
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,620
contract I don't know like apparently t

391
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,020
fuse lawyers some sort of Big Shot he's

392
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,580
recognized a silenced California super

393
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,490
lawyer for 12 years

394
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,920
if this gets dirty right if this gets

395
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,230
ugly teef you could be completely

396
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,360
screwed and the same way with face that

397
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,779
the stakes are very very high here all

398
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,810
right

399
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:33,480
sit for next more ham next ham in an old

400
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,519
story that basically Tati may not have

401
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,839
monetize her video but she's sure

402
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,600
monetized mine

403
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,939
patty apparently claimed Ethan from a

404
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,639
tree's video this is so sad

405
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:47,100
Tati also gave out a copyright strike to

406
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,370
another que channel that criticized her

407
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,740
and it was all looking very very fishy

408
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,819
luckily she's removed the claims and

409
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,889
apologized and it seems that they were

410
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:58,709
made an error but why are people doing

411
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:01,139
this automated claims to begin with stop

412
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:03,420
your stop apparently she has people

413
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:06,709
using footage of her without permission

414
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,689
and that's why she activated this system

415
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:12,660
the YouTube system is already so goddamn

416
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:16,110
broken and just don't use it don't use

417
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,209
auto claims never use it also to free

418
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,100
star bonded to the James Charles drama

419
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:21,899
and it seemed like that was the end of

420
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,939
the drama it's the dumbest video I've

421
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,949
probably seen in a very very long time

422
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:29,040
just basically goes oh I've been in a

423
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:31,430
dork please I accused James Charles are

424
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,930
being a sexual predator with no evidence

425
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,189
but you know I'm better than that so I'm

426
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,170
not gonna address any of the evidence

427
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:39,300
for it because I'm better than that and

428
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,420
now I'm just like dark place we're all

429
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,610
in a dark place and I was in a very dark

430
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,819
place where is his place they're going

431
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,699
to the range but it seemed at least that

432
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:53,459
it's finally solidified the end of the

433
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:58,050
Totti James and Geoffrey drama saga

434
00:16:53,459 --> 00:17:00,660
thank God mixed news Holly responds

435
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:03,140
that's right what keemstar called the

436
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,089
side hoe of the whole pro Jarrod

437
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,890
cheating situation finally came out and

438
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,679
made a response she made a very long

439
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,319
threat on Twitter she called out pro

440
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,750
Jarrod for making bad decisions about

441
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:19,169
exchanging nudes with fans she says that

442
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,149
she she has seen relevant receipts which

443
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:23,730
prove that pro Jarrod confirmed the

444
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:25,169
consent in ages of those individuals he

445
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,649
interacted with for those who don't know

446
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:31,649
she also says that people that posted

447
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:34,380
his nudes without consent it's called

448
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:37,289
revenge porn and is a felony in 48

449
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,809
states as foolish as I think it is to

450
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:43,470
exchange nudes with fans

451
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:46,610
and how bizarre that is and how much I

452
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:50,309
have disdained for that sort of thing

453
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:52,039
leaking these nudes is kind of up the

454
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,450
leg

455
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:56,639
it's interesting how no one brings up

456
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,610
that ethical aspect of it she calls out

457
00:17:56,639 --> 00:18:01,440
Heidi Pro Jared's ex-wife for being

458
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,919
abusive and having an abusive

459
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,960
relationship and she posted tweet

460
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,090
screenshots of that and sort of

461
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,370
threatening how embarrassing and how bad

462
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,649
it would be for you Pro Jared if this

463
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,259
all came out to light what she's

464
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:19,230
referring to exactly I don't know also

465
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:22,080
posting text messages about how she lied

466
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,299
about not being poly and approving of

467
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,059
the nudes now I'm not supposed to give

468
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,740
my opinion but seeing all these texts

469
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,110
and reading through this thread Heidi

470
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:35,129
seems to me like a very aggressive

471
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:38,129
resentful and mean-spirited person if

472
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:41,960
she got cheated on I do feel for her but

473
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:44,669
it doesn't seem like it was the case I

474
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,399
love how Holly posts like a lot of

475
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:49,529
evidence and improves in the text and

476
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:51,720
everyone's just like uh I think we need

477
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,350
more proof to see like if these are real

478
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,749
texts

479
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,850
no one asked that variety everyone was

480
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:59,429
completely on board from the beginning

481
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,379
oh she said he cheated oh well he must

482
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,759
have done it then now she's defending

483
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:05,309
herself and everyone's like all this

484
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,899
sudden hmm maybe it's fake I find it

485
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,519
very very interesting it's like

486
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:10,470
everyone's already made up their mind

487
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,559
about this whole situation I think

488
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:16,289
though however I still stand by what my

489
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,570
take on it is that probably everyone

490
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,440
involved is responsible in more in one

491
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,799
way or another

492
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,470
it remains to see Pro Jared's response I

493
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,200
would not be surprised if Pro Jared

494
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:31,139
makes a video showing evidence of what

495
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,029
has happened and what is more or less

496
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:35,070
what went down

497
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:38,330
even if Heidi was cheating on and was

498
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:41,970
treated poorly I don't think this public

499
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,289
persecution was it was okay the things

500
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:47,340
that she said about Holly

501
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:49,320
this is mean and disgusting I'm curious

502
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,629
to see what's gonna happen here cuz I

503
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,890
don't think it's over yet also I feel

504
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:56,340
like I should mention I've

505
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:59,580
met Holly twice obviously I don't you

506
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:06,480
can never know truly about anyone I just

507
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:07,370
don't see her doing anything bad I can't

508
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,440
picture it

509
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:13,110
yes I've only met her twice extremely

510
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,080
briefly I just don't I don't see it I

511
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,940
just don't see it next news finally this

512
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,700
has been all over my reddit about a

513
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,800
copyright claim it's the top voted thing

514
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,480
on my reddit it says all these 3,000

515
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,610
videos got claimed even though he had

516
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,650
the music license to him yeah I've had a

517
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,310
bit of a strange situation to come on my

518
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,160
youtube channel

519
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:35,340
this guy had as an outro or intro this

520
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,670
song that he do to the artists who made

521
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,680
it got license for using so he had every

522
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,140
right according to this artist to use

523
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,450
his song then all the sudden this this

524
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,350
company started claiming every single

525
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,270
one of his videos

526
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,340
she's obviously terrifying I can't

527
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:52,500
imagine that happening to me and he he

528
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,150
just says well I had the right to use

529
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,730
these I'm gonna have to go through every

530
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,440
single one of these the whole system is

531
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,570
just completely broken and I agree

532
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,600
that's ridiculous now the unfortunate

533
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:07,110
event of this is that even though he had

534
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,840
permission some samples in that song

535
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:13,800
that artist I gave him permission didn't

536
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,630
have permission to use so ridiculous but

537
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,390
that's the reality of copyright laws

538
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,850
YouTube I know I I did see that YouTube

539
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,680
was in touch with this guy hopefully

540
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,390
they'll get it sorted out if it does and

541
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,280
I'll be sure to report on it most likely

542
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,770
what YouTube can do is edit these videos

543
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,780
and edit out the outro and then resubmit

544
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,330
a claim and hopefully they'll get

545
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:36,270
released that's at least what I think is

546
