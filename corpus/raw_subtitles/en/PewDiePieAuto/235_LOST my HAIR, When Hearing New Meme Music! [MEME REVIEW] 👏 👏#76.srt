expectations are set

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,360

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,200
through what the memes are

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,600
as part of culture as part of

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,320
understanding the world

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,360

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,560
good meme

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,520

221
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,440
memes great am i right

222
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,120
next we have a new bernie sanders meme

223
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,760
because someone took a photo

224
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,560
of bernie sanders when he was not aware

225
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
and it says

226
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,560
it's this guy i don't know if he's the

227
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,959
one that took the photo chris carr

228
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,480
first class flight and first aboard

229
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,279
socialism has been good

230
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,959
to bernie sanders who is this in right

231
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,880
that took a photo bernie

232
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,240
i'm not a bernie supporter necessarily i

233
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,480
don't even know what he wants

234
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,920
this is a non-political show but why

235
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,760
would you take a photo with someone just

236
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,680
to write them out let the man fly

237
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,120
in first class he looks like he's at

238
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,120
least 200 years old

239
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,640
he looks older than the world's oldest

240
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,399
guy did you guys see that recently

241
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,680
this is turning into pew news this blew

242
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,399
my mind so this guy

243
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,120
took the price right and 112. and then

244
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,360
recently

245
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,240
four days ago this guy took the record

246
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,680
he doesn't even look old

247
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,000
jewish duty i'm telling you and

248
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,959
we children were brought down from the

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
attic

250
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,399
and put under the dining room table look

251
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
at him

252
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,240
he looks less old than bernie sanders

253
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,720
does how is that possible

254
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,760
you chris carr all right let the man fly

255
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,279
first class

256
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,200
second of all you notice how he's

257
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,000
coughing on a flight is that a little

258
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,760
suspicious

259
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,120
i think it's a little suspicious now i'm

260
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,880
not going to say what i think it is

261
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,040
because the video will go

262
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,640
clearly but i think we all know what's

263
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,000
going to happen to bernie sanders yeah i

264
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,279
wonder what kind of zombie bernie

265
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,959
sanders would turn into

266
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,120
me hitting my feet from the

267
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,560
now a lot of people added theories okay

268
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,480
what's he listening to

269
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,600
space mountain by mikhail

270
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,880
me trying to hit my jewel secretly nah

271
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,120
of course he's listening to

272
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,480
three-way the golden rule obviously he's

273
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,480
listening lasagna

274
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,240
come on we all know it all right bernie

275
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,200
meme gets the two i don't know i just

276
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,440
wanted to bring it up

277
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,800
i think it's important next meme we got

278
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,279
two more alright gamers

279
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,279

280
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,720
this one is important okay so here we

281
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,959
have in spanish

282
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,839
the suffix ito means little like poquito

283
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:30,720
right all right capicho que pasa et oms

284
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:34,240
understand the word dorito

285
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,360
means something like little doro

286
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,600
implying the existence here

287
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,720
the existence of a bigger and legendary

288
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,880
snack called

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,240
doro a huge doro dokunideska

290
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,240

292
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,839

294
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,839
