00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:09,840
been waiting for of this chair oh that's

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,830
right I'm gonna draw from my own mind I

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,770
know better than that bro whatever

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,720
waiting for her but this started off

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,619
with the live stream I I tried to draw

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,529
Sonny I try to dress sonic from my

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,660
memory it wasn't the best okay but at

9
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,609
least I tried so I want to try and do

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,890
that again and draw these cartoon

11
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,930
characters that exist in my mind but

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,110
when you put them down on paper it is

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,960
surprisingly hard okay it's a lot harder

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:45,180
than it looks so don't judge me here we

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,670
freakin go ah Pikachu a classic let's go

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,510

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,930

child so maybe this won't be too bad cuz

108
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:33,189

let's look at the result oh my god

119
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,499
I forgot to draw the mustache it was

120
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:22,689
supposed I was supposed to draw Mario

121
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:30,459
without a mustache and I just forgot to

122
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:32,379
draw I know technically like it was

123
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:35,259
supposed to be without a mustache but I

124
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:40,360
kind of want to see how if it salvages

125
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:43,539
anything yes yes that's Super Mario

126
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,639
right freaking there heck yeah you're

127
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:50,800
welcome guys Sonic's live-action design

128
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:53,019
release yesterday the new Sonic trailer

129
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,170
surely I can't make it look any worse

130
00:08:53,019 --> 00:09:04,149
than it was in that trailer so let's

131
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:06,250
just freakin do this I think what

132
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:08,529
freaked everyone out was the fact that

133
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,319
he had human teeth at least that's what

134
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:16,350
I was bothered by this is something

135
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:16,350
uneasy about having human teeth

136
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:28,629
why does it look so creepy I'm trying

137
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:31,569
I'm scaring myself this happen I'm

138
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:34,540
trying to draw it what can't I draw

139
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:36,370
solid egg I don't understand if you're

140
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,970
judging me right now you should try

141
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:42,040
drawing anything from memory it's really

142
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:49,110
hard especially these very specific

143
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:49,110
designs this badly how is this possible

144
00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:01,389
God forgive me what did I get right

145
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:04,149
nothing

146
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:07,269
yes years I didn't remember eight years

147
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:10,360
I got the mouth pretty well to be honest

148
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:13,269
Sega team if you need help just hit me

149
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,040
up I got you you know you got some harsh

150
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:18,189
critics but clearly people don't

151
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,740
understand how hard it is to draw a

152
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:22,990
perfect Sonic I'll do one more one more

153
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:27,069
because I feel disgusting

154
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:29,889
okay here we have shrink drawing Shrek

155
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:32,350
from memory I feel like this should be

156
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:34,959
if there's one thing that I should be

157
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:38,170
able to draw from my own memory it's

158
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,139
it's gotta be strict because I have not

159
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,449
looked on a man with any more detail

160
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:46,750
than I have ever looked at Shrek

161
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:51,339
I know his ins and outs impeccably as

162
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:54,160
you can see I am already doing amazing

163
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:56,920
it's got a very round face now the

164
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,639
question is what is on that face well

165
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:05,050
he's got a big smile no he's got a got a

166
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:07,600
big smile right okay okay all right

167
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,180
notes I'm just gonna guess that it's a

168
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,649
big nose I don't really remember this is

169
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:16,870
like a really cute but this is so cute

170
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,720
oh my God he's adorable

171
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,629
has anyone drawn Shrek this cute I don't

172
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,670
think so buddy he's got these weird

173
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:28,220
patches on his head too right oh no

174
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:31,040
we're entering uncanny valley again No

175
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:41,540

176
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:44,000
he's so chunky oh oh no no no I'm just

177
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:47,000

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,890
for your wonderful suggestions okay

180
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,770
honestly though was I too far off on the

181
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,660
Shrek like let's skip the torso bit but

182
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,060
I think that's pretty close I think

183
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,480
that's pretty good thank you

184
