38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,640
way of multi-layer marketing where

39
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,320
brands just make it their product the

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,320

and finally meme of the decade Vox the

250
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,970
pinnacle of journalism what is their

251
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,410
idea of meme of the decade where they

252
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,980
brought up double rainbow that was a

253
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,380
good meme right double rainbow yeah sure

254
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,600
don't even put that on the list alright

255
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,540
meme of the decade has to be something

256
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,120
that will go on beyond the decade right

257
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,880

258
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,640

dumbasses dodge no one uses charge not

262
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:01,230
even ironically Slenderman no one hey I

263
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,300
get it these are popular memes in their

264
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,560
self in their own little encapsulation

265
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:10,740
but they are not I repeat not worthy

266
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,920
what the [ __ ] is this on fleek didn't

267
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,310
die look they even can bring up baby Oda

268
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,160
an ironic Lee baby Oda a meme that's

269
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:22,319
lasted what three weeks meme of decade

270
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,149
potentialize I think this has meme of

271
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:26,339
decade potential I don't know about you

272
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:28,440
guys but I think baby Oda has a lot of

273
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,510
potential to transpire and like last for

274
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,370
another decade I think so

275
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,769
but when I first saw these memes is

276
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,630
talking about when Normie say baby Yoda

277
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:38,430
should be meme of decades sounds like

278
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,170
it's not is anyone actually saying that

279
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,380
and I was like oh god people actually

280
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,920
are oh this is ridden by the dumb ass

281
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:49,740
if that wrote an article of me hahaha oh

282
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,430
my god the dumb curry how do you get so

283
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,530
stupid

284
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,750
this is Pepe the Frog yep easily one of

285
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,610
the most iconic memes and of the decade

286
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,120
and has remained relevant ever since

287
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,070
uh-huh

288
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,750
so he should be meme of the decade makes

289
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:06,270
sense to me so vote for Pepe baby Yoda

290
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:09,060
Yoda my votes for baby Yoda I think baby

291
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:11,100
Yoda another fair argument is for the

292
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,570
earth to pay respect when everyone is

293
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,310
voting for me with a decade or meme of

294
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,590
the year but you made your way into

295
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,990
people's language I think that's a

296
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,120
pretty fair point right that's what me

297
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,210
mother Dec it should be something that

298
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,820
will go on and live on and forever and

299
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,470
it will prosper and live greatness but

300
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,810
it seems like doggy wins though I don't

301
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,590
