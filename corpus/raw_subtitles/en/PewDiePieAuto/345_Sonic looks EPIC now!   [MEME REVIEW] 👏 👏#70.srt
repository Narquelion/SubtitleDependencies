00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:19,320
internet legit I was actually impressed

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,270
when I saw the trailer I'm like oh

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,270
actually Sonic looks really good now

27
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:31,690
oh now you look at frame by frame look

28
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,490
at what a difference all the expressions

29
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,130
and everything I don't even care about

30
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,870
this fell but I'm just impressed what is

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,090
that it's just some little dweeb look at

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,650
the lion left wood look at the reaction

33
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,930
difference - what did so much more

34
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:50,020
interesting I can't believe they went

35
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:53,050
with this oh I cannot believe they

36
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,660
created that originally it's now you

37
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,000
truly see how bad it is but man I'm I

38
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,700
gotta give credit like they really fixed

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,040
it up there they also changed robotic to

40
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,960
red because that makes sense yeah it

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,750

00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,900
complaining and it worked

50
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,900
good job Internet you truly change lives

congratulations well done everyone that

53
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,340
complain about Sonic

54
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,920
you deserve a pat on the back you made

55
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,900
life a little less miserable internet

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,390
new sonic design that doesn't look like

57
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,950
a monster yes new Sonic design that

58
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,310
doesn't look like my sleep paralysis

59
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,650
demon that misses me at 3:00 a.m. when I

60
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,180
go up and try and get pickles the fact

61
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,470
they changed it and listened to people

62
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,660
is the reason I'm going to see the movie

63
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,910
good job let's get real we all would

64
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,070
have seen it anyway so now of course

65
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,170
everyone has to love this film it has to

66
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,120
get 10 out of 10 score even though the

67
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,640
plot isn't as good the voice acting is

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,160
still pretty questionable but it's worth

69
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:16,000
mentioning regardless sonic meme gets a

70
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:18,239
Redemption ball of blue it's a fine next

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,239
me

72
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,940
logan paul loss say it with me Logan

73
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:27,560
Paul lost I didn't fall of this second

74
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,030
follow-up fight I just I thought the

75
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,040
first one was enough but there's some

76
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,630
funny memes that came afterwards which I

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,100
really really appreciate there were so

78
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,690
many memes on the first fight but the

79
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,400
second fight I don't know it but there

80
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,050
aren't no memes I won't be there that's

81
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,160
the tie with it when you actually know

82
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,780
the answer for once but the teacher

83
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,780
calls on someone else

84
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:59,130
Dogen no no apparently was a split

85
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,910
choice with the the points again it was

86
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,040
really close

87
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:08,160
so I mean fair enough motive Polar's

88
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:10,200
after the fight this is so sad those

89
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,870
poor Logan Polar's can't believe they

90
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,209
lost but the real hero out of this whole

91
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,729
outcome it's the man that illegally

92
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,350
stream Logan poles versus ksi fight

93
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:21,830
through lemon ke viewers of the

94
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,870
reflection of his glasses

95
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:26,580
don't move bruh I think one of the

96
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,710
funniest things is Logan Falls reaction

97
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,150
to why he lost it's so good

98
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,880
Logan paula's explain why he lost the

99
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,650
fight hear my voice I'm sick I woke up

companies all around the globe love it

136
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,740
apparently that's the game you're just

137
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,860
walking through to deliver packages

138
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,480
amazing wow that's so cool I'm so glad I

139
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,760
got deaf straining so I can take a break

140
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,030
from real life tasks to deliver cargo

141
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,560
and take care of baby but nothing is

142
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,750
says satisfying and when you make that

143
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,990
delivery take it from Tobey Maguire

144
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,000
Pizza time

145
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,940
just feels good when completing a task

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,610
no matter how monotonous and boring and

147
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,880

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,710
of game that isn't very eventful there's

175
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,090
a lot of dead gaps and walking and

176
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,610

boring I know you guys play now alright
