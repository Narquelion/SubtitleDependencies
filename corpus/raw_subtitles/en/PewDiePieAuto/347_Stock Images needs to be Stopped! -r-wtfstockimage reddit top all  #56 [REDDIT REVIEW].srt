would you need a stock image of that

that is my question

123
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,900
I wonder if stock imagery it's like a

124
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,870
lucrative business or not because it

125
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,030
seems so easy to do maybe that's naive

126
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,700
for me to say but I don't know like edit

it is an issue we're just working on it

196
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,550
why would you need this I feel like if

197
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,990
you're gonna make sock imagery at least

198
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,520

199
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm running a business what do I want

200
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,270

201
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,310
running a business I would want the

202
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,250
girls eating salad like when would you

203
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,380

204
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,720
the message and I get what you're saying

205
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,260
but like why would anyone buy their head

206
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,580
it's so specific that's what I mean with

207
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,240
look at they like can't you just make

208
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,160
stock imagery that are actually

209
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,470
useful its stock images like those

210
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,480
mobile phone game ads that are just like

211
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,010
weird an obscure to draw attention and

212
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,399
it actually works like I don't

213
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,380
understand it it's so confusing lemon

214
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,220
with tongue and disembodied Robert

215
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:06,060
rubber glove okay but Wow

216
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,580
but wow it looks it long Furby that

217
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,800
March they wanted to make I thought I

218
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,779
could justify my sudden need of owning a

219
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,820
long Furby by creating one for a video I

220
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,440
was denied I guess me and my sty should

221
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:26,130
make one cuz I never heard back from

222
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:28,470
Willie and Osmond why somebody remade

223
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,690
this remember the cake pillow case what

224
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,589
happened when I sent it to my cousin oh

225
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,930
it's not up yet wait okay do we have

226
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:38,430
answers we have answers for once there's

227
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,010
a background behind the stock image

228
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,500
Getty Images in 2007 I worked with a

229
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:48,540
photographer to document a concept piece

230
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:50,760
of a man me sleeping on a sheet cake it

231
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,440
was a simple visual pun a cake that

232
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,589
looked like a pillow and there's obvious

233
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,630
play on sweet dreams there was no intent

234
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,089
other than creating ambiguous benign

235
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,459
image that we did and releasing it to

236
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:04,649
the world few years later images from

237
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:07,440
the shoot were sold to get images as

238
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,740
stock photos then in 2011 one of those

239
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,540
photos appeared as number 13 on the

240
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,579
BuzzFeed list okay 60 completely

241
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,350
unusable stock photos see that's the

242
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:18,149
thing they're all unusable right now

243
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,310
claimed by online culture as a proper

244
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,690
mean the image constantly reappears I

245
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,050
never seen it before

246
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:28,170
oh god these are even better you're

247
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,870
proud of something and no one cares this

248
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:33,089
is so sad how is BuzzFeed still a thing

249
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,890
Jesus Lord why did this just suck out

250
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:38,130
all the fun from it knowing that

251
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:42,810
BuzzFeed made a version of it yeah oh my
