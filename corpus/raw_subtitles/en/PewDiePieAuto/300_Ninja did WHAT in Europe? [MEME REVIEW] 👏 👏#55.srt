18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,560
lens I don't understand why it's blurry

19
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:11,890
probably because a woman did the photo

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,750

21
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,149

00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:29,840
but why don't they just focus on it the

48
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,360
photo of the black hole is blurry but if

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,760
