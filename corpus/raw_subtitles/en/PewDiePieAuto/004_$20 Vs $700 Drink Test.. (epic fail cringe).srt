73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,360
to do this and you saw how confident

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,560
that was right too

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,560
yeah you can't tell a difference

76
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,239
big brain big tongue i do have a big

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,239
tongue

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,319
all right next we do the coke

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,519
i don't know i'm gonna make that mistake

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,959
all right

81
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,360
do you think i cheated is that what you

82
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,799
think yeah i don't need to cheat

83
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,560
oh you forgot one of the coke so we have

84
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,239
curiosity cola it's about 1.6 pounds

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
and then we have a diet and a regular

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,599
coke which is i think it's both a pound

87
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,480
so is it worth paying the extra

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,480
65 so we should start between the coke

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,680
and the curiosity coke i think

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,640
and then we get into the sugar-free ones

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,680
they are close i'm confident i will nail

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,480
everything

93
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,799

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
the reason i wanted to do this video

129
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,720
because me and marcia were having

130
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,240
regular coke and diet coke no it was

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
coke zero in diet coke

132

136
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,479
will be worth it

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,360
okay i feel like we're doing important

138
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,520

143
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,479

do that no no no no

150
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,400
no no what we learned so far it's

151
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
actually worth paying the extra money

152
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,120
for

153
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,440

172
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,560
like this weird

one i'll try and find the coke first

176
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,680

180
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,720
between coke zero

okay tell you what this tastes better it

185
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,919
has a little drier aftertaste

186
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,759
it does i'm usually bad at describing

187
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,039
flavors but it's all coming to me

188
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,879
today it's got a more richness to it

189
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:12,879
i'm inclined to think that this is the

190
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:15,440
diet coke and this is the zero

191
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,440
yes

192
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,360
i mean i knew of course of course never

193
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,599
doubt me for a second

194
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,800
what did i say well this tastes better

195
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
right it's weird because i

196
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,720
i always buy coke zero because i'm like

197
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,840
it's manlier right that's their whole

198
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,520
marketing they try and

199
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,599
market it for guys but i actually do

200
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,080
prefer the flavor of diet coke

201
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,719
so like don't be fooled by marketing

202
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,640
guys

203
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,800
this is marketing this is you plebs

204
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,360
buying into it and here's me ascended

205
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,800
ascended from all flavors you just said

206
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,000
you also get the

207
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,120
manly one even though you liked it

208
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,320
so you were not no no no no

209
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,519
no what i meant was

210
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,760
even though i am aware of it i i still

211
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,519
play into it i i play into their little

212
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,040
game it's like when a child wants to

213
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,040
play with mar you're not listening to me

214
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,320
regular coke is better yeah but it's a

215
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,080
lot of sugar and it's really unhealthy

216
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,640
but diet coke is still unhealthy yeah i

217
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,030
know

218
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,240
i know drink water gamers

219
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:23,839
[Music]

220
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,839
yeah ask your questions did i say that

221
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,440
all right so we basically have a friend

222
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,760
bought this

223
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,600
he brought it over as a as a gift so i

224
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,320
assumed oh that's an expensive beer that

225
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,279
they got me

226
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,320
no it isn't i am on to you mother you

227
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
give me cheap beer

228
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,080
you come to my house and give me cheap

229
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,959
beers uh and we got call spread

230
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,600
the caulsberg is uh i think it's danish

231
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,160
yeah

232
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,600
which is disappointing but i'll drink it

233
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,560
this doesn't really make sense

234
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,600
i i can guarantee you i will know these

235
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,160
the cold sprig is up

236
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,240
roughly a pound and the other the other

237
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,519
one is 1.2 pounds

238
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,519
so there's no difference

239
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,959
negligible negligible difference yeah

240
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,519
neglable magical bro how do you say

241
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,399
ninja ball

242
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,399
neglige negligible

243
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,760
negligible

244
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,839
they're closed i can hear the phone

245
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,279
that's a sign that it's a beer i guess

246
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,560
okay they're quite similar in

247
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:40,000
uh in color actually zoom

248
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,000

niche all right bye denmark bye denmark

271
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,959

can't do anything right

273
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:38,959
congratulations now for the final

274
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,920
test this is the biggest price

275
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,519
difference

276
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,160
by far i can't even find the price of

277
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,519
this

278
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,399
but it's 23 years which probably means

279
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,680
it ranges

280
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,399
between 300 to 400 pounds

281
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,639
i could be wrong it's probably honestly

282
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,440
even more because i i

283
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,320
can't even find it online a company sent

284
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,760

327
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,519
23 years will be very dark and it will

328
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,920
be

329
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,760
very rich in flavor it's not always

330
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,440
better to have more aged it's just what

331
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
you prefer but if you are a whiskey

332
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
drinker you will definitely prefer a

333
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,959
more rich

334
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,040
taste can i look might say zoom in

335
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,199

336
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,519
very similar oh no

337
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,199

the jameson

342
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,880
because the jameson doesn't smell

343
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,880
anything

344
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,480

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,880
it smells sweet and not

350
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,160
some alcohols will just hit your nose

351
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,279
and it's like oh

352
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,120

353
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,800
a really nice candle

354
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,279
but it's the smell of pure man

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,079
your face is that did you did you smell

356
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,079
just the alcohol

357
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,040
with the smell my sister made the

358
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,040
weirdest face

359
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,360
i mean to me it doesn't smell like

360
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,839
anything really

361
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,199
yeah i can't really touch it's weird my

362
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,160
nose is a big plug though

363
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,720
okay well i passed the first test right

364
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,839
yeah

365
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,519
okay i guess i wanted to mix them up and

366
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,120
see if i can just go pure

367
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,040
flavor right because obviously it smells

368
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,040
better but i will

369
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,560
i'll clog my nose all right and then

370
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,199
i'll close my eyes as well

371
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,199
start with this

372
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,000
jameson oh god

373
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,450

gotta be jameson that's gotta be amazing

375
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,109
[Music]

yeah that's the bushido much richer

377
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,000
flavor

378
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,759
the aftertaste hits way more as well

379
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,440
first when they hit your tongue it's not

380
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,920
that much difference

381
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,880
but the flavor develops differently did

382
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
i get it right

383
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,759
no did i got it wrong no [ __ ] way i

384
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,680
went on this whole [ __ ] preach

385
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,040
are you serious i didn't mean that i

386
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,120
just seemed like these and then i that

387
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,040
was checked but these had more

388
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,040
are you sure yeah this is the jameson

389
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:09,839
are you kidding me 20 pound whiskey

390
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,880
are you serious

391
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,480
what this is so embarrassing look my

392
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,480
face is getting all red

393
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,480
well i guess i prefer cheap whiskey i

394
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,040
actually don't like the makoto that much

395
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,440
then

396
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,120
sorry makoto i'm lost for words i don't

397
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,240
know what to say

398
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,160
it does smell way nicer but the flavors

399
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,839
the jameson's flavor develops in your

400
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,759
mouth which is really weird

401
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,880
i wish i had more whiskey to try like

402
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,639
actually try

403
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,920
uh because i never had my culture before

404
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,880
well anything

405
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,680
can happen here on the pewdiepie channel

406
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,720
clearly i'm a fraud

407
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,720
but yeah i guess that makes it

408
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,000
interesting there you go out of

409
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,480
diet coke water and beer

410
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,360
it's clear that paying that little extra

411
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,360
is worth it

412
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,399
but whiskey 600 600

413
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,759
difference guess that's how it is

414
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,679
i hope you enjoyed me embarrassing

415
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,839
myself in front of millions of audience

416
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,199
but uh that's it i guess this is a good

417
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
thing for me that i don't drink whiskey

418
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,000
anymore so

419
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,520

424
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,080

425
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,080
