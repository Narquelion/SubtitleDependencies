all the time how did I forget about

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,230
Hawaii

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,449
I forgot Lawai my favorite show

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,340
YouTube's favorite show I forgot to fail

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,939
me now there's gonna be a bunch of

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,039
outdated means what the Frick top I

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,410
always go top and then past week but

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,950
it's been over a frickin week let's

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,420
freaking go gamers

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,399
why would someone named their little

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:45,930
girl Ilan s mhm

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:49,829
Ilan met a nine year old Henry that's

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,010
amazing how many times are we gonna post

16
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:57,930
days look how much taller I am the Joe

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,930
Joey Joey says he's 181 okay then how

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:08,189
tall am I then excuse me if Joe is 181

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:10,890
that means I'm 262 at least so I think

20
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,070
this proves lunch overall that I even

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,710
though I have giant shoes I'm still

22
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,240
extremely tall I am a giant the Swedish

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,130
giant they used to call me back in

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,590
school I never said this no

25
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,619
microtransactions no loot boxes and no

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,200
he won't be adding them a single-player

27
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,810
Star Wars story for those of you who are

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,880
ready to become a Jedi it was based in

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,820
several too simply I feel bad when you

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,520
watch the conference's of the people

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,200
that do actual the actual developers

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,960
who's worked on the game and they seem

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,450
so passionate and so involved that they

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,310
it is an actual good game and I think

35
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,860
for them to put all this effort to be

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,930
ruined by almost you could say politics

37
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,549
around microtransactions whether you

38
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,409
like them or hate them people obviously

39
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,299
like that that's why they buy them

40
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,159
it's a shame so I'm glad I'm glad that

41
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,950
finally there's none of it you know you

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,130
can argue either Felix camera Martius

43
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,270
camera there's amazing scientific

44
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,090
achievements of course it's gonna be

45
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,170
reduced to [ __ ] low tier PvP memes oh

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,170
look there's more on them

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,490
something made the frickin HD doubt

48
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,720
that's so mean this is hate speech of

49
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,120
any kind huh

50
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,290
pity pie at home PewDiePie in Japan

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,600
alright guys I'm trying to figure out

52
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,600
the camera alright I understand now what

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,760
I think the message has been going

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,310
getting through when you realize that

55
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,800
the picture of the black hole shows what

56
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,130
the black hole looked like 55 million

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,280
years ago is it 55 million light years

58
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,260
away without how that works

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,760
how does space and time works my cold is

60
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,130
really one of those concepts that

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,540
obviously this is not around black hole

62
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,670
but it's one of those concept that it

63
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,420
hasn't really been explored in in sci-fi

64
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:05,020
even though they are so crazy to think

65
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,490
about I think I read something from

66
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,400
Stephen Hawking what that was like if

67
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,990
you go near a black hole regret the

68
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,550
gravity is so strong that he will

69
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,290
stretch your whole body out like

70
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,570
spaghetti I want to become gravity

71
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,540
spaghetti sounds awesome

72
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:23,020
pity pie is a white male Hitler is also

73
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,970
white male coincidence I think not this

74
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,650
format has been with the comments have

75
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,420
been on every single one of my videos

76
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,670
Petey pine laughs he's making fun of

77
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,490

original clip is when the dog sneezes

86
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:58,030
okay so so it kind of ruins the me for

87
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,700
me knowing the context the Egyptians

88
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,730
were truly more advanced than this you

89
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,620
know feast a stone brofist this is

90
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:09,160
actually you guys have figured out huh

91
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,140
this is a I'm actually made this 2,000

92
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,560
years ago is that what the Egyptians

93
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:18,520
leave so that now in present-day we can

94
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,180
have a stone fist 400 mil that would be

95
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,490
epic a bit of a hypocrite

96
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,010
against Peter Piper racist joke it's on

97
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,610
a show that uses racism and racism and

98
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:34,699
sexism as germs oh my god checkmate Wil

99
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:37,430
Wheaton blood I bet we written doesn't

100
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,590
have a G fuel sponsorship so joke's on

101
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,590
you will Whedon it's kind of sad how

102
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,570
things people turn out because I don't

103
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,940
think we'll Whedon is a bad person I

104
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,040
hear me out this is just purely

105
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,750
speculation and I have no idea if this

106
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,660
is true but I think a lot of people just

107
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,479
struggle with themselves and they kind

108
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,510
of project that onto other people

109
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,850
and they project people to be worse than

110
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,410
they are and kind of lift themselves up

111
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,419
I don't know where we I don't know

112
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,940
anything about him but I get that a

113
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,380
feeling from me I've watched some of his

114
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,050
shows he doesn't seem like a bad person

115
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,650
I think he's probably struggling with

116
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:18,410
some sort of mental illness and he's

117
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:22,000
just latching out onto the world and

118
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:26,479
this is making it even worse for himself

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,090
pure speculation I have no idea that's

120
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,130
true normal happy people don't act like

121
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:35,830
this that's my point

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:38,770
