00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,880
or having the worst commercials I'm

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,310
sorry for having the greatest

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,010
commercials of all time okay

51
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,140
look a fly angel despite how these ads

52
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,820
look like believe it or not they told me

53
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,640
that they actually perform really good

54
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,220
so well played Lords mobile they were

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,320
surprisingly cool about it not only did

56
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,880
they joke about it but also the girl

57
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,310
that recorded the original video

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,660

59
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,190
was really cool I just really want to

60
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,930
emphasize it's really cool that Lords

61
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,580
mobile actually reached out to do this

62
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,870
promo with me they're awesome they

63
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,510
support me and they said that they

64
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,520
really like my content Lords mobile nine

65
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,080
year olds confirmed but they also wanted

66
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,000
to support by giving back to the nine

67
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,959
year olds so they came with an amazing

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,489
offer of fifty thousand in cash to

69
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,800
people that download and play a large

70
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:10,070
mobile you guys know me I'm all about

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,709
strategy every single time I think about

72
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,260
20 steps ahead like that I name a

73
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:17,420
character with the glasses that flare up

74
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,799
that's for me in Lords mobile and Lords

75
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,720
more ballet is considered by a lot of

76
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,150
people do I sound natural like the other

77
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,769
people doing commercial like the

78
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:31,070
ultimate strategy game brah did I just

79
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:33,680
get anther VIP - I'm good at this okay

80
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,900
so first we're gonna Scout oh he has

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,120
mixed unit I think this calls for the

82
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,370
arrow formation so I've been playing

83
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,260
this game and what's nice about it is

84
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,989
that unlike other games like fortnight

85
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,940
which takes up a ton of time you can

86
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,920
play this whenever you want wherever you

87
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,630
want and still have an amazing gaming

88
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,170
experience especially when you were this

89
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,450
good I got a call on whatsapp ignore I'm

90
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,330
gaming one of the things I like most

91
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,310
about is that you can be a no can I say

92
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,350
that sorry what I meant was you can be

93
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,700
mischievous in this game which is

94
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,299
personally the main reason I enjoy

95
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,739
playing games online you can capture

96
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,680
execute and charge the ransom for other

97
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,600
players online and if that's not a good

98
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,160
reason to play this game I don't know

99
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,500
why I think that really takes me back to

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,480

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,209
