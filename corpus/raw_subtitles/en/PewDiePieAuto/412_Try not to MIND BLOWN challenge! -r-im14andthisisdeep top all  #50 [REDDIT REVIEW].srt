and this is Dee one of my favorite

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,439
subreddits actually because that

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,119
everyone can shamefully admit that

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,960
they've been this person at least once

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,870
in their life

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,630
oh god no not the cartoons boomers

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,660
favorites question how much did it all

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,730
cost answer never forget the sacrifice

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,620
of those brave Americans who are ground

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:49,140
up and made into hotdogs I'm 14 and this

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,410
is deep really makes you think we live

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,809
in a society Mickey Mouse oh my god has

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,500
so many friend requests but the real

21
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,079
mouse has no friends what does that even

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,409
mean well if you were 14 and deep you

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,220
would understand mr. Jamal poor rats

24
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,799
can't even get followings haha gets

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:18,570
motivated by a quote upload C's

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:20,670
subreddit R I'm 14 and this is deep this

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,920
photographer removes phones from his

28
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,189
images and the results are a disturbing

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,650
reality check I too think it would be

30
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,290
different if we were staring into our

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,110
empty palms and not an incredibly

32
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,090
complex device which gives us access to

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,740
almost all the information in the world

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,270
and can be used to communicate with

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,520
other people do you think that's what

36
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,369
they're doing in this picture I'm 14 and

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,860
this is not deep enough oh my god this

38
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,820
should be the new face of this subreddit

39
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,729
Billy a leash

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:55,020
she's broken the song title is so clever

41
00:01:50,729 --> 00:02:01,920
what it probably would have taken me

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:04,890
three years fourth when he likes though

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,020
I love how the title says she's broken

44
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,489
says he's okay

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,840
what I didn't even notice that oh the

46
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,629
son must be giving me extra powers

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,640
kids getting annoying go away it's right

48
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:21,340
in my eyes why did I say to sit down for

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,970
once no matter how good the person you

50
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,450
are

51
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,489
you're evil in someone's story oh my god

52
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,890
I want to make it their joke but I am

53
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:34,540
banned from making those and that says a

54
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:37,330
lot about society I have an even smaller

55
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,700
wireless device that gives me access to

56
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:43,390
thousands of books and movies it's a

57
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,030
library card Oh God there needs to be a

58
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,459
Boomer subreddit dedicated to these

59
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,530
cartoons boomers loved cartoons more

60
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,970
than anything if you see a cartoon in

61
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,620
this style you know it's gonna be

62
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,269
something about how kids are dumb do you

63
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,640
think that your attitude towards smart

64
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:00,220
phones might be an extension of your

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,340
fears that you along with your items and

66
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,500
the leaves of yesteryear will become

67
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,079
obsolete that rather than simply

68
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,239
embracing both can change and age your

69
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:12,069
avoidance and decrying of advancing

70
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,180
technology will mask your slowly

71
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:19,630
depleting dude Oh get ready doom boomers

72
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,660

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,000
society boomer comics I kind of want to

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,970
short chain has changed a lot like how

79
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,220
well for starters singers would actually

80
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,709
stink well oh I see what did I mean

81
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,040
they're criticizing like heavy metal

82
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:52,630
what this is rapping back in my day they

83
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:56,019
would go the road the wind so other guy

84
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,120
I agree that's Liping think those are

85
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:00,160
broken web site no matter how many times

86
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:05,829
you click the pictures nothing happens

87
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:08,530
it's so cringe kids are so dumb they

88
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:11,349
don't know what the book is ah yes the

89
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,660
classic weird looked at so when printed

90
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,269
out the bunch of tweets and then they

91
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:21,039
added extra characters to all the words

92
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:23,770
all right I call it book they says all

93
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:25,870
day to be fair though I think I read

94
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,550
somewhere that statistics for reading is

95
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,639
lower it is decreasing

96
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,990
so it's like they're not wrong and it's

97
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,389
the exact same thing I said I think I

98
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,770
saw something about like Zoomers can't

99
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,259
use power tools or something knight-like

100
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,780
that millennial diets apparently have

101
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:43,120
terrible DIY skills and half of them

102
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,240

103
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,949
drill that fixed the light

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,289
apparently 50% of millennial dads don't

105
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,330
own a cordless drill that's deep that's

106
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:59,979

we have informations to do all these

120
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,199
things you could just google and figure

121
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,719
it out yourself

122
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,900
right if anything Millennials should be

123
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:45,520
more equipped to do anything than anyone

124
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,050
jumpstart a dead car Barry I've done

125
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,650

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,550
right I guess we're not moving on cuz

131
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,789
this is what the subreddit is this is

132
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,740
something that died out around 2021

133
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:09,880
because too many people were getting

134
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,979
offended by it

135
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,969
I'm starting to realize I'm a more of a

136
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:18,279
boomer okay I'm hey is he wrong oh god

137
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:21,250
I'm agreeing with this subreddit is

138
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:23,560
centering this is not epic I get that

139
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,409
it's not funny oh god I'm going through

140
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,060
a weird self-reflecting trip here and I

141
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:30,419

146
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,649
meaningfulness of your friends it

147
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:48,619
doesn't matter how many friends you have

148
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:52,379

149
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:55,319

was quirky and love skulls and had blue

161
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,749
dyed hair that would be so interesting

162
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,029
girls with blonde hair can never be

163
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:29,999

generation research find what that is

169
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,949
not the statistics I've heard

170
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:49,379
Millennials find 83% of the under 30s

171
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:55,860
read at least one book a year compared

172
00:07:49,379 --> 00:08:02,069
to 79 of their elders brah that's funny

173
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:05,550
water nine kilometer h2o 50 meters this

174
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:07,829
says society such an example this is

175
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,779
basically the equivalent of the Jimmy

176
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:13,289
Neutron sodium meme have you seen that

177
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:15,509

00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,729
chloride yes it's the same assault but

181
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:25,619
you could have just said salt instead

182
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,569
everyone in this town knows you're a boy

183
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:29,369
genius dude you don't need to say overly

184
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:32,159
large words to sound more intelligent

185
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:34,380
the batteries that nobody cares how

186
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,120
smart you are is that thing I want

187
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,889
simplistic objects by their scientific

188
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,110
name ironically makes you seem less

189
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:42,329
intelligent more pompous I know you're

190
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,880
smart enough to be better than this bra

191
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:46,709
there's an even better one of this one

192
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,260
let me see if I can mine it oh wow this

193
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:51,750
mean be popping though this is I decide

194
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,070
table salt which in addition to sodium

195
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,639
chloride contains

196
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,990
taking agents and potassium iodate I

197
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,300
don't know how to say that in English

198
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,149
which is added to prevent iodine

199
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,970
deficiency so not only are you being

200
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:08,430
overly pretentious by insisting on using

201
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,290
scientific terminology for everyday

202
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,660
items you are factually wrong

203
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:18,480
your arrogance if you're down for your

206
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:30,930
saved life important extremely deep work

207
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:38,180
smart not hard what the heck is this I

208
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:38,180

209
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:46,230

214
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,329
Dave criticizing how addicted we are to

215
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,040
social media

216
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:02,220

220
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,690
monitor fa9 monitors you are taking it

221

too far oh god I have too many modern

222
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:26,910
thoughts I will interact with society

223
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,470
man I wonder if there's actually a fair

224
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,810
point because the elder generation

225
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,730
always complains about the the younger

226
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,319
generation that's just been a thing

227
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,970
that's never gonna change but I wonder

228
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:37,829
if there's a concern that the older

229
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,319
generation has had that was actually

230
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:41,810
valid and actually did bad

231
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:45,899
I wonder what's an example of that

232
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:48,870
instapage speed 14 year old so sad when

233
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,459
I die I want my heart donated to NASA so

234
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:58,050

and he makes it to ask for pear this is

238
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:08,640
so deep if you're truly bass you would

239
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,700
understand that all apple trees are bad

240
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,130
because apples are sensational pleasures

241
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,500
that will all lead to suffering this is

242
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,510

00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,300
be able to explore the entire galaxy

367
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,490
there will still be places completely

368
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,540
away from us that was a I I just think

369
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:30,280
that's cool if swearing is immature why

370
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,140
is it referred as adult language Dave

371
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:38,020
Dave

372
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:41,380

373
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:44,440

375
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,559
that means

376
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:53,080
stinky Zoomers this is why there are no

377
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,700
Bigfoot sightings if anything this

378
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,910
should be the opposite cuz now literally

379
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,220
everyone has a camera right everyone in

380
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,870
the world carries a camera with them and

381
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,820
every single day of their life you'd

382
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,760
think if something paranormal happened

383
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:09,669
people would know about it right people

384
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,160
would have taken a photo of it by now my

385
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:13,960
friend who dropped out of college posted

386
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,990

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,490

392
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,799

393
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:36,429
with the pencils here it is actually a

394
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,450
sketch that's the worst part of this may

395
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:45,040
I have a plastic bag already inside I

396

someone who changes and improves himself

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,679
to love and protect you I don't

404
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,290

society puts on men to be a square yes

413
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,440
the age difference cats used to enjoy

414
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:35,190

goddamnit I'm getting too old to review

424
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:05,370
the subject if you didn't see my hoodie

425
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:07,230
today it says we live in a society I got

426
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:12,110
it because of the message behind it and

427
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:14,340
how dark society is to this day the

428
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:17,429
double meaning of the meme that's

429
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:20,610
beautiful again I'm on the side of the

430
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:22,710
cartoon school is just trying to make

431
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,559
you think a certain way they don't teach

432
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,720

433
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:32,519

434
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,440

439
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,440
sometimes it's fun to cheat that a

440
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:49,710
salary is the bribe they give you to

441
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,620
forget your dreams oh no one's stopping

442
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,980

443
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,960
how about that this is Christ I think

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,629
every prisoner should be able to vote

445
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:07,379

446
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:10,379

00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:23,009
thing if people actually talked about

475
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:25,169
like veganism not in a way of shaming

476
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,609
people and just saying oh actually it's

477
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:28,919
really good for the environment not to
