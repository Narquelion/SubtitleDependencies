118
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:17,330
what is this depravity each morning I

119
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,580
put one uncooked ravioli in a thermos I

120
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,950
pour hot water over it steeping it like

121
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,440
tea and then I drink it all day at work

122
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,780
I work at the White House and at the end

123
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,720
of the day as I take the last sip of the

124
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,990
tea the soft ravioli slides into my

125
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,970
mouth and I eat it now on God's earth

126
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,580
would you do that I think the fact that

127
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,620
someone gets pleasure out of it is what

128
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,530
makes it so much more sickening why

129
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,330
would you do that

130
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,550
Thanks I hate people now that's one

131
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,290
creepy pasta just the fact that he works

132
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:56,120

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:58,000

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,620
