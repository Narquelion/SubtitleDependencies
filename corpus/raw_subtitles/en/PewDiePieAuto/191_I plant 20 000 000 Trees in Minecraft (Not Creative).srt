but it means we'll get a lot of bone

152
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,240

why mr beast why could we not have found

170
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,560
better solution

171
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,120
okay okay i like it i like it i like it

172
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,960
uh we'll put an observer here and that

173
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,039
is going to

174
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,160
power as soon as it reaches here only

175
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,280
these are going to push so it's just

176
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,360
going to keep

177
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,360
20 million trees 20 million trees

178
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:41,120
yeah yeah yeah yeah 20 million trees

179
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,399
20 million trees easy easy

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,560
look at that that's a sweet sound of

181
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,560
bones being crushed god damn it

182
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,080
i just realized observer will activate

183
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,120
itself

184
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,120
once it reaches here

185
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,560
will it

186
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,080
damn it is um the most overly

187
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,080
complicated thing

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,839
but it just might work it's so good it

189
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,839
just might work

190
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,040
yes okay

191
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,880
maybe my brain is small but i think this

192
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,440
might just work

193
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,800
all right we're just gonna power

194
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,160
go away just gotta power so what we do

195
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,440
is we flip plop flip

196
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,200
okay follow carefully ping pong this way

197
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,880
we don't need uh

198
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,880
repeaters flip flop flip flop

199
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,080
and then we got to make the signal go up

200
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,720
like your mama's

201
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,560
