actually transporting another with ice

this so basically he will work for me

184
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:56,490
and I will sell him his own crops

185
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,400
now that stinks so whatever hijab he

186
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:08,150
does for me I will sell it back to him

187
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:11,570
how did you escape get back in chamber

188
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:14,570
that's right shame on you so the idea is

189
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:16,820
to just expand the whole the whole way

190
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:20,650
like infinite I want to have as many as

191
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,650
possible keep making bet back

192
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:29,870
yeah and eventually will have it will

193
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:34,190
have infinite Bibby Wallach you're not

194
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:36,620

sleep oh god oh god we have to eat this

224
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:25,279
the first time we get to eat that

225
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,950
relatable moment when you're dragged out

226
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,730
of bed because carrots are raining from

227
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:37,459
the sky all right come on guys make more

228
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:40,399
baby okay so I like my house I really do

229
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:42,320
but I think it's what do you think your

230
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,209
again I think it's time we update it

231
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,160
it's looking a bit small in comparison

232
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:48,160
to everything else we have around this

233
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,790
and I want to make it like a traditional

234
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:55,490
Swedish house I think that could be

235
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:58,640
really fun as well but to build we must

236
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,140
first destroy man this feels weird this

237
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,220
house has been here longer than almost

238
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:08,170
anything in this playthrough that feels

239
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,170
this feels so strange

240
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:18,050
oh my god it's so sad analyst away I

241
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,610
didn't expect to be feeling feels so I

242
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,959
had this house for so long

243
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:27,649
Hey look who caught a couple babies huh

244
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:34,129

gaping get their boats child you're

247
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:44,410
coming with me

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,939
don't think so child look at this that's

249
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:51,949
the one thing that's been with us in

250
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:56,649
number one tree of life wait why do I

251
00:14:51,949 --> 00:15:00,379
hear a tiny one oh my gosh

252
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:04,300
why does everyone make him pay I didn't

253
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:08,480
ask for this congratulations guys

254
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:13,220
damn I'm rich now oh it's all working so

255
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:16,490
well look at that things are going well

256
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:19,100
for once in an episode not really

257
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:23,750
actually but oh look he's teaching his

258
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:25,579
child to be as worthless as his father

259
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,980
come on all right

260
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:30,319
I don't really have the materials to to

261
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,889
build a house I want to build so it's I

262
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:37,670
gamers last episode I blame peepee

263
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:42,610
poo-poo oh my god he's hiding from me

264
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:45,980
now what spawn zone and why did I just

265
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:49,250
spend 15 pounds on it last episode I

266
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:53,500
said pee pee poop who was healing then

267
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,500
with her pigs healing him

268
00:15:54,439 --> 00:16:00,589
are you kidding me the pigment healed

269
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:05,550
him

270
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:07,800
you guys healed him but I was wrong they

271
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,839
actually started us a great decoy and I

272
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,379
feel like the only honorable thing to do

273
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,629
from my mistake my miscalculation is to

274
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:18,689
make a memorial for all the pee pee poop

275
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:21,600
was out there that fought all the brave

276
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:23,730
people poo poos that fought and died so

277
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,670
we could defeat the wither that's why I

278
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,009
want to build a quick little memorial it

279
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:32,160
won't be anything fancy but something to

280
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:34,559
represent each torch represents one

281
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,120
peepee poo-poo this is actually one of

282
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,069
the first things I ever build in

283
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,839
Minecraft I was like hey gorgeous it

284
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:43,829
looks pretty cool I'll just place a

285
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:49,379
bunch of them down it's surreal to do

286
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:54,889
this like 10 years later just but for

287
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:54,889
all the wrong reasons why people

288
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:09,350
[Music]

289
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:09,350
oh my gosh I can just right-click

290
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,410
why hasn't no one told me

291
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:25,860
[Music]

292
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:34,060
there it is like a beautiful

293
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:34,780
whoa that actually looks though and I

294
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,920
missed a spine

295
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:42,520
okay gamers as a final ending for this

296
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:44,950
episode I want to do something with

297
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,020
Jorgen we're gonna write out so I don't

298
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,960
know if this works but someone made it

299
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:53,080
I'll put his imprint in the description

300
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,720
so that if you put down a diamond block

301
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,580
and a nether stall named Petey pie which

302
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,150
of course I just happen to have on me

303
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:04,510
and then throw a sword on it

304
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:09,670
it should create a pewdiepie boss throw

305
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:11,920
them as a star and then a sword did I

306
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:16,540
