[Music]

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,689
this video is dedicated to my editors my

5
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:29,460
brand's there's old boy is roasting time

6
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:33,059
finally finally I'm not the butt of the

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,059
joke hey Brad 1 & 2 huh you're trying to

8
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:40,890
make him look bad huh is that what you

9
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,950
try to do Brad I spend so much time and

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,370
effort and money resources skill

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,090
knowledge to find the right camera and I

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,789
do it and they don't even color

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:56,010
corrected is this so hard learn color

14
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,289
correction I think the thing about this

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,910
whole color correction thing is it used

16
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,920
to be a joke that I had really bad

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,019
quality on my videos but now that I

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,659
finally got better quality I think

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,580
people maybe took it a bit far people

20
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,470
are actually uh neurotically really

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,210
pissed off they're trying to make him

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,580
look like the NiO during the scene where

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,350
he is still in the matrix the last meme

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,710
review was probably the most poorly

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,540
edited video on Felix Channel he was

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:29,970

series that we didn't actually then

41
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,439
realise Peters has been missing for mine

42
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,599
it's almost like I wanted to avoid just

43
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,340
a little bit of controversy just for a

44
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,130
few weeks how about that that's right

45
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,820

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,270
I know controversy mm-hmm that's a new

47
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,450
record

48
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,790

thinking about rockets and cuz he knows

53
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,230
mind that makes no sense

54
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,710
what infinite +1 every meme dies

55
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,500

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,630
roasting whoever uploaded this garbage

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:53,600
dummy dumb bums Sonic or Sonny oh my god

60
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:56,870
the new Sonic looks amazing Wow

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,090
the Pixar team animation has reached out

62
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,700
and they've helped out paramount

63
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,170
incredible job I want to do a Photoshop

64
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,970
where I just Photoshop different version

65
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,090
of Sonic I think that could be funny my

66
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,760
second attempt to feech oh my god I

67
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,790
don't believe this I reacted to this

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,490
lastly why and I remember it this

69
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:20,720
confirms that Brad is trying to

70
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:22,820
purposely sabotage this channel first we

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,330
thought it was a joke that the quality

72
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,580
was bad

73
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,850
they've been clearly doing it on purpose

74
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:31,580
they've been editing wrong means maybe

75
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,590
purposely not color correcting what is

76
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,540
stitch I love this fine art it's super

77
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:41,000
cool look they even drew Brad come on

78
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:43,790
and look they even drew Simon there this

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,709
is so sad I could not meet PewDiePie

80
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,959
but I found a suitable replacement I'm

81
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,840
Papa Gloria what a lot of people don't

82
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,090
know is that any time I'm on an

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,560
interview and doing anything I just sent

84
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,380
up Papa Gloria because we look so

85
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,840
similar it's so strange that she looks

86
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,080
exactly like me when someone stole your

87
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,650

88
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,780
