at least so what I'm funny now I'm a

238
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,800

241
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,310
Joker film well done jontron well played

242
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,269
mission to the next meme the next meme

243
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,040
needs a little bit of context it's a

244
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:41,829
whole dispute with the Hong Kong and

245
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,399
China for those who don't know Hong Kong

246
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:47,560
is a semi-autonomous state from China it

247
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,060
has his own lost lost Testament or

248
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,250
jurisdiction I don't

249
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,319
English is hard already and I don't know

250
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,269
exactly how it works but it's sort of

251
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:57,730
like its own state and in China

252
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,829
obviously wants to change that and Hong

253
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,709
Kong is like nah we want to be free and

254
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:04,689
then I don't know where someone from NBA

255
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:07,149
tweets something saying I support Hong

256
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:09,939
Kong and then NBA is like oh god we need

257
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:12,009
Chinese money so they it just spirals

258
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:13,839
out of control and then the exact same

259
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:16,569
thing happens during a blizzard

260
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,610
livestream we're one of the contestants

261
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:29,350
who won the tournament calls out his

262
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:31,480
support for Hong Kong I think he said

263
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,550
like liberate Hong Kong ethnically or

264
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,759
something like that and these two people

265
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:39,069
the coasters gets fired and blisters

266
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,870
response to this because obviously China

267
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:43,029
is like that one person on Twitter that

268
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:46,540
can't take any criticism and just blocks

269
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:50,439
everyone so Blizzard to appease China

270
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:54,250
fires the hosts and vans the winner and

271
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:56,649
takes away all his prize money because

272
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,959
blizzard needs Chinese money obviously

273
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:00,519
the biggest amount of sales in mobile

274
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,649
games always comes from China

275
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,110
remember when Blizzard announced that

276
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,389
the habló mobile version and everyone's

277
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,790
like is this a April Fool's joke well

278
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:11,800
from a business standpoint no it isn't

279
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,569
it makes perfect sense to get that

280
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,490
Chinese mobile market and that's really

281
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:17,199
all they care about I think it's very

282
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,110
important to remember this because

283
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:22,089
companies they might put up a face they

284
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,949
might put up a rainbow flag and yes

285
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,199
that's good in a way but at the end of

286
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,149
the day their goal is to make money they

287
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:30,069
don't care about you they don't care

288
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:32,259
about freedom and unless people push

289
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:33,040
back at companies they're not gonna do

290
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:36,160
anything

291
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,220
South Park which also at this time made

292
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,670
fun of this whole concept god bless you

293
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,410
South Park how Disney and and many films

294
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,949
chain

295
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,779
they're Chinese version in cinema just

296
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:50,670
to please China it's all about pleasing

297
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:52,019
China and following Chinese rule pity

298
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,110
pipe cheap fuel flavor

299
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:57,959
lingonberry is out link in description

300
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:01,470
buy yours now it is a really good flavor

301
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,779
it tastes just like memes and dreams and

302
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,579
a little bit of meatballs so the thing

303
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,639
is like obviously I wanted to have

304
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:11,279
meatball flavor cheap yeah it wouldn't

305
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,589
taste epic but it is a tradition in

306
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,209
Sweden to have Ling on with meatballs a

307
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,829
lot of people don't eat them I don't

308
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:18,509
know why but it really makes the

309
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:20,970
meatballs so much better when the habit

310
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:23,310
Ling on so we made it out into a drink

311
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,740
gamers and it's really really good

312
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,050
