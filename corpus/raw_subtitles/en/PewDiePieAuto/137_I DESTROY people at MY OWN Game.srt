1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,210
Kevlar fun you haven't played

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:09,240
PewDiePie's pixel Inge it's out it's

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:13,320
finally out I'm so excited obviously I'm

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,770
gonna be biased obviously I love this

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,100
game it's so fun r.i.p PewDiePie Stuber

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,210
simulator it's been real our minds have

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,430
been working on this game for a long

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,130
time we wanted to make a game that was

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,869
more competitive this time we haven't

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,000
launched ranking yet it was coming very

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,309
soon I will do a couple of ranked

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,329
matches later but basically the gist of

13
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:40,260
the game is turn-based realtime strategy

14
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:42,360
i love pokemon pewdiepie it's really

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,250
weird but it's super fun and it really

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,239
works and i think what i really like

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,010
about it is that you can play it

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,670
single-player and multiplayer whatever

19
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,340
way you like to play I'll do an easier

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:01:09,450
level just to demonstrate okay let's do

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:11,100
a map I'm already completed the greatest

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,990
game of all time this story's really

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,450
funny and really cute and obviously

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,090
there's some very old-school PD PI

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,030
references but it's very wholesome you

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,100
know I really like it so I deploy my

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,380
pick slings I have Edgar who does a lot

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,740
of range damage and Maya which is good

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,509
for healing when the orange bar fills up

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,430
that means they're ready to attack and

31
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,900
when the yellow dots are ready

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,240
that means the special attack which

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,840
charges up you can obviously change in

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,369
and switch positions I'll show you that

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,649
in a second what a nice time for me to

36
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,060
do it I tend to just focus on trying to

37
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,560
get down one

38
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,310
I want my I have to take more damage

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,010
dive switcher in the middle do some

40
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:57,400
tanking as well that barrel is gonna die

41
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,590
soon but I also really want the other

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,380
one to die so I'll do my special attack

43
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,640
it does that one run I have a speaking

44
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,060
way to my tree if you haven't played

45
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,619
this game before more more generically

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,780
all the animations are hand-drawn which

47
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:14,830
i think is so cool I think that's a

48
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,870
really really cool thing that I'm really

49
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,959
proud of and it looks so pretty this

50
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,390
game this bro town which is the first

51
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,520
area is literally just scratching the

52
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,280
surface of the game there's so many more

53
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,920
pretty and cool pixel ings and areas and

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,450
things in general that are just I don't

55
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,130
know it's just so impressive to have a

56
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:37,060
mobile game that actually does it took a

57
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:40,630
lot a lot of work to get this hey my

58
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,800
special attack flawless Sarah that

59
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:48,040
that's what I like to see so you level

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,480
up your pixel ings you can find food and

61
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,130
feed them to level them up and if you

62
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,650
find more of extra you can level them up

63
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,870
you'll find your favorite ones and then

64
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,340
you'll keep leveling those up basically

65
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,590

just try and prevent sponsor ego from

117
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:26,750
attacking honestly he's the one that's

118
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:30,980

very nice that was legit satisfy I was

156
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,600
nervous the game is obviously support

157
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,670
this is what we wanted like competitive

158
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,650
gameplay I think that's super fun on

159
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,320
mobile games cuz it's casual it's light

160
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,760
and but it's still like intense which I

161
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,310
really really like

162
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,930
I think they nailed it every time me and

163
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,170
out of minds play against each other was

164
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,940
so fun hopefully soon we'll be able to

165
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,730
you can battle against your friends and

166
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,410
stuff like that but yeah I'm just super

167
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,660
proud of out of mines for making such a

168
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,970
cool game all the feedback that I've

169
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,110
seen it's been really really positive it

170
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,480
seemed like you guys really liked the

171
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,940
game as well which makes me really good

172
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,350
obviously the game is free so obviously

173
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,910
comes with packs and stuff like that

174
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,860
whatever your opinion is on that I don't

175
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,320
know but I'm glad we're able to have it

176
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,550
free I think it's cool

177
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:38,870
considering how much we spent making

178
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:40,850
this I think it's pretty fair okay it's

179
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:46,130
so funny watching Marcia's reaction to

180
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:48,920
the game and all the creatures and yes

181
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,260
we did release this game at the same

182
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,910
date as Pokemon because you know what we

183
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,070
were confident that this was gonna be

184
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,610
the greatest game a long time that's how

185
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,310
we knew hey kids you want to not pay for

186
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,520
Pokemon this game is free it's out it's

187
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:07,160
free it's that big damn that's a lot of

188
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,940

189
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,510

191
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:20,610
boom it up Tennant ah Shannon you suck

192
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,940
so if any character dies so you don't

193
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,709
get 0 deaths which is like I obviously

194
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,079
want 3 stars on everyone so I already

195
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:30,060
messed up but it's still worth

196
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:33,389
continuing to get the exp in the points

197
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,850

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:42,240
you call that damaged I think we notices

200
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,670
well or they told me at least when

201
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,649
testing is that if you're good at the

202
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:51,329
game if you were actually good at it you

203
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:54,089
should be able to win every time no I'm

204
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:59,820
not good against other people I mean on

205
00:09:54,089 --> 00:10:02,070
the same sort of rooster and there you

206
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,490

207
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,639

208
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:08,670
I don't want very nice I want zero

209
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:13,050
that's what you can have rainbow name in

210
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:15,240
Minecraft oh nice quest is a great way

211
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,569
to level up yourself as well definitely

212
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,639
do quests forgot we had that you can

213
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:22,639

214
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,589

255
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,589
with keeping track on your bars you can

256
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,360

257
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:11,200
