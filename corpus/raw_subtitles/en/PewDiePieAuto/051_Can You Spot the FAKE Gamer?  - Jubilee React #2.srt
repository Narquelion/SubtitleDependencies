back in my day when I was young I

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,680
couldn't tell people I was a gamer I

19
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,840

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,739

like nerds gamers and then there was

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,030
this minority of the finest specimen I

they'll split a cash prize oh they get

53
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,000

54
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,320
actually do well well I never actually

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,819

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,009

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,090
research and stuff cuz do they know what

61
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,769

62
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,300
they do they're gonna be the whole unit

63
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,400

64
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,630

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,729
there just like punch them in the face

122
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,889

124
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,289

those a lot of farming for turrets to a

131
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,229
lot of farming oh yeah it's so the point

132
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,070
of the game I understand

133
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:42,610

137
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:55,310
the end fair fair all right

138
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:02,250
[Music]

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,970
basically all saying women can't game

141
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,710
which I would never say cuz that's bad

142
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,910
to say that's the original question I

143
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,960
asked before where I said what's

144
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,330
everyone's favorite video games how

145
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,400
about we just go around saying like when

146
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,200
you first play that games are you

147
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,550
Kingdom Hearts is my favorite video game

148
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,020
ever like a huge part my life I love

149
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,700
that game store and reviews my favorite

150
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,140
I even go through this is I believe this

151
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,400
guy because anyone that has Kingdom

152
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,450
Hearts as their favorite game cannot

153
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,880
shut the [ __ ] up about it

154
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:33,030
so I believe him he's under percent

155
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:35,340
clear no I said much I don't know much

156
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,020
about it you know the Wiis and why I got

157
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,060
to League was because of my friends from

158
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,070
another game we're all transitioning

159
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,330

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,020
camera immediately and started taking

184
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,960
pictures and posting it everywhere just

185
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,520
huge moment right there okay for me my

186
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,680
favorite game would probably be Paper

187
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,190
Mario the very first time I saw the game

188
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,350
my brother played it and I loved it my

189
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,990
favorite game is until Paper Mario is

190
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,640
also a fair like that's another Kingdom

191
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,380
Hearts type of game that people grew up

192
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,840
on so I believe that that's her favorite

193
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,180
game and my favorite

194
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,460
until dawn which we started playing in

195
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,680
college my friend Bree was playing it

196
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,320
and her he started playing it in college

197
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,550
his favorite game is until dawn all

198
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,500
right if he's a gamer he's got no

199
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,910
respect for me it's a good game don't

200
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,730
get me wrong but favorite game

201
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,570
absolutely not absolutely not that's

202
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,000
disgusting

203
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,970
no gamer respect at all favorite game

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,290
until dawn see I think this is this is

205
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,730
it instead maybe I'm not so good at

206
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,800
knots Nate I'd sniffing out the gamer

207
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:31,550
but I'm good at judging people from

208
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:34,520
their tasting video games if you can't

209
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,990
even count you can't even count I don't

210
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,730
see anyone playing on till dawn more

211
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,350
than like five times after that it's

212
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:43,900
like wait why the [ __ ] would you can't

213
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:48,230
even count I'm smelling [ __ ]

214
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:50,510
reference time okay yeah so your first

215
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,520
run who died I don't know that I don't

216
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:56,240
remember that but my memory is terrible

217
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,040
but I do remember some very thick big

218
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,260
jump scares in the game does that save

219
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,760
me oh god I wish I whenever this is

220
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,650
lying game I'm terrible at lying

221
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,870
basically people always suspect it's me

222
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,380
for some reason people suspect I do bad

223
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,330
things

224
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,770
I'll tell upon who dies first well I

225
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,750
know who the main character is it's the

226
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,470
guy from robot yeah so he doesn't die

227
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,940
first

228
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,740
I mean if it's his favorite game and

229
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,330
he's played it countless times he should

230
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,450
know that that's pretty smart of her to

231
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:27,380
ask actually I like like the first

232
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:29,120

242
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,660
all gamers because they just can't

243
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,820
handle any confrontation here like this

244
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:47,500
girl who's clearly like way more alpha

245
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:49,899

Oh like about a character or something

252
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,920

255
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,690
