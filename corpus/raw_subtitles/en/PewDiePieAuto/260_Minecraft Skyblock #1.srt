[Laughter]

134
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:56,210
why did you tear that I told you he

135
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,010
doesn't work I'm a Minecraft man right

136
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:02,180
now I have to restart the freakin

137
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:04,250
service okay well we know that we now we

138
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,770
know that's the way you don't do okay

139
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,840
I'm trying to tell you feelings it

140
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:18,440
doesn't work if you break ice cinnamon

141
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:20,630
toast kid oh there's an orc from

142
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,250
breaking the ice this time you lay with

143
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,500
James Charles doesn't mean I'm like that

144
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,360
how do we melt the ice this isn't making

145
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,790
four maybe you need some time right

146
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,470
maybe or maybe needs to be if it turns

147
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,440
into the next debate wait wait wait

148
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,480
maybe put the ice on top of the the dirt

149
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,880
tray they don't dig under the dirt so

150
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,740
that way it doesn't turn our block of

151
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,990
water into cobblestones that make sense

152
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,750
I don't know what your idea is my idea

153
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,920
is to put the lava on the bedrock I mean

154
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,750
the ice on the bedrock in the pit of

155
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,790
lava over but we can do your idea cause

156
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,400
breaking the ice work I know I know

157
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:55,070
okay look I'm messed up that's fine okay

158
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,540
you mean put that put the ice here and

159
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,970
then put the lava underneath there's

160
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,100
clearly bedrock here for a reason right

161
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,110
so we don't dig ourselves death probably

162
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,000
no but why isn't it why is it not here

163
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,250
then it's not yeah it's not on this it's

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,770
ah well I think we it's because we need

165
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,900
to use it's on that okay okay well tell

166
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,550

167
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,470

182
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,550
attention to me oh I'm sorry

183
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,330
yeah you should be all right let's see

184
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,100
it melt then oh wow it's melting so good

185
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,970
look at it go oh my feet that's looking

186
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,700
hold

187
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,320
are we are we are wait it's ice-cold so

188
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,060
you let me put on top of it well what

189
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,700
did we do before no I wanted to put the

190
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,690
ice on the bedrock I don't know maybe

191
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,730
okay you know what

192
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:22,280
let's let's explore maybe there's other

193
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:26,900
things in here oh I get it I get it you

194
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:29,510
need to burn the tree yeah yeah that's

195
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,730
it okay the tree doesn't burn what is

196
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:35,570
this game there's anything burned this

197
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:37,159
lava burn anything only you burn okay

198
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,010
let's look let's look around let's use

199
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,830
our brains they all get a tree I don't

200
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,590
know I just will assume that you can use

201
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,750
something to make it into water melt the

202
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,460
ice you know but nothing works okay but

203
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,200
here so here's the question for you why

204
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,610
do we need water because the lava and

205
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,630
the water will make up of them then we

206
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,220
can make it all the way out there cousin

207
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,460
try to have enough logs right yeah but

208
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,710
we could also we can cut down these and

209
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,060
I think they drop tree branches and then

210
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,190
we get more trees and we can plant the

211
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,320
trees and then more trees more wait it's

212
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,400
so so that we're gonna sit here and

213
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,630
we're gonna wait for trees to grow

214
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,940
listen I don't make the rules of

215
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,710
Minecraft okay we got to make it across

216
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,450
look I'm almost there these are supposed

217
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,980
to be every Islands like a puzzle that

218
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,020
we got to figure out how to make it work

219
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,760
we're given everything we need all right

220
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,110
we've gotta make that we got criticized

221
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,550
in the water I'm telling you it's not

222
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:31,790
how to do it oh look I got a stick it

223
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:34,640
came from the tree Oh Oh can can kick in

224
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,770
I got it there is a tree branch there I

225
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,990
didn't google this but I know for a fact

226
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:42,800
that breaking this I somehow is supposed

227
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,460
to turn it into water I got it I got it

228
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:57,950
I got it

229
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:59,870
look what there's nothing here tree take

230
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:05,280
that

231
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,280
[Music]

232
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:12,870
three said again break the ice

233
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,170
okay new brain let's try and blame my

234
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,060
kids game alright I'm in again I'm

235
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,290
looking up ice right now it says you can

236
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,540
break it and turn it into a water block

237
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,949
creating water ice can be used to create

238
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,899
water by either melting it or being

239
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:27,000
broken if there's another block directly

240
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,920
underneath the ice block the ice will

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,810
revert to water when broken with it

242
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,120
really you just need to break it

243
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,370
it's what says if there's another right

244
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:46,579
underneath it while you do your stupid

245
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:49,170
ice thing this guy is gonna say dear I

246
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:51,420

well it became ice again possible I was

250
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:12,240

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,940
spaces that it runs over the more lava

362
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:14,820
will make so if anything maybe we should

363
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,520
remove this box and make the lava flow

364
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,810
from really it's as high as possible so

365
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,520
like this make sense to you where would

366
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,589
I say none of the flowing lava right

367
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,760
yeah and then we need flowing water and

368
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:26,700
they need to meet so we need like a

369
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,779
separation can I do anything okay they

370
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,360
have to flow into each other they have

371
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,279
to meet put put up put up the lava put

372
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,800
up the lawn pick it up yeah yeah yeah

373
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:37,320
pick up okay what we're gonna do is

374
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,880
gonna place them as high up as possible

375
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,420
all right but they'll just run into each

376
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,930
other yeah well place scoot scoot over

377
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,899
please

378
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:48,029
scooch Oh scooch over I'm scooch in okay

379
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:50,490
so the lava will go from this one the

380
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:53,270
long tough work it's gonna it's gonna go

381
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:56,310
everywhere and then that's the point

382
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,730
yeah yeah yeah this is good okay this is

383
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,770
