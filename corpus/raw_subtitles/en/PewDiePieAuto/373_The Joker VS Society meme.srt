1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
hey hey there is currently construction

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,299
going on in my office so instead of

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,099
setting up an awkward camera in my home

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,290
I thought now would be the perfect time

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,580
to do a voiceover video I wanted to talk

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,440
about something that's been on my mind

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,219
for quite a while which is ideas around

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,049
the Joker film

9
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,850
yes I'm two months late for anyone to

10
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,119
still care about this but if you clicked

11
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,800
hear me out I wanted to discuss not so

12
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,600
much to film itself what's more

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,730
interesting to me is the reaction to it

14
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,800
and how it was portrayed and perceived

15
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,960
by the media and the audience in general

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,809
and now that the time has passed and

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,280
it's sort of come to a conclusion so

18
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,840
personally I was very happy when I saw

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,360
the trailer had come out The Joker is

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,969
already a somewhat of a subculture meme

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,670
so this led to excitement for more memes

22
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,379
but I was mainly excited because it

23
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,020
started one of my favorite actors

24
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,329
Joaquin Phoenix which seriously why is

25
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,460
it not called Joachim Phoenix English

26
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,410
language please I think he's a

27
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,899
phenomenal actor and I knew he would fit

28
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,879
this role just perfectly a quick side

29
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,920
note here is that in the previous film

30
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,619
that featured the Joker in in Suicide

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,930
Squad the performance was by Jared Leto

32
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,930
which was a questionable display

33
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,340
and according to The Hollywood Reporter

34
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,200
Lleida was fuming over not being casted

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,340
as the new Joker in this film and I

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,020
think it's so funny when people are

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,090
upset over something they have no right

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,130
to be upset about Leto is a good actor

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,370
in all but when you're sending allegedly

40
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,980
according to him use condoms anal beads

41
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,420
live rats threw people on this set I

42
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,100
think he is trolling when he says this

43
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,500
and the rule generally is never go full

44
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,940
Joker never go full butt when the other

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,800
stars in the film were asked about the

46
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,510
gifts they're clearly very uncomfortable

47
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,310
yeah did you get one yes I can't even

48
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,610
begin to tell you the weird things I got

49
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,650
I got a number of gifts to charity so I

50
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,700
don't like to talk about I guess that's

51
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,380
just what happens when you're so

52
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,920
epically immersed in the character of

53
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,660
the Joker on another side note I think

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,940
the fact that Jared Leto who previously

55
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,820
won an Oscar contrasting kwok-him who

56
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,530
never won one and clearly deserves to

57
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,360
there's probably many reasons to why he

58
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,850
hasn't won one but I think part of the

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,850
reason why it's because Joachim is weird

60
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,550
I've been meaning to do a video on him

61
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,560
just him because I find him very

62
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,630
interesting he's the kind of person that

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
you don't really know where to place him

64
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,110
and he clearly enjoys that and plays on

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,060
that but those kind of people are hard

66
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,980
to attribute Awards to and I think

67
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,380
that's why that's exactly the reason why

68
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,200
kwok-him fits so perfectly this role

69
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,299
anyway the trailer came up it all looked

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,160
great people are very excited but the

71
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,890
media's reaction slowly started to

72
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,959
become weird talking about how Joker is

73
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,790
a dangerous film bringing out the worst

74
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,130
of the internet talking about how

75
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,200
killing rampage would encourage copycat

76
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,950
attacks talking about its dangerous

77
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,450
message or insult culture male range the

78
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,820
list went on it went on so much that

79
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,400
Todd Philip the creator of the film even

80
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,049
had to step in and say publicly hey I

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,180
really think there's been a lot of think

82
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,160
pieces written by people who proudly say

83
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,739
they haven't even seen the movie and

84
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,510
they don't need to I would just argue

85
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,250
that you might want to watch the movie

86
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,330
you might want to watch it with an open

87
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,980
mind that's pretty fair

88
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,720
that you at least watched a film the

89
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,940
point here being people were sure this

90
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,120
movies somehow glorified insult violence

91
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,800
or even white rage was mentioned it went

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,540
so far that even during a press

93
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,790
interview with Joaquin Phoenix and the

94
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,980
Telegraph they asked Phoenix directly

95
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,410
are you concerned that the Joker might

96
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,940
perversely end up inspiring exactly the

97
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,910
kind of people it's about with

98
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,520
potentially tragic result Joaquim

99
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,650
walked out and left the interview and he

100
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,600
went even worse from here the military

101
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,060
the US military issued a warning to

102
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,680
troops about the premiere event it was

103
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,030
almost as if media was bracing for her

104
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,980
impact that something bad was gonna

105
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,840
happen but then the movie finally came

106
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,300
out and surprised it's a movie about

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,770
mental health unfortunately this didn't

108
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,960
change the narrative from media that it

109
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,610
was still a dangerous film but I think

110
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,380
what the movie seemed to have mostly

111
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:15,220
inspired was to have a bunch of kids

112
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,049
dancing at a staircase so was it all an

113
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,330
overreaction what had spawned many of

114
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,850
these headlines and concerns came from

115
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,490
what happened seven years ago in 2012

116
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,710
Aurora Colorado a shooting which took

117
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,480
place at a movie theater but it wasn't

118
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,880
just any movie theater it was during the

119
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,910
Dark Knight Rises the Batman film and

120
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,290
the terrorists had red dyed hair and it

121
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,430
was told that the shooter called himself

122
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,530
Joker

123
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,900
so maybe the media's criticism over its

124
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,540
film's release wasn't unfounded then

125
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,820
except this wasn't the truth according

126
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,480
to the district attorney it never

127
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,190
happened

128
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,260
Colorado officials have attempted to

129
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,120
clarify for years that the terrorists

130
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,030
never refer to himself as the Joker

131
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,400
quote the story has persisted because it

132
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,110
fits the narrative so cleanly of course

133
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,120
a crazy haired colored guy who shot up

134
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,370
the Batman premiere thought he was the

135
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,320
Joker of course and yet it has no

136
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,150
connection to reality the narrative

137
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,200
about the Joker association with

138
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,030
violence was false

139
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,290
the film's Dark Knight was targeted

140
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,120
because it was the biggest movie

141
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,770
premiering at the time there was nothing

142
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,600
more to it but despite all the negative

143
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,370
press that recent Joker film received

144
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,730
the movie was still a huge success

145
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,680
attracting ninety 3.5 million on its

146
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,690
opening which is a record for any

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,450
October debit film it became the highest

148
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,960
gross all rated film of all time and I

149
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,850
saw it

150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,020
maybe the hype ruined it a little bit

151
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,460
for me but it was a really great film

152
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,620
I don't think the movies without

153
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,690
criticism is my point I'm not what Times

154
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,120
Magazine would call a staunch defender

155
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:45,650
of it but people have been blaming

156
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,450
movies games music etc as problems for

157
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,060
other people's behavior for decades

158
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,310
instead of blaming you know the people

159
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,240
themselves hell I've even been blamed as

160
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,740
well so why do we do this well it's easy

161
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,780
emotions run high it's hard to think

162
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,820
rationally you want an easy solution to

163
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,560
a complex issue but I would argue it's

164
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,330
time to be more responsible and look at

165
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,160
the bigger picture the reality is that

166
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,330
hate isn't going to stop existing I'm

167
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,070
not gonna pretend that I know how to

168
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,360
stop hateful acts from happening but

169
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,520
there are two things about hate that I

170
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,430
do know number one it feeds off

171
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,950
reactions this may seem like an obscure

172
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,080
example but during World War two in

173
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,300
Japan there was a big concern by people

174
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,920
that most of its beautiful and cultured

175
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,570
and valued structures would get

176
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,550
destroyed by the fire bombings I went on

177
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,770
in Kyoto were one of the most beautiful

178
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,480
structures resides which is the golden

179
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,760
temple was miraculously preserved

180
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,650
throughout the war but ironically the

181
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,660
temple was destroyed shortly after the

182
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,420
war ended anyway and it wasn't from any

183
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,550
war or bombing it was burned down by an

184
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,980
arsonist who tried to commit suicide but

185
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,110
was caught before and later diagnosed as

186
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,780
schizophrenic his motivation was to

187
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,730
quote retaliate against society never

188
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,590
heard that before right to me it begs

189
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,870
the question if the concern for the

190
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,880
temples protection didn't exist would it

191
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,740
still have been burned down Society saw

192
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,140
a likely event as a potential tragedy

193
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,030
and he came true just not the way they

194
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,830
had expected that's why to me the

195
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,930
concern for a shooting in a cinema might

196
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,550
take place which is by the way a valid

197
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,200
opinion to have I'm not saying you're

198
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,750
wrong to be concerned about these things

199
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,970
but it could be potentially a dangerous

200
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,560
thing to highlight just so heavily I

201
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,240
understand that it's not just one

202
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,980
person's fault either for addressing

203
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,990
what could potentially be an issue with

204
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,520
a film but since so many articles came

205
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,860
out prior to its release without

206
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,420
admittedly haven't even seen it it kind

207
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,150
of begs the question if it was all just

208
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:34,190
not pure recklessness my second point

209
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,320
that I know about hate is that it wants

210
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,420
to be recognized not every time but a

211
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,670
lot of times the movie actually depicts

212
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,070
this accurately an outcast a lot of time

213
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,170
one attention they want to be heard even

214
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,270
if it's a dying breath this is I think

215
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,949
an inherent Hey

216
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,889
trading people that wouldn't come from

217
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:53,080
any inspirational source just don't give

218
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:55,150
it to them Arthur in the film was lucky

219
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,900
to get on television as a platform to

220
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,569
get his attention

221
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,610
by coincidence by raising concern that

222
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,349
someone might do something awful you're

223
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,419
basically filling a void for someone to

224
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,949
step in and take the publicity it's

225
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,900
sending a dangerous message to people

226
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,940
that we are concerned something bad will

227
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,889
happen we will platform that bad thing

228
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,050
if it does happen Arthur gets put on

229
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,550
television just to be ridiculed this

230
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,190
performance on the show is what fully

231
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,409
transforms the Joker the irony being

232
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,120
that the media helps create bad people

233
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,860
while platforming them all while

234
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,690
simultaneously thinking they're better

235
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,770
than them kwok-him had every right to

236
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,770
walk out of that question
