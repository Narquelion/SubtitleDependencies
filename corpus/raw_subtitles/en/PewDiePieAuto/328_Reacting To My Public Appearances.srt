[Music]

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,840
pewdiepie here

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,199
master public speaker but it wasn't

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,400
always like this

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,640
oh no no i work my way there by doing a

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,359
bunch of public appearances so i thought

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,680
today

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,160
why don't we just watch them see how i

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,040
improved or gotten worse who knows

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,160
i've done a lot more public uh media

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,160
stuff than i thought

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,000
the very first thing i can remember was

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,760
appearing on swedish television

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,280
we have two free channels in sweden i

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,879
think or is it three i don't know one

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,239
and two and four i think are free

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,920
all alright at least one and two i know

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,120
is run by the state that's like our

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,440
version of bbc

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,160
it looks so awkward to film yourself

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,160
thank you

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,600
i'm glad people feel like that

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
apparently not many people have found

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,360
this

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
video keep it that way oh god so this is

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,920
my very first appearance and i was so

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,920
excited about it

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,840
it was like uh feeling like you finally

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,519
got recognized because i i thought i was

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,159
doing something really

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:15,200
unique for sweden at the time at least

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,600
oh god he's just playing video games

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,119
all the time why is there a duck behind

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,479
you huh what do you do all day

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,600
huh what's wrong with playing video

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,640
games why are you guys saying like that

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,000

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,000
joe rogan so let's go back to um

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,280
i think was it there we go so you can

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,320
swear on swedish television

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:41,840
that's great um the play delivery we

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,360
don't care

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
oh it doesn't even say me on the door

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,680
because i was renting that

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,000
flat second hand that that's how poor i

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,560
was i couldn't rent it directly or find

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,079
one

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,600
just had to rent from someone else mean

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,079
that's how poor i was i was still

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,920

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,840

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,040

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,879
she lives here

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,879
that's a lie oh

56
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,160
and this is the kitchen why do they make

57
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,480
me do this

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
[ __ ] producers they they want to make

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,360

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,120

producers always they're the fault

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,560

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,480

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,319
fit a keyboard on this desk and it's in

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,680

microphone on the desk i remember we

78
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,680
would keep falling down

79
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,680
um

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,159
she's saying that uh old people

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,840
basically boomers

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,840
thinks pewdiepie has the weirdest job

83
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,319
oh my god do you see how clouded my

84
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,840

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,640
i don't know what software i'm using but

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,080
i used that for years

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,159
for i haven't seen her in so years

93
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,000
i think that's the built-in one oh my

94
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,799
god in windows this takes me back

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,879
80 hours played amnesia based i don't

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,879
know

97
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,360
it's so awkward when they're like oh

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,120
okay so now like film your videos

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,360
and like we'll just be amaya

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,879
it's so awkward when they always come in

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,040
and they're like all right yeah now

102
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,439
now like do your thing and we're we're

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,640
just right behind you hovering above you

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,000
it's like when you're trying to type

105
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,280
something on a computer and someone

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
comes up behind you and like what are

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,720
you writing and i'm like

108
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
stop staring [ __ ] i can't type if

109
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,239
you're looking at me

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,680
it doesn't work like that stop hovering

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,439
and this was already a weird thing at

112
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,160
the time like no one did let's plays or

113
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,320
[ __ ] like that so

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,320
um

115
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,000
all right that's another thing that

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
media people do

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,759
they want to get another thing of you so

118
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,199
they ask you a question right

119
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,680
she asked me how many people watch your

120
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,080
videos and i go 30 million

121
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,080
yes

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,960
and i'm like all right right now i have

123
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
30 million a month so they

124
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,800
they don't respond to you they just

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,240
don't say anything because they want you

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,479
to save something else

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,800
because we naturally fill the gap so

128
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,840
she's purposely not saying anything so

129
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,840
she can make it awkward for me i hate

130
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,240
that

131
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
see that

132
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,600
damn stupid media people in their stupid

133
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,240
media training all right so i thought we

134
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,840
would go to

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,840
samsung and see what they are doing over

136
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
here

137
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,639
i want to continue somehow to be active

138
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,720
for my fans

139
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,720
oh today i am

140
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,840
but i think i'll do other projects in

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,039
the future

142
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,680
i guess i did it

143
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,320
maybe even bigger hey well i definitely

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,479
got bigger

145
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,479
this is crazy i forgot about this

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,039
yes

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,199
oh that's right i wanted i wanted to

148
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,600
make my own horror video game

149
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,600
but i never did i wanted to make video

150
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,759
games hey we made pewdiepie pixeling

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,440
still relevant downloaded goddammit

152
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,759
i'm not really that interested in the

153
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,960
horror genre anymore but yeah i did have

154
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,360
a lot of ideas for horror games

155
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,120
and i always thought the horror genre

156
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,479
after amnesia it got a bit

157
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,680
tired you know amnesia did it so well

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,840
that it spawned a ton of clones

159
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
which was really fun for a while but

160
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,039
after a while it sort of killed the

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
horror genre a bit

162
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,240
i think because people weren't

163
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,360
innovating enough and i always thought

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,960
that was so weird because

165
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,360
horror is such a genre where you can be

166
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,720
really creative with who knows

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,160
who knows who knows [ __ ] it i can do it

168
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,039
i have money reclaimed

169
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,039

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,960
how more money is going into the

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,639
internet

173
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:53,680
out of the pocket of all the media

174
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,680
and this is back in 2012 so truth bumps

175

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,599
i'm not sure what he's saying but it's

190
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,160
it's he sounds smart

191
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,759
then they brought up some blogger and

192
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,759
then they showed me these posters

193
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,560
[Music]

194
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,240
so i did these posters where i told

195
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,680
people hey i can write you can write

196
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240

197
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,720
it for you

198
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,720
bad idea

199
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,840
we saw a living room filled with posters

200
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,720
we're not more self-observed now it's

201
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,720
just that more people are watching

202
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,039
again

203
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,720
he's saying oh he's just playing video

204
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,720
games and talking over it

205
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,560
that's crazy and then he says but that's

206
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,440
not what he does

207
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,280
but he's making stand up in a way this

208
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,000
is a totally lame pewdiepie party but

209
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,319
okay i'll roll

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,720

211
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,720

212
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,440
[Laughter]

213
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,959
i forgot about this so i'm basically

214
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,599
saying you know how people always told

215
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,200
you

216
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,640
you'll never get anywhere by sitting in

217
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,240
front of the computer or your entire

218
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,980
life and here i was like

219
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,200
but yeah i made it then

220
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,040
[Music]

221
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
but i proved them wrong all right so

222
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,160
that was pretty much

223
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,680
bro bro bro

224
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,480
so proud i'm so proud we made it bros

225
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,519
we made it hell yeah didn't expect to be

226
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,160
uh so hard hitting the first time

227
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,760
there's too much i i could make three

228
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,760
part series out of this

229
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,800
this was another crazy one i did it was

230
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,360
in 2012

231
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,720
and it was uh in bilbao bilbao was a

232
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,519
really cool city i've never been there

233
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,680
it's in spain

234
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,519
i was speaking in front of audience who

235
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,399
i don't think they spoke english that

236
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,560
well

237
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,839
and i also don't think they really

238
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,160
understood what i did

239
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,200
it was not a good speech can you even

240
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,800
hear me

241
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,240
what happens in the future youtube is

242
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,519
revolutionary

243
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,279
it's something stable you you knew it

244
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,959
youtube had potential

245
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,720
uh but something stable is funny i think

246
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,240
youtube been pretty

247
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,399
good at staying stable but you know

248
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,160
other social media platforms especially

249
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,279
seeing tick tock now getting banned or

250
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,800
whatever you never know what's gonna

251
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,040
happen with this new media

252
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,040
so it always felt like a big gamble to

253
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,040
put all your cards into this

254
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,680
youtube thing it obviously was but it

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
paid off am i a trend

256
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,200
yeah i guess i wasn't

257
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,640
[Laughter]

258
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,920
and i talked about it wanting to make a

259
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,399
game as well look at me

260
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,120
going on stage dying of nervousness

261
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:19,839
wait what is this this is the red carpet

262
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,839
of ender's game

263
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,399
so basically what they do on these i

264
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
didn't know this they have a guy that

265
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,279
goes before you and tells all the

266
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
paparazzis like

267
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,839
this is pewdiepie he's he's important

268
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,399
because of this and this reason

269
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,839
take photos of him now but the

270
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,000
paparazzis have no

271
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,279
chill cause like if you're not important

272
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,720
they they don't bother

273
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,720
like sympathy photos or something

274
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,440
because they they they told hey can we

275
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,560
do without my sand it's like why did i

276
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,560
why did i let that happen

277
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,720
big mistake should not have later go

278
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,160
but i think martial didn't want to be in

279
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
the spotlight anyway so i think it was

280
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
okay but

281
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,360

i understand why felix hates us

377
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,600
norwegians now this interview wasn't

378
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,720
enjoyable at all all those questions

379
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,440
were stupid

380
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,079
really it's from your youtube channel uh

381
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
and

382
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,160
and you must explain please explain you

383
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,199
you play computer games

384
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,600
pretty much yeah any video game there is

385
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,320
that is i like the stupid and silly

386
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,120
games

387
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,399
that no one ever plays i like to find

388
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,639
these

389
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,920
yeah that was my thing at the time like

390
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,959
no one would ever play them because they

391
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,519
were so bad

392
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,320
but then i'll i'll commentate over them

393
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,959
and

394
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,600
make it into comedy somehow so so what

395
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,079
you do

396
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,880
you film yourself while you're playing

397
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,160
pretty much yeah

398
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,399
i it's kind of a ridiculous thing i

399
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,279
just commentate while i play video games

400
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,800
it's oh

401
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,560
almost like he said oh god i get it

402
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,160
like back in the day no one understood

403
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,000
what it was and they would always ask

404
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,320
and i never had a good answer i'm like i

405
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,920
play video games and then i talk over

406
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,040
them and i don't know what else to say

407
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,800
so we're talking about marching here

408
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,000
this might be interesting so i just had

409
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
a couple followers

410
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
one of our friends in italy she's from

411
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,320
italy uh

412
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,480
she sent uh an email to her with

413
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,160
my video in it saying look at this idiot

414
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,590
playing video games

415
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,360
so apparently she liked that idiot but

416
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,399
[Music]

417
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,440
so much that she married him yeah

418
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,839
you you you went not knowing her at all

419
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,360
yeah online yeah you say what you want

420
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,120
about the interviewer but i'm not really

421
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,880
good here either like i'm not giving him

422
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,240
much to work on

423
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,000
keeping my questions very simple so

424
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,480
i don't know you can tell i'm not really

425
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,120
that good i was much more relaxed here

426
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,040
which was backstage afterwards i get

427
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
really tensed up when i get nervous and

428
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,320
i think you can

429
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,959
help your fans and a good way to do that

430
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,720
is to

431
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,560
give them a name that's very common for

432
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,880
example i call my fans the bros

433
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,199
so how would you call your fans well the

434
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:51,839
oldest the oldies

435
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,839
with passion yeah i like yeah

436
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,720
tip number two there's a lot of um

437
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,320
technical aspects for example if you

438
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,920
encourage your fans to

439
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,519
like the video and subscribe you have to

440
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,039

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,160
colbert was

468
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,320
so i felt like i was so much more

469
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,840
relaxed on this one because it wasn't it

470
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,360
didn't feel like a big deal people told

471
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,799
me like oh stephen colbert he's huge

472
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,480
like that's a big deal

473
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,720
but i was like i think it worked in my

474
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,000
favor i never seen him so nervous and

475
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,799
uncomfortable well i guess it didn't

476
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,799
work in my favor

477
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,080
oh my god oh god i wish i could do this

478
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,600

i've gotten so much better you know

481
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,640
i want to do it again yeah i used to be

482
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,679
so much more worried than

483
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,120
depends and nervous i still get but it's

484
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,600
way there i feel like it's way different

485
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,280
now

486
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200

487
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,960
own minecraft series

488
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,039
why am i so wonderful i just made up a

489
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,480
bunch of words like flipping flopping

490
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,840
and they would censor it the necker

491
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,240
worker would sense and be like god we

492
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,280
can't have them saying flip and flopping

493
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:56,000
oh god helvetta

494
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:58,960
oh that's good helmet that's funny

495
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,360
uh see that's a good like comedian

496
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,520
making

497
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,880
observations and she said yeah i got i

498
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,559
got a lot to learn man

499
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,520
i can sense how awkward pewdiepie is

500
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,120
thank you guys thank you for your

501
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,200
encouragement of me trying to

502
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,600
be less introverted and weird in front

503
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,120
of people it really helps to have these

504
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,039
sort of comments in the back of my mind

505
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,200
next time i do a public appearance

506
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,799
i really appreciate that he seems kind

507
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
of uncomfortable i think he's gotten

508
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,400
more confident since then which is great

509
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,120
i definitely have and i'm very happy

510
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,360
about that

511
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,000
it's weird i think ironically the reason

512
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,840
why i'm not on tv anymore is the reason

513
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,440
why i'm probably able to be more

514
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,200
comfortable on tv now because

515
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
all the controversies i think that's

516
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,400
what helped me uh

517
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,440
grow more less self-conscious about

518
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,520
myself i guess

519
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,559
but yeah i wasn't conan as well and it's

520
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,480
i it's just

521
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,840
pure cringe because i was such a huge

522
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,400
conan fan like

523
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,960
look how i'm sitting there it's like oh

524
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,720
god

525
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,919
what is happening are you nervous about

526
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,919
playing with me uh

527
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,400
you know i think you should be nervous

528
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,960
yeah i've seen you play conan

529
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,840
you're pretty pretty awful i'm terrible

530
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,480
i can't get

531
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,400
my play all right it's a little better i

532
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,320
love how defensive you guys are about me

533
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,159
in the comments

534
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,080
pewdiepie cringing so hard at the first

535
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,559
person shooter games

536
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,480
hey first shooter games i can't get that

537
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,679
my character to lift his head to see

538
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,440
where he's going yeah yeah

539
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,440
i literally can't i have trouble and

540
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,840
then i

541
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,640
cringe cringe all right that's about as

542
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,440
much as i can

543
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,080
stomach that's as much as i can take but

544
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,960
i gotta say

545
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,159
um youtube has given me such a weird

546
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,799
unique experience

547
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,760
of growing as a person that no other

548
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,600
environment

549
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,120
in the world i think would have made me

550
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,559
so i'm very thankful for

551
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,640
doing all these things that i was

552
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,520
terrified of doing as an introvert

553
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,120
especially

554
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,559
it was i was dying inside anytime you

555
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
feel like you don't want to do something

556
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,200
and you

557
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,200
you go through with it at least me i

558
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,799
always feel like it's always worth it

559
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,559
and it's good to remind yourself of that

560
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,159
and you'll grow as a person for it

561
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,640
