66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,239
it

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,319
there it is i'll explain this trick

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,640
after because it's so difficult

69
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,000
i can't wait to show this one to marzia

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,800
it also comes with the

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,560
instructions made in india very nice the

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
audience will not be impressed

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,959
that doesn't sound good the audience

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,360
will howl for the doors to be open

75
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,800
wow can't wait for that to happen all

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
right let's perform this one

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,159
the third magic trick is bingo that's

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,480
right

79
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,319
i'm supposed to do this trick where i

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,400
predict what martial put

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,159
it's the dumbest trick probably i've

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,840
ever seen and i i don't even need to

83
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,480
look up the instructions because it's so

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
stupid

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,640
but let's do it fourth trick i think

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,519
this one is gonna wow her

87
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,680
all right this one is a bunch of poker

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,959
chips and i'm gonna guess

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,959
which one marcia picks

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,560
basically it might be cool i think this

91
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,200
one is probably the best one

92
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,400
if this doesn't wow her uh we're out

93
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,040
we're outside

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,040
all right the final trick i'm supposed

95
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,840
to lock one of the cards

96
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,560
inside this device right the problem is

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,599
this is too

98
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,159
big it's supposed to fit a case

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,200
of cards i got like the shitty cards and

100
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,040
they don't fit

101
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,120
so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna have to

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,120
wing this one but hopefully

103
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,920
i it will wow marzia and the final item

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,200
is magic lighter where i'm supposed to

105
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,239
be able to

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,200

107
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,200

do that

270
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,880
you didn't put it in here and you just

271
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,160

272
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,680
all right first of all this is

273
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,880
the thing is this is supposed to be

274
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,640
inside so i'm supposed to slide it out

275
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,399
like as i i'm supposed to like hold the

276
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,800
