268
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
years

269
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,559
i always felt like your content matured

270
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,480
along with me

271
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,840

272
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,160
barrel behind you

273
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,160
i ain't looking at them [ __ ] barrel

274
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,440

275
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,440

276
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,600
15 melee damage so that are

277
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,840

concentration time two seconds headshot

280
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,520
restore i mean this armor is a lot

281
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,720
better

282
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,720
reduces enemy detection speed

283
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,880
reduces all damage by major amount

284
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,880
moderate this is so much better

285
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,600

the wave pattern as a square or

something on the side
