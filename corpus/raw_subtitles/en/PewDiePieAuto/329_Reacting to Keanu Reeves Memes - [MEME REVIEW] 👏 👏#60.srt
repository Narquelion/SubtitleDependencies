53
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,959
supposed to protect him how the media

54
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,870
portrays Puetz oh great

55
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,190

56
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,930
yeah that's so great about Keanu he

57
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,630
always plays his badass but he's such as

58
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,400
soft wonderful guy that just likes to

59
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,590
smell the flowers or at least that's how

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,940
I like to perceive him when everyone is

61
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,769
talking about Keanu Reeves and you're

62
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,560
the first one to use the format from the

63
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,579
matrix no one's ever done this that's

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,190
why it's gonna work

65
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:52,160
I love the matrix it's my favorite film

66
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:55,489
being kind and loving being a bad egg

67
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,410
Keanu Reeves everyone that's exactly

68
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,079
what I mean but really what's making him

69
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,180
so likable like why Keanu what like

70
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,940
what's the big deal he has a backstory

71
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,370
okay promise you won't cry okay promise

72
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,750
you won't cry brawl it one of the

73
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,370
reasons Keanu Reeves is such a good

74
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,930
person is because how much he has lost

75
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,239
he lost his girlfriend

76
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,669
and his baby and he never wants anyone

77
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,470
to hurt the way he did even if it's just

78
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:22,419
with a good attitude he tries his best

79
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,419
to help others and bring them joy

80
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,690
letting fame go to your head staying

81
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:31,669
nice and humble you're breathtaking and

82
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,130
I can really relate to Keanu because I

83
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:34,740

85
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,530
keyonna reason in movies / games Keanu

Reeves in person no one recognized him

87
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:49,349

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:51,599
rain outside his own well that's gotta

89
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:53,880
