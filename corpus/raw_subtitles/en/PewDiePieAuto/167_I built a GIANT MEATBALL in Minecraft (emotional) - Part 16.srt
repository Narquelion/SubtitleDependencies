cow for many years me and Sven have

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,160
built together this structure it's a

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,740
structure that symbolizes the power of

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,189
friendship the power of love and the

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:37,500
power of perseverance I introduce to you

11
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:40,590

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,140

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,750
was finally peace on earth

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,969
isn't that right chicken crap what her

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,399
sheep died for this you know he died to

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,920
make this possible without water sheep

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,719
there would be no giant meatball why did

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,829
I build a giant meatball you might ask

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,460
for water sheep this meatball represents

20
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:07,170
everything that water sheep believed in

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:10,979
friendship loyalty trust and all those

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,979
good things that he stood by what if

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,049
what the Sheep was here alive today I

24
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:18,060
know he would be proud no one loved the

25
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,759
meatballs more than more the Sheep he

26
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,790
was like a father to me it was like the

27
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,250
son that I never had and I loved him I

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,770
may have shown it in weird ways when I

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,869
may have not always been the nicest and

30
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,500
you know I'll admit I may not always

31
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:38,650
been perfect for my god the meatball

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,920
and I'm so proud to call myself an

33
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:45,040
America I don't name them stop jumping

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,230
in boats men please I know you're

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,960
excited but I haven't even shown look at

36
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,720
the press cow over there I haven't even

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,330
shown you guys the best bit so I've been

38
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,370
messing around with redstone I've spent

39
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,010
a lot of time with the Redstone and I

40
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,480
god I hope it works

41
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,520
sorry Sven you can't ride this it might

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,780
break you just gotta hit this and then

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,380
voila baby

44
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,840
it's as glorious on the inside as it is

45
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:18,010
on the outside

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:21,190
Italian leather exterior all handcrafted

47
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,110
by one Scandinavian Swede

48
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,630
it's took a lot of time I'm not gonna

49
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,170
lie I think the elevator took more time

50
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,370
for me to build I thought okay cool I'll

51
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,780
build an elevator

52
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:37,300
that'll be epic not it's not epic I mean

53
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,900
it's it's super fun like I love writing

54
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:43,209
it I want it the idea was to have

55
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,959
something go all the way all the way to

56
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:49,900
the top like the very top and I'm like

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,739
no I'm tired of farming piston steel

58
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,930
material

59
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:55,480
I'm tired of the circuits always messing

60
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,310
up and I don't understand why but it

61
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,290
works for it works pretty well I'm like

62
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,890
it's really fun to write it the thing is

63
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,750
like spent stop teleporting you scare me

64
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,209
what if Sven rides it oh my god I never

65
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,989
thought he's probably too short I think

66
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:13,459
he's too short

67
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:16,190
yeah sorry it's fine you're too short ha

68
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:20,090
ha let's try it the thing is I know you

69
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:23,090
can build elevators probably way smarter

70
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:27,019
I guarantee you that I just wanted to

71
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,519
try it out myself I know you I could

72
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:32,180
probably do it easier so well if I had

73
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,790
the sticky pistons I don't have sticky I

74
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,350
don't have slime I let me see Qiao I

75
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,000
don't I'm stinky poopoo all right I'm

76
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,340
not going near this place when it's dark

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,730
too many creepers have blown up my

78
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,709
circuits too many times for me to leave

79
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,660
it around a dark alright it ain't it

80
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,060
ain't happening alright but let me show

81
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,310

83
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,299
whatever but I didn't realize the red

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,410
thank you thank you friend is gonna go

110
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,060
for a ride

111
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,180
listen I know you're scared of elevators

112
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,660
it's fine trust me are you sitting all

113
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:16,530
right here we go

114
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:18,510
three two one you can sign so basically

115
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,240
the way it works is it's a staircase

116
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,790
it's a glorified stair trace one signal

117
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,160
goes to the upper ones one signal goes

118
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:29,490
to the pusher ones and there one taken

119
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,080
delay and then I don't know it just took

120
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,270
me a lot of time to figure out how

121
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,090
redstone works isn't that right then and

122
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,890
a lot of wool first thing you stone and

123
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,390
I think like the circus would still

124
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,800
connect and I didn't understand why and

125
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,870
then I saw the people use of wool so I'm

126
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
like okay I guess I'll use wool and then

127
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,850
these added delay even if you don't add

128
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,740
a delay to them which added in another

129
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:54,510
mystery to the problem but basically

130
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:57,600
yeah it goes one two three four sad

131
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,960
where is he there you are he's fine eat

132
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,960
something

133
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,260
wait what happened here does it double

134
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,200
sip is that even possible

135
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,169
wait where's the next step pushes here

136
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,350
versus here pushes here it pushes you up

137
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,539
there

138
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,539
[Music]

139
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,010
it still works apparently okay cool I

140
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,090
didn't know that was possible

141
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:26,419
let me try what

142
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:31,060
oh my god it skips a step that's genius

143
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,060
I don't even know what I built so yeah I

144
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,770
it's so satisfying I love the sound

145
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,780
that's why it gets stuck sometimes my

146
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,820
god I was planning to put carpet all

147
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,889
around here maybe like put a floor here

148
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,540
you could have a really big floor right

149
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,220
and then I thought it could be cool

150
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,870
maybe can you do like catapults and

151
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,280
stuff because then like if I have Jurgen

152
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,230
here and we head out an adventure we can

153
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,120
catapult out there into the water these

154
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,889
are just ideas I have I want to build

155
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,810
Sven I want to build it's so fun to

156
00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:02,270
build I love my craft oh yeah you're

157
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:05,240
gonna scan I forgot I lost Jurgen I've

158
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,520
looked everywhere Sven today we bring

159
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,060
back Yuri and he has to be out somewhere

160
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,010

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,100
not over water sheep I'm not over Jurgen

174
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:55,670
being lost I'm not over anything I'm

175
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,560
honestly hurt I'm confused and you know

176
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,960
depression shows its way in many forms

177
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,890
and I chose to build a giant meatballs

178
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:06,380
other people do other things okay but

179
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:09,260
now that meatball is built I still feel

180
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,910
the pain it's still there let me see if

181
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,860
I can find something else like a

182
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,560
substitute right I need to make this

183
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,050
