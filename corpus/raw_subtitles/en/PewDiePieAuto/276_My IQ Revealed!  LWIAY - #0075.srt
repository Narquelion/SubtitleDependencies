channel to get 200 million

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,000

youtuber to get

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,320

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,920
stomping all over the smaller youtubers

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,680

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,399
felix puts a giant watermark on the

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
screen

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,320
whenever he says something controversial

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,719
stating this was taken out of context

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,960
the media cannot use it as evidence now

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,119
they'll just use it as a quote anyway

46
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,840
well listen i'm not trying to get them

47
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,920
that hunting media rhetoric but

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,040
they can just take whatever as a quote

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,480
and say that's it

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,319
it's not like they're going to be oh

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,959
there was a watermark on this

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,520
saying it was out of context turns down

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,599
quality to

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,520
