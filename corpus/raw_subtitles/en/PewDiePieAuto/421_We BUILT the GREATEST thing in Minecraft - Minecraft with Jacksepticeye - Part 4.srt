complain that we don't get enough done

228
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,000

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,100
like mega stairs going into the front of

431
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,070

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,899
steps going all the way yes and then we

438
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,970
hollow out some of the middle of it and

439
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:14,260
then go up into the middle and inside

440
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,850
we'll have a bunch of parrots and a

441
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:23,409
jukebox and they will be a priority yeah

442
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:25,539
take a little long there I'm so bored

443
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:28,510
that I just didn't fully grasp the full

444
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:30,279
concept of it uh-huh yeah all right I

445
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,020
got blue screen again from playing

446
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:34,480
Minecraft this is the fourth time we

447
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,980
could make a piston door we can keep the

448
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,480
symmetrical shape of the

449
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,750
you can still have an interest coming

450
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,490
from the bottom ooh yeah like that this

451
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,290
became our new mine I like that build

452
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,110
this whole entrance thing this is just

453
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:49,870
for now this is just to steal rock I see

454
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:58,690
the other one is ceremonial we borrow

455
00:21:49,870 --> 00:22:02,440
from earth too late nom nom nom so what

456
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:04,809
if we burn down village build our house

457
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,950
the only thing that will be just to be a

458
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:12,010
temple of fire spit out flames

459
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,049
we brought fire to your village I'm just

460
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,280
happy that we're doing something that

461
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,710
doesn't have all you dying

462
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,490
that just doesn't involve us talking in

463
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:23,200
a Swedish accent foreign oh I remember

464
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,240
back in the day when I did like the

465
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,799
montages right yeah what I was trying to

466
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,480
create those moment as much as possible

467
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,210
like I went always having that in mind

468
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,980
just because oh yeah got it okay if I

469
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:36,010
exaggerate a little extra head then

470
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,299
perfect for the mountains later when we

471
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:40,900
completed it everyone be like how you

472
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:43,270
built that you must have used created my

473
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,700
meatball people say that about my castle

474
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,160
it was even saying as well like oh I

475
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,720
built it using creative I mean survival

476
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,210
because I tripped myself up thinking

477
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,410
about creating so much whatever was

478
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:58,299
gonna be like he did it he said it

479
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,250
exposed draw alert I want to see this

480
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:02,070
from our other spawn I'll be able to see

481
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:06,929
it from space

482
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:09,970
Chinese wall and upside and peering me

483
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:12,340
they're having a party might a few yeah

484
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,530
we're doing last time okay break it up

485
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,040
you guys break it up go home actually

486
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:24,100
work I refers to go polish touch people

487
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:28,780
in a party 2009 their outfits look like

488
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:31,840
Dutchman's I guess so right mix up touch

489
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:34,600
and where's the sound of music recording

490
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,130
Austria that's very different it's the

491
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,390
same country it's gonna say maybe we

492
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,630
should take out the block at the very

493
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:44,269
bottom so it's a floating permanent OSE

494
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:48,200

how do you get in now is how you answer

498
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:02,809
maybe you could build a water elevator

499
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:04,669
underneath it

500
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,889

505
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:17,479
done we steal the bell and we put it on

506
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:19,669

00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:53,659
things uh-huh and I went to sharpen them

544
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:55,489
and then the freaking wind like keeps

545
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:56,400
blowing the bike sideways as I'm going

546
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:57,960
down destroy

547
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,159
see I was gonna go with the pedalboard

548
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,710
and then I looked at the weather and

549
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,169
this is like yellow warnings not that

550
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:07,980
bad and then just a storm hit and I'm

551
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:11,279
like okay this is the wind stops I've

552
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,169
been waiting ok so we have one standard

553
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,900
in the middle here oh you should make

554
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:17,309
for everything has to be symmetric yeah

555
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,130
I like it though it's very pleasing to

556
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:30,390
the eye okay anymore so peasants you're

557
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:31,320
all a bunch of fools poor a basket no

558
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,230
glory

559
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:39,710
there's not even any like subtlety to it

560
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:43,830
anymore it's just poor weak small break

561
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:46,980
me big top of Egypt so how do you get

562
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,990
out of it pyramid and how do you guide

563
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:54,090
it that's something we figure out later

564
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:56,309
you pick up the trace hello did they

565
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,440
they they invent how to extinguish fire

566
00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:00,390
first before you mending fire I don't

567
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,890
think so alright I never thought of that

568
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,500
you're just blowing my mind right yeah

569
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,779
probably the demise of humanity it's the

570
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,870
fact that we always invent stuff before

571
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:11,460
we figure out how to put it out

572
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,399
yeah the safety measure comes second

573
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:17,309
yeah destroy first rebuild second I'm a

574
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:19,049
fool jump to trees stay with the

575
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:20,880
peasants oh I saw you jump that was

576
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:24,690
happening they're having a pool party

577
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,970

yeah help build the tower build our

580
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,190
tower is an affront to God I feel like

581
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,350
we have to take down one of their houses

582
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,179
if we look at that house it looks better

583
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,340
without their houses I'm gonna destroy

584
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,940
the ones around the tower should we blow

585
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:45,809
it up do we still have that TNT on you

586
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:49,340

587
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:52,380

up the stairs or triple in the

597
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,280
excessiveness is happening but you spent

we figure out the countermeasure exactly

636
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,370
to err is human

637
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:46,900
and also arrogance and all other bad

638
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:49,179
