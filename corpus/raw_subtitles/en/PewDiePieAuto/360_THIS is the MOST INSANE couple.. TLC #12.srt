little bit what the [ __ ]

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,160

scattered all right here we go pedro age

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,160

they learn spanish together

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,960
over the app like those apps where you

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
teach each other the language

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,640

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,799

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,760
and then they oh why do i know this

filling my brain with

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
anyway let's watch i actually have no

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
idea what happened after that so this

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,640
should be interesting what

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,920
what has happened between pedro and

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,200
chadel

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
that's how you say their names in

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,880
dominican republican no whatever

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,960
everything's right okay that's smooth

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,080
see those uh spanish-speaking countries

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,119
they are smooth

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,720
don't worry baby everything is okay okay

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,920
don't worry baby everything is gonna be

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,640
okay doesn't even speak the language but

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
he knows how to sweesel in there

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
i'm really confused about my marriage

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
right now uh-huh

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,079
why confronted pedro about what he said

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,759
last night at the winery

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,840
and how he's planning to go back to the

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,680
dr he's going back to the dr

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,000
oh the dominican republic i thought she

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,920
meant doctor

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
that you had serious plans to go back to

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,640
your country and we haven't even spoke

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,040
about this

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,759
yeah i think what's fun about these

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,640
is figuring out who's the villain right

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,800
there's always

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,679
either it's the foreigner or it's the

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
local one

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,720
i'm saying localized america is local to

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,720
me but the

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,319
medicare republic is probably closer but

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,920
that's the fun is it pedro

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,599
yeah don't worry baby everything is

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,239
gonna be okay i'm not going to leave in

61
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,480
there

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
she gone there for a couple of a couple

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,280
of weeks maybe

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,760
one two weeks he doesn't want to go back

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,200
to dr maybe he should eat an apple

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,200
because it keeps the dr away

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,319
that's fine i don't need that to some

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,879
degree

69
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,680
but i still feel like i don't know what

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,560
pedro's

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,040
true intentions are for our future i

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,200
think

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,200
pedro wanted a little better what's

74
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,519
covering half your body jesus christ

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,800
and he was done anyone leaving you here

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,280

85
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,440
about what was said yesterday

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,080
ah god i know what it is oh my god

87
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,680
he sounds like the guy from the room

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,319
thomas please

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,440
i don't want to talk last night you know

90
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,480
it's america when they have

91
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,360
juices this in size pedro mentioned that

92
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,760
he would be

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,480
going back to the island so that's the

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,959
mom

95
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,000
and that he would not be taking chantel

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,000
with him

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,680
desperate to find out what actually is

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,239
going on with people what happened

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,440
in the dr we could find something

100
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,720
extremely sinister

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,799
we were definitely on the impression

102
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,440
that you were going to go to school

103
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,440
once chantelle finishes school he was

104
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,799
gonna go back to school

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,720
oh i remember now i remember now

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,239
okay i can get backstory this is the

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
problem because on the internet they

108
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,120
don't upload the whole

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,560
context but i remember so i can explain

110
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,640
it to you don't worry

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,680
she lied right she said he was just

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,120
gonna come over

113
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,120
to stay for a little while like two

114
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,879
weeks but she didn't mention that they

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,319
already got married

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,840

i would love to be this guy we were

118
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,639
definitely on the impression that you

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,120
were

120
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,560
hey pedro we were definitely under the

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
impression that uh

122
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,840
you were gonna get the [ __ ] out of here

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,400

237
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,200
and they're already fighting so much

238
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,040
she could have a better guy than pedro

239
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
all right okay i guess pedro is the

240
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,320
villain

241
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,120
pedro has an extremely strong bond with

242
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,080
his mother

243
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,920
he's a mama's boy but i think another

244
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,000
good reason to not marry someone

245
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,519
because you marry someone that's a

246
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
moment boy you're not just marrying one

247
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,600
person

248
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,279
and we've seen that over and over on

249
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,320
this show that's a package

250
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,240
deal right there he shares a little too

251
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,320
much with his family and he should keep

252
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,720
our private business

253
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
private

254
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
so

255
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,049
[Music]

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,560
it's almost like she doesn't even care i

260
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,079
understood all of that

261
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,720
i mean there were subtitles but still

262
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,480
come on stupid americano

263
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,480

265
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,519
wow i cannot deal with pedro's mom's

266
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,079
negativity right now

267
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,519
yeah what the hell i basically found out

268
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:09,120
that our whole marriage

269
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:11,440
is a scam why i knew it i saw it

270
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,160
i knew it ever since i drank that apple

271
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,680
juice

272
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,040
plot to use another person

273
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,800
it's almost borderline body trafficking

274
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,920
yes is it is it yeah

275
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,839
pedro has crossed the

276
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:33,200
line i think as a parent pedro

277
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,760
has gone one step

278
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,480
two chances mom was made for reality tv

279
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,680
you're right

280
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,000
holy [ __ ] step in to try to talk to

281
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,360
pedro to try to handle the situation we

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,839
should just go over there we need to

283
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,000
know that

284
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,959
you should talk to pedro don't go to my

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,880
house i am going to do something

286
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,160
stay away from my house oh [ __ ] they're

287
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,320
going to go to their house

288
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,000
they're going to go to pedro i shouldn't

289
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,839
have told you anything this is

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,200
my relationship yeah right i mean why is

291
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,120
their family so involved that's just a

292
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,800
recipe for disaster because everyone's

293
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,000
gonna have a different opinion

294
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,160
and at the end of the day you need to

295
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
make your own it's your relationship

296
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,399
not your family's relationship but it

297
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
seems like on both sides it's so deeply

298
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,320
connected

299
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,160
there was a big fight if my family goes

300
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,240
to see pedro right now

301
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,440
it's only going to make things a million

302
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,839
times yep

303
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,839

304
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,639

oh my god holy [ __ ] i was not expecting

311
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,800
that

312
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,880
i am going to meeting with immigration

313
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,480
lawyer all right how are you doing

314
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,720
yeah good my mom and my sister

315
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,800
to living in the united states for the

316
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,000
state over here with me

317
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,440
i don't think that that's not how it

318
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
works yeah it's not everywhere that's

319
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,760
not going to work dude i live here i'm

320
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,240
gonna leave over here

321
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,440
okay you need to be a u.s citizen before

322
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,839
you can sponsor them

323
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,440
oh okay okay so there's a chance all

324
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,959
right they don't get citizenship

325
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,200
as soon as you get married right you

326
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,880
just get a visa to stay

327
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,320
and then after a couple of years right

328
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,839
you can apply for citizenship i think

329
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,399
that's how it works he's got

330
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,160
two years before he's a citizen uh i was

331
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,600
right mother's process will probably

332
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,360
take about a year and a half

333
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,040
but there is an exception if you're

334
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
married to a u.s citizen

335
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
then you are eligible right away in

336
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,160
order to

337
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,680
fall under that exception you have to

338
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,279
show that you're still married that

339
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,880
you're living together

340
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,480
you're providing additional evidence of

341
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,160
the relationship

342
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
and then you could have an interview

343
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,639
together

344
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,639
with you and your wife

345
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,399
yeah what's wrong with that a little bit

346
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,279
scared see somebody coming for the

347
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,839
interview

348
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,720
and then my wife you want to go with me

349
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,800
well why wouldn't she

350
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,399
[Laughter]

351
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,320
but the requirement is that she would

352
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,000
need to attend yeah that's

353
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,800
that's some pretty basic [ __ ] there

354
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,519
pedro do you feel like that my mother my

355
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,639
sister

356
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,959
never treat chantel well

357
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,079
and then maybe so maybe you should stand

358
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,760
up for your wife

359
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,440
say this is the woman i married and i

360
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
love her so you have to respect her if

361
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,399
you respect me

362
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,519
