front of us really actually before we do

246
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:44,070
that let's talk about last Christmas

247
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,480
just like I told the cops the

248
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,010
allegations

249
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,190
that we have murdered the Santa Claus

250
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:55,290
and single-handedly ruined Christmas

251
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:57,870
I'm telling you that might be true okay

252
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:02,070
fine and so is the part about me having

253
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,850
illegal weaponry but he did fly over our

254
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,910
property

255
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,550
so technically South defense well I did

256
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,769
tell all that to the sheriff and he

257
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,019
actually was very understanding an x-ray

258
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:16,050
he wrote everything down and now we're

259
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:39,060
wanted but don't let that break down

260
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:51,000
your spooky spirit never follow me well

261
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:54,449
this is something the south maybe not

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,279
yet oh you must be wondering where the

263
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:59,010
party immerse the party it's on the

264
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:02,910
other side of the castle hold on hold on

265
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:06,660
I utilized my bony ingenuity Europe ena

266
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,730
and created a trolley of sorts that will

267
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:14,130
effortlessly transport us to the party

268
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:16,410
itself what what are you looking at you

269
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,959
don't think I'm able to how dare you

270
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,480
well either way you're right I did not

271
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,549
make the trolley I just found it's here

272
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,199
and it's missing a few parts I need to

273
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:27,720
get the part good news they're in the

274
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,990
local storage and the South bad news a

275
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,120
crazy woman ghost haunts that place but

276
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,830
it's either a haunted dungeon or the

277
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,419
entire castle so chop-chop I'll wait

278
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,730
here until you find all the missing

279
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,890

situation from which I will never escape
