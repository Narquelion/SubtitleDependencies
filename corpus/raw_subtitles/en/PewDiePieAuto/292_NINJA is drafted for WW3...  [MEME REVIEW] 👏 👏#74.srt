87
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,530
positive end there's nothing bad just

88
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:54,599
event when American gamers meet Iranian

89
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,540

of ammo because I was reloading after

227
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,279
doesn't automatically refill all my I

228
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,050
remember when I was a kid and I play

229
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,670
battlefield and you can't do that

230
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,230
obviously you loose a bunch of ammo and

231
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,040
I think you might a fill and he's like

232
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:40,019

233
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,930

00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,560
drafted in war shooting guerrilla World

235
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,389
War three

238
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:52,930

Germany voice if World War 3 happens

243
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:06,310
historians will have to analyze our

244
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:08,110
memes as primary schools what was the

245
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,850
real cause of the outbreak well there

246
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,190
was a lot of memes there was an

247
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,670
overwhelming amount of memes wanting it

248
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,740
to happen

249
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,080
I like how I made a video criticizing

250
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,640
the media for wanting a shooting to

251
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,610
happening in correlation with the Joker

252
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,550

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:30,370
where you can rank up in real life what

255
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:35,730
when the guy with 900 plus hours in

256
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:37,959
World of Tanks gets drafted oh my god

257
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,440
when you find out priests don't get

258
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,480
drafted

259
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,850
what priests don't get drafted all that

260
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,910
would be so epic that's just that what a

261
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,830
disappointment I didn't know that 0.4

262
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,080
seconds after landing in Iran not like

263
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,209
the simulations this is not like the

264
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,250
simulator at Germany realizing they are

265
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:56,649
not guilty of this one I'm sure they'll

266
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,870
find a way when your special ed but the

267
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:01,420
government decides to deploy it to Iran

268
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,130

269
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,400
already seen a million times

270
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:08,380
