00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,589
hello before this video begins I have

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:09,690
exciting announcement I'm partnering up

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,700
with the daylight that's right everyone

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,250
for those who don't know what deal is

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,900
it's a live streaming platform live

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,590
streaming is coming up in the future

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,600
that seems like a great idea Felix D

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,090
live is built of the lunar blockchain

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,310
they provide a disruptive solution for

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,980
the industry what does that mean let me

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,560
tell you D lives mission is to empower

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,410
creators but how you may ask through

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,690
their revolutionary reward system number

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,270
one they take no platform cut so

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,340
basically if you donate to a streamer or

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,840
if you subscribe to a streamer the

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,239
website itself usually takes a

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,610
percentage of that not on the line it

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,219
all goes to the Creator pretty cool

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,739
number two viewers as well can earn line

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,170
o points which is the currency simply by

22
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,550
engaging with the streamers pretty epic

23
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,920
number three is one that I really like

24
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,899
as well because users themselves get to

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,780
influence the shape of the platform

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,670
guide where its direction is going and

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,380
also get rewarded for it for having the

28
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,700
line of points personally I think it's

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,159
really cool to have a creator base

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,780
website actually putting creators first

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,920
so I'm really excited about the live and

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,479
I'm really excited to finally be

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,950
