11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,410
to do

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,750
first things first I've been meaning to

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:49,519
do this for a long time

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:57,170
chop dead no more beetroot Oh see that

15
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:59,780

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,659
episode will be focused on IKEA Tower we

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,810
have the new glorious IKEA Tower with

18
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:08,510
one fatal flaw there's no way for Jurgen

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,240
to get up there it's just impossible not

20
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,820
fair we need to build a horse ladder

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,100
which is also known as cake ladder

22
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:22,189
that's right cake ladder you heard me

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:25,159
right we need to somehow get rid of the

24
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:27,649
old tower but it needs to be respectful

25
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,170
okay it needs to be done in a respectful

26
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:34,869
manner we will do both of these things

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:40,789
the ingredient for cake to make a cake

28
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:42,200
it's of course sugar milk and egg so we

29
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:43,969
need to build a farm for both these

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,630
things it shouldn't be too hard I

31
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:49,249
already have a milk farm aka cow too but

32
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,069
I want to build I want to build that

33
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:52,909
little cute little chicken house so

34
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:56,240
we're gonna do that

35
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:59,869
where should we build it here okay let's

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,479
build a hair spin good old-fashioned

37
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:08,810
building with my boy just watch out for

38
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:09,850
that creeper spin why do I hear chickens

39
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:15,840

if you think I look like you know more

46
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:37,300
trashy than usual just know it's because

47
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:39,150
I've been playing Minecraft I get

48
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,340
somebody comment sometimes being like Oh

just put a bunch of hoppers into one

59
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,580

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:13,720
make it for them to move the better the

61
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:14,260

fast milking damn it this seemed like a

123
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,930
good idea it's a piece of cake to make a

124
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:45,409
pretty cake god damn this thing is a

125
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,060

127
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,719

man with a dream I'm a visionary so the

134
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,400
idea of the ladder cake is that you can

135
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:19,980
walk up each step because you can eat

136
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,480
the cake in six steps

137
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:31,990

138
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:33,550
a cake lighter my god one one day I'm
