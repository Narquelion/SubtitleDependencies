1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,270
Big Ed Andros the love story of the

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,639
century the show is aired it's all

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,500
finished it's all done for but what

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,290
really happened afterwards

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,350
what's the follow-up welcome to Big Ed

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:32,290
Rose aftermath

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:35,290
[Music]

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,290
yeah

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:43,300
[Music]

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,059
last episode love was over Edie was

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,910
crying in fierce Rose had seen through

12
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:52,960
his multiple life's and was not having

13
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:55,570
it anymore he already has his branding

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,370
what the hell I didn't notice that

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,180
that's so funny that actually makes

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,220
sense for later

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,080
honestly impossible who would have

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,510
thought this relationship based on such

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,759
a foundation of lies would not work out

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,950
I don't get it

21
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:10,390
it just doesn't make sense to me I feel

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,430
like based on stuff like this because

23
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,170
they obviously met online and I met mine

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,149
see online but I always felt in the back

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,009
of my head but I really needed to meet

26
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,270
her because it's not it's not a real

27
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:21,280
relationship unless you've actually

28
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,160
interacted with each other it's not the

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,350
same thing sorry online relationship

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,170
people but just once this quarantine is

31
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,869
up let's hit it up bang it out you know

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,100
I'm saying so you think I'm bad and just

33
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:35,890
I'm a bad person okay

34
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,350
yeah I love that part I love that

35
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,710
response you think I'm bad I'm a bad

36
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,520
person

37
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:45,910
yeah yeah and I also was just say for

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:49,000
the record yes and is a bad person he

39
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,679
lies he does a bunch of bad things but I

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,750
don't think they're that means that he's

41
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:54,369
a lost cause or anything okay

42
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,349
I hope that he takes from this

43
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:58,630
experience as a learning thing and

44
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:00,369
recognize his flaws because I I mean he

45
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,220
has good parts to add on what it's just

46
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:05,440
like and it's the worst I hate him and

47
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,810
sucks like these are common flaws in

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,880
many people and just have many of them

49
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,380
which is okay you learn from them you

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,330
grow from them hopefully if not so

51
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,800
there's an updated click where Big Ed

52
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:27,000
tells his mom roses out as roast

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:36,690
oh no oh no don't make me cry

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:38,340
Rosie's yeah she's no rose and to be

55
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,290
fair bigoted looks a lot better with the

56
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,670
beard so I think Rose was actually wrong

57
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,220
on that one

58
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:59,460
marzia tells me to shave all that time

59
00:02:44,220 --> 00:03:02,340
why am i defending it so excited make me

60
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,000
feel sad that things didn't work out for

61
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,770
him

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,780
there was a lot of doubts in my mind how

63
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:12,200
can you fall in love with somebody

64
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,200
online told you you gotta meet first

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,599
oh she should have had a roast that

66
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:18,370
would have been so epic that would have

67
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,930
completed the anime what is that it I

68
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,230
should know that I play animal crossing

69
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:27,340
what is that flower for so what happened

70
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:31,720
mom asks I wanted to it's the full story

71
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:34,780
bring her over on a k1 visa but I asked

72
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,129
her you know what she wants and out of

73
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,599
our relationship and that's when she

74
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:44,140
told me you know she wanted two kids I'm

75
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:47,079
not even ready to be a father to Prince

76
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,870
let alone you know father two more kids

77
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:51,010
at 54 years old

78
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,359
when I told her I didn't want more kids

79
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,709
that upset her and and I would ask her

80
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:58,510
about her past mom and she didn't want

81
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,459
to talk about her past I feel like you

82
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,620
left that a little bit of details there

83
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,709
and but I understand you're talking to

84
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,659
your mom it's okay he conveniently

85
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,250
forgot to tell his mom that he lied

86
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:11,769
about his height lied about wanting to

87
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,310
have kids refused to send $75 to her

88
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,349
sister

89
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,000
then blame broach criticize her village

90
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,010
and home mocked her family in their

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,660
living situation and poverty called rose

92
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,389
controlling for helping him with his

93
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,599
wallet and giving the seller literally

94
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:27,340
20 cent tip force prince to stay at home

95
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,260
when they left the hotel guilted her

96
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,020
about her past forced her to take in a

97
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,389
city - I didn't force her but yes told

98
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,349
her her precious things I didn't see

99
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:40,150
that what the hell

100
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:42,849
bought her toothpaste and my area girl

101
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,669
rose for no reason whatsoever I have

102
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,970
brought you a gift don't look too into

103
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:47,710
it

104
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,650
I just like to gift people these things

105
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,199
I get I get that it's awkward to talk to

106
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,820
people about their hygiene a pen I think

107
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,039
I read somewhere that Rose had an ulcer

108
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,970
why do I know all the new ones a sample

109
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,830
this is pathetic

110
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,770
and that's what caused her to have bad

111
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,030
breath but anyway forced her to shave

112
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,830
her legs and call the gross

113
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,510
it didn't force her but he wasn't really

114
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,880
subtle about it either let's get real

115
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,740
here get her drunk on champagne to have

116
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,990
his way

117
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,420
I don't know bought her panties and bras

118
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,520
just so he could see her in them I mean

119
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,170
come on guys do that I don't do that but

120
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,790
I know guys do that she didn't think I

121
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:27,040
trusted her son what what that makes

122
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:32,650
perfect sense actually a me I don't know

123
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:36,630
what else you could even add mom agree

124
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,250
so and has his face on three different

125
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,960
kitchens

126
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,900
that's branding right there even before

127
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,700
the show is finished I hope Rose does

128
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,830
not talk to end I find it really

129
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,330
annoying this is what guys do they just

130
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:54,010
give it some time and then they sling

131
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:56,020
her back in and then they're like um but

132
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,250
they haven't changed at all don't do it

133
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,220
roast is what I'm saying

134
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,470

175
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,449

00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,199
corrected I just measured myself I went

186
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,330

came with so come on just own up to it

195
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,479
so I wasn't completely honest with Rose

196
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:26,849
about that and a couple other things

197
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,679
couple other things there's like all

198
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:31,559
these things against you and you just

199
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:32,219
defend the weakest one and as I a couple

200
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,810
of things

201
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,709
oh yeah the height thing I a couple I

202
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:41,130
think classic that I'm you know you're

203
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:44,880
yeah it's it's never a good idea to to

204
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:47,009
say it to line thank you I'm learning

205
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,600
that I hope so I hope so

206
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,699
strong feelings for somebody it's better

207
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,800
you know to get it out in the open

208
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:54,509
mmm-hmm if not it's gonna come back and

209
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,680
bite you did it come back and bite you

210
00:08:54,509 --> 00:09:00,389
oh yeah see this is all I want I just

211
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,579
hope you learned from it there's a lot

212
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:04,079
of everyone lives but she's not lying in

213
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:05,970
a relationship that's not a good idea

214
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,509
right Edgar he's trying to get

215
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,800
comfortable

216
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:09,300
come on have you guys had a lot of

217
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,769
growth since then I know you can't tell

218
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,939
me everything but it that's it's a lot

219
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,800
for her to process okay so how would

220
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:15,569
they doing that is and what a really

221
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,829
good place that's all I could say we're

222
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:21,420
in a really good place

223
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:24,269
oh I beg to differ it's not good to like

224
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,459
we're in a really good place so

225
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:29,880
apparently they haven't spoken at this

226
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:32,700
point at all I guess he had to lie or or

227
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,770
or say something to kind of

228
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,700
cuz the show hasn't fully aired at this

229
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:43,110
point I think at least I'm not sure Rose

230
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:51,620
responds on her Instagram oh my god and

231
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:54,000
the story is different she wants to say

232
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:59,760
tell us the scoop roads tell us the

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
scoop how dare you in front of million

234
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:07,530
people these people don't believe him is

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,140
fake movie that's really really she does

236
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,480
really care of me he doesn't really care

237
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,230
about you famous that's why he just was

238
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,000
saying oh my that's a lie

239
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,950
obviously Big Ed doesn't want Fame

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,290
that's not why he put merch on his face

241
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:25,440
everywhere that has nothing to do with

242
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:28,380
it alright I always talk about youth you

243
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,490
are always liar he's always liar you

244
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,130
tell them girl

245
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,870
you tell them always like the fact that

246
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,720
she didn't get money from the show yet

247
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,130
he did is gross damn I guess he's the

248
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,630
one that contacted the show and signed

249
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,670
the contract and she just kind of went

250
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,230
along with it that's unfortunately how

251
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,850
it works I don't know actually

252
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,560
she should have definitely gotten paid

253
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,690
if she was part of the show right she

254
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,720
was part of it as much as he was okay so

255
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,790
this is a more recent interview during

256
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,020
social distancing I woke up last 90 more

257
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,140
teen and it wasn't a good morning

258
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:02,580
because all of the the haters came out

259
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:06,510
because I had asked rose to you know she

260
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:09,390
would shave her legs those haters huh I

261
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,040
get it it's like Internet people get

262
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,990
caught up because obviously it's not a

263
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,700
big deal it's not the worst thing that's

264
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,040
anyone's ever done but it is worth

265
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,200
criticism but then it all gets lumped it

266
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,530
up and it goes overboard and it just

267
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,940
becomes mud and by the internet and

268
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:31,980
unfortunately just gets brushed up hey

269
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:33,780
yes yes and I rely on my daughter a lot

270
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,730
for feedback and you know and kind of

271
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,770
counseling in a way and she's like dad

272
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,740
if um if you would have gotten the test

273
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,330
before he left the US when you got there

274
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,390
you were to ask Rose hey I want you to

275
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,510
take this STD test because I did oh so

276
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,000
he got an STD test

277
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:51,550
that would have been I think more of the

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,170
appropriate thing to do I kind of get it

279
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,460
like you come from completely different

280
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,830
backgrounds and apparently she didn't

281
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,540
like talking about their past but to

282
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,310
just drop that on someone when you just

283
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,810
met them it's kind of weird it's just

284
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,490
kind of walk uncomfortable and

285
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,590
especially the way you said it whole

286
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,630
thing is so dumb if the true narcissist

287
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,430
can't be fixed I like to believe people

288
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,290
can be fixed I don't like I don't think

289
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,570
anyone is unfixable y'all keep promoting

290
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,630
this creepy old perv what's her side of

291
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,790
the story right right I agree when it

292
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,320
comes to a new woman potentially in your

293
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,180
life finding love

294
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,610
what are you doing differently this time

295
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,100
around I want to hear this just be

296
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,040
honest that's number one no I'm gonna be

297
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,750
honest I'm going to be honest you know

298
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,270
definitely be more tactful it's been oh

299
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,670
my god I've been in in a relationship

300
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,590
and you know I wasn't trying to be

301
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,690
offensive in any way and I and I have

302
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,030
never ever said you know anything

303
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,500
negative oh my god just be honest that's

304
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:51,460
later all you have to say he's learned

305
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:55,420
nothing right guys great be honest that

306
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,410
gap in a run and this this surreal it's

307
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,020
the experience

308
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,790
it cost me you know I don't know you

309
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,180
know three to four months of my life and

310
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:06,670
I shot a thousand dollars you're made a

311
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,340
ton of money off this come on yeah

312
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,770
that's like a cameo I don't know why

313
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,570
people are paying for this but hey it's

314
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,450
your money

315
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:18,040
sixty-six bucks are you serious dude the

316
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,290
amount of times I've been asked to get a

317
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,080
cameo by cameo or other companies it's

318
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,000
like no I'm not [ __ ] doing that

319
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:29,170
twenty-six thousand pounds what is that

320
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,360
that's $33,000 let's say cameo takes 30

321
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,570
percent that's twenty three thousand

322
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,660
well I lost five thousand shut up

323
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:39,940
and that's the best gift that Rose gave

324
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,090
me as I'm ready to fall in love I'm not

325
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,980
afraid anymore okay well that's great I

326
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,690
have yet to see just some sort of

327
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,060
apology I know it's hard for people

328
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,850
who's not used to they start a thing but

329
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,680
just own up to it that's all you have to

330
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,510
do just be like I wasn't honest I wasn't

331
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,250
truthful that was a big mistake on my

332
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,780
part and if anything for an 11 from this

333
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,120
experience is that and

334
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,760
next time I find love that's what I'm

335
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,040
just going to do I know I still have

336
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,930
flaws and but I hope to work for them

337
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,510
and whoever loves me will accept me for

338
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,070
them right am i writing apology for Big

339
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,530
Ed here this is what I'm saying and you

340
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,410
can charge me 66 I'll charge you 66

341
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,000
pounds for it just invoice me I think

342
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,440
most people would feel satisfied with

343
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,630
that but instead it just comes a whole

344
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,090
narrative all the haters all the bullies

345
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,010
and yada yada yada when the Internet is

346
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,810
forgiving as long if she's say they were

347
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,700
heartfully the right thing and what you

348
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,760
mean I gotta say though you know despite

349
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,900
Rose not getting any money and whatever

350
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,930
who cares

351
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,090
I mean it seems unfair but at the same

352
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,710
time she's the one that when a rose

353
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:45,490
above and she was the one that was

354
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:47,800
honest and she didn't act wrong and or

355
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,570
completely out of line in any of this

356
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,970
she still has her integrity and that's

357
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:55,060
worth whatever you know twenty three

358
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,100
thousand bucks or your integrity yeah I

359
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,750
don't know I personally I mean it's easy

360
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,880
for me to say I have money but it I

361
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,370
guess what I'm saying is in my opinion

362
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,140
she came out on top for sure so that's

363
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,480
the whole story I doubt they're gonna

364
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,950
reconnect after all of this it seems

365
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,600
like there's still bad blood between

366
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,060
them but that's the end of the saga

367
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,710
that's the whole aftermath that's it

368
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,910
I'll probably do another TLC in the

369
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,530
future with another couple because

370
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,570
they're really fun for some reasons this

371
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:22,450
stupid drama but still if you enjoyed

372
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:25,060
