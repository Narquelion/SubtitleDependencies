10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,750

[Music]

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:46,860
I got a jump from here we're in the

13
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:49,190
red-crowned woods so this no okay

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,510
this game is popular with streamers

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,520
because streamers are actual man

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,280
children who are not good at games even

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,350
though they play it every single day so

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,890
I thought hey look at that

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:07,560

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,479

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,580
about trajectories I know that's hard

22
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,920
for people to understand simple math and

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,670
trigonometry for me however comes quite

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,670
natural

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:31,880
I think I'll stay down no get up there

26
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,880
