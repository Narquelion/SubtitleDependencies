an anthill which they can live in and

99
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,770

deliver a baby using centrifugal force

172
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:53,450
the regime would spin you until the baby

173
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:59,540
came out and he would be caught in a net

174
00:07:53,450 --> 00:08:02,660

175
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:05,480
patented dammit it was already patented

some unlawful drug buying going on here

196
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,160

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,700
that they're not siblings and they just

205
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,730

206
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,640
