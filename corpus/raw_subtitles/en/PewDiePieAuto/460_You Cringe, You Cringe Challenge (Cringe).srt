00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,170
okay

155
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,350
what if I think you're the worst a lot

156
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,820
of people think you're the worst

157
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,459
bro you honey you had like a 90%

158
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,240
download on the trans video that doesn't

159
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:11,100
mean anything

160
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,870
yeah it sure does what I mean I mean it

161
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,130
means that you had a largely negative

162
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,410
reaction on the video

163
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,200
yeah doesn't mean I'm the worst well

164
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,760
being the worst is kind of an abstract

165
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,709
concept but I think it's a personal

166
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,600
belief that I think the people who smash

167
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:25,460
the dislike button thought you were the

168
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,930
worst

169
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,550
I don't think so I disagree all right

170
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,800
