1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,639
today very special day halflife alex is

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,250
out I can't believe it they did it

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,340
a halflife game after all these years

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,180
that means it's not even fun referencing

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,800
the meme obviously you already know

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,900
half-life 2 one of my favourite games of

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,760
all time and that on the biggest

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,580
cliffhanger of all time

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,070
I got ballbusting cliffhanger and then

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,679
they just didn't make any and here we

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,969
are finally with that not number three

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,940
but half-life Alex at a prequel made for

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,610
VR it seems to me that Valve just I'll

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,190
start playing soon I swear it just seems

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,160
to me like valve and knew that they're

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,660
better off making a really good game

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,920
instead of making a half good game even

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,320
if they will make a lot of money

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,410
nonetheless so the fact that this is out

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,379
now it makes me feel like this is gonna

21
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,390
be a really good game especially since I

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,760
know Val has been into VR for a long

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,309
time and there hasn't been that one VR

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:10,110
game yet out that makes you wanna buy a

25
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,820
head and a VR headset they did not - not

26
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,740
to talk trash on the other VR games

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,960
there are good VR games but it hasn't

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,450
been like that one and I think this

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,009
could be that one I hope I'm right but

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,430
who knows there's only one way to find

31
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,110
out

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,509
let's freaking play this I hear it's

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:31,829
good already so there we go yeah yeah

34
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,200
yeah yeah so this is the prequel as far

35
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,810
as I'm concerned that's all I understand

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,119
that I mentioned have like it is five

37
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:47,759
years before the collapse of Citadel and

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:51,740
the death of Eli Vance 19 she's 19 I was

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,210
thought she was like 26 or something I

40
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,450
I'm not into her anymore I used to like

41
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,320
her ill disgusting oh maybe she's 19 now

42
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,320
of course of course

43
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,979
ayee all right okay

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
have like - is one of my favorite games

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,160
of all time

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,770
I [ __ ] love that game holy Shh

47
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:23,080

00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,490
I haven't even started playing yet look

52
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:52,040
there's stuff happening everywhere it's

53
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:58,490
so detailed I pushed a moon so I can go

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,990

55
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,740

56
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:05,990
Oh what they're flavored my favorite we

57
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,340
got gelatin ated calorie Pacey

58
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:12,550
mmm egg flavor you like some egg flavor

59
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,550
that's funny

60
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:22,040
whoa well done so far this is really

61
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:30,760
cool all right

62
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:30,760
press it Eli's calling it's my bed bang

63
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:53,680
how do they do it if I'm Alex

64
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,590
sorry

65
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:18,340
so they're building the Citadel that's

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:21,310
SoDo I was actually thinking about

67
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:26,130
half-life the story the other day can I

68
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:29,320
draw with these of course I can because

69
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:33,040
if you think about aliens we always

70
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,440
imagine aliens as if if they're going to

71
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,960
attack us there's gonna be some big war

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,570
and they're gonna take us over but the

73
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,940
rule of any war is if you can fight

74
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:48,760
without a battle that's always the most

75
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,170
effective efficient way to do it so it

76
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,820
would make way more sense that they do

77
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,460
what they do in half-life where it which

78
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:57,130
is where they sort of manipulate get

79
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,620
into the politician what am I saying

80
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,820
it's just one immolating leaders into

81
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:05,010
getting what they want instead of

82
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,010
actually having a fight all right

83
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,300
did any of my incoherent rambling make

84
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,180
any sense let me know I just thought it

85
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,860
made I don't know obviously they became

86
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,930
a resistant and all that this is so

87
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,780
amazing oh my god

88
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,930
[Music]

89
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,930
[Applause]

90
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:29,089
so for those of you who are not familiar

91
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:30,439
with half-life you can see they use

92
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:32,719
different sort of alien technology

93
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,659
because they they take the best from

94
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:37,189
other worlds and just steal their

95
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:38,419
technology which makes sense to which is

96
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:39,889
a really cool concept

97
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,360
I forgot what they're cold though I

98
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:49,369
haven't played in a while can I put this

99
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:51,259
on amazing but what I love about

100
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:53,239
half-life is just like it's an adventure

101
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,069
from the start to be beginning I need to

102
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:57,289
stop talking about it I'm sorry it's

103
00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:04,129
just I love it I love it so much now

104
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:06,319
this is so goddamn cool chair that's

105
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:13,219
what I said all right what do we got

106
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:17,259
here this is fun I'm blown away by this

107
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:20,559
I feel like I'm in the game there's I

108
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:26,300
totally forgot I was in VR first second

109
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:31,009
that does not happen out then it's

110
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,059
subtlety that really sells beer very

111
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,969
subtle things

112
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:38,809
see how I mess that up a little bit took

113
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:46,029
