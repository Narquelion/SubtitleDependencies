435
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,639
bit on the side fine

436
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,639
because it's kind of loud too it's kind

437
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,240
of annoying when you hear it that's true

438
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,240
and we need to be able to sleep at night

439
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,839
