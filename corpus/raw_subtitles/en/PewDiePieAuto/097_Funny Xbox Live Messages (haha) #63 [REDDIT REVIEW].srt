censoring toxic language that's the

116
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,819
depletion of fun in video games there's

117
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,029
no point as soon as the term toxic gamer

118
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,620
came to be gaming was over for me it's

119
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:47,409

game ever to just troll people cuz you

could just be the most awful human in

293
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,420
old time there was these messages going

294
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,880
around where people were sending out

295
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,560
pretending to be a game master which

296
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,110
were pretty convincing the way they

297
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,490
phrased it and they basically directed

298
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,960
you to a link that looked like the

299
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,880
official website but it wasn't it was

300
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,850
fishing basically before fishing was

301
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,670
popular and my friend got one of them I

302
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,440
knew it was fake but for some reason me

303
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:50,420
being the worst person of all time I

304
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,140
told him no it's real I don't know why I

305
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,880
did that

306
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:57,830
what's wrong with me so he put and the

307
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,600
next day he lost all these items and he

308
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,950
was so mad at me and I didn't feel

309
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,560
guilty I just thought it was so dumb for

310
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:05,120
falling for it good times that really

311
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,250
takes me back I love the teabagging

312
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,410
games you can't do these things in games

313
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,570
anymore like just take everything you

314
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,370
workdays for there's no games like that

315
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,890
now everything's protected to be safe

316
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,050
all the time am I right or am I wrong

317
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,550
like these things made the game fun I

318
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,770
remember another thing we used to do was

319
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,210
uh you can show off your items in the

320
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,000
game like you can push put them on the

321
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,710
ground to trade them so if you want it

322
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,240
to be cheeky you can like put it down on

323
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,920
the ground like one second I think I've

324
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,230
said this before you can put that like

325
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,190
if you had like a really good armor or

326
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,750
something you could put down on the

327
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,060
ground and then just take it up really

328
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,200
quick and be like ha look at that look

329
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,430
at that you can't do that in World of

330
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,380
Warcraft you can't do that in other

331
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,600
games if you have an item you can't

332
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,760
generally you can't lose it but no not

333
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,620
in this game so what we would do is we'd

334
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,450
be like hey look at this and then would

335
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,610
would mate wait for someone else to do

336
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,300
it as well be like oh yeah well look at

337
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,580
this except we would be ready with like

338
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,900
50 bags of just trash I don't know how

339
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,390
many bags of trash we're just a ton of

340
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,580
trash so as soon as they do it we were

341
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,470
ready to just throw all that trash above

342
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,970
it so that they can't pick it up again

343
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:12,590
so they would have to like scooch

344
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,670
through be like oh god they have to dig

345
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,230
through all this trash to get their

346
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,830
armor back but eventually they will get

347
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,480
back to it

348
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:22,310
we would be ready push them out of the

349
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:24,290
way hmm take their shoes that was fun

350
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:27,230

miss gaming now I understand now why I

403
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:11,020
used to be a gamer it was a moment like

404
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,940
they use you're like a six year old you

405
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,650
have the intellect of a walnut and you

406
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,340
can't be trusted with anything I

407
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:20,080
remember always being so shocked at

408
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,700
people liking my YouTube videos in the

409
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,650
beginning because I was just such an

410
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,900
intolerable in Poehler able person

411
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,440
online that I only experienced with

412
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,550
other people online I was like just

413
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,590
trolling so everyone just hated me

414
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,960
online I would always get in trouble as

415
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:38,140
soon as I got any respectable level in

416
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,490
any video game I would get way too cocky

417
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,560
and they would just bite me in the ass

418
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,410
so I would never get anywhere there's

419
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,200
like old forum posts I remember in tibia

420
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,610

421
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,590

423
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,500
would didn't do anything wrong by the

424
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,300
way I can refute those things if I find

425
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:59,380
them so yeah I was really shocked that

426
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:02,350
