whole day don't tell me I see okay so

132
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:13,989

all the corruption here here here that

134
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:18,129
was very awkward that took a long time

135
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:19,629

136
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:21,429

00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:25,179
comments to say there's a way smarter

139
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:27,699
way to do it but I did it that way and

140
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:29,289
that's the way I do it and now more I

141
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,089
don't have to worry about corruption for

142
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:33,759
