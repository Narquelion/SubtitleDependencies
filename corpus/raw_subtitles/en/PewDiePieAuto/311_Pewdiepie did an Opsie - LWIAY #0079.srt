91
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,530
scientists students need heed I see

92
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,470
where this is going

93
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,910
need a full eight hours of sleep schools

94
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,770
we don't do that here

95
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,220
they need homework you see they can't

96
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:51,300
just do schoolwork at school they need

97
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:54,430
to also do schoolwork at home all

98
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,919
weekends when there's no school oh no no

99
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,210
I went to a Montessori School which is

100
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,880
based on the concept that you're

101
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,940
supposed to study yourself at school

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,530
like we got an hour a day in school for

103
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,960
us to do homework and stuff like that

104
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,909
but that just led to teachers giving us

105
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,590
more homework because we always go hey

106
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,870
there's no time for us to do the

107
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,360
homework and they're like oh is there I

108
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,580
believe that is an hour every day every

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,250
teacher went that so we school sucks

110
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,960
smash like if you think school sucks too

111
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,900
school didn't even teach me how to buy a

112
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,190
Lambo like SM H man PT PI deserves

113
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,550
proper recognition

114
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:32,800
oh that's goddamn right okay 2019 s

115
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,470
YouTube rewind will be worse than 2018 s

116
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,150
why since YouTube will most likely have

117
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:41,590
something related to teasers but not

118
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:43,300
foods that hurts me you guys think of

170
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,840
scam app meaning she'll probably get

171
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,880
terminated

172
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,780

173
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,790
poppin Laurie oh all right well the next

174
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,260
point I guess I have to address this not

175
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,820
a meme but there's a lot of people

176
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,410
commenting on peebs recent video and I

177
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,450
thought I'd send it here - this got

178
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,890
30,000 up votes and it says don't

179
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,530
download NIM says the app it's

180
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:24,720
advertised it takes all of you data and

181
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,210
monitors it even after you install it

182
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,700
now this is just demonstrably false okay

183
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,600
abs can't do that if you aren't in Seoul

184
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,910
it so

185
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,770
it's already spreading misinformation

186
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,470
just in the title literally every single

187
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,780
social media tracks the way nemesis does

188
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,490
it's a social media app everyone seems

189
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,620
so freaked out about it and there was

190
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,680
this this top boat saying that they

191
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,080
broke down the apk like the the file on

192
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,480
Android and it showed what it does and

193
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,400
the really scary part is that they use

194
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,440
the following permissions ordered by

195
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,630
danger from high to low the fact that it

196
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,000
starts itself when the phone powers on

197
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,280
any app that has notifications does this

198
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,860
okay what else it requests install

199
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,620
packages can request the users to

200
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,600
install additional apps and software

201
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,880
literally any app with ads does this we

202
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,560
do it in tuber simulator as well hey you

209
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,940

213
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,090
they're not paying me to defend these

214
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,770
allegations but you're just going off

215
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,200
rumors if you're worried about your

216
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,000
privacy by all means don't sign up to a

217
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,740
social media network I thought it

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,480
sounded like a cool idea if you guys

219
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,220
didn't like the promo and you know like

220
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,990
the sponsorship I'm sorry I mean I will

221
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,450
try to do better to find ads that you

222
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,640

223
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,870

the media stuff and then you're

226
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,580
spreading misinformation to make it look

227
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,770
like I'm promoting a scam

228
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,780
obviously that makes it look way worse

229
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,530
same thing with D live like D live is

230
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,480

231
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,800
there's no proof to show that but it's a

232
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,260
bunch of rumors spread around being like
