1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,950
what is my most controversial video fish

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:15,590
lasagna bridge ah ah nope

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:18,510
it's why I don't like Marvel movies

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,609
let's let's look at this video this is

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,140
the worst dislike ratio I have on any

6
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,970
but not least an infinitely more

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,390
apparently a big deal of the movies that

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,800
a lot of superheroes die but I'm not

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,140
gonna spoiler which once or anything

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:37,050
like that but let's just entertain the

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:39,510
idea that lets say I remind dies let's

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,780
say Iron Man dies from Oliver write that

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,780
down

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:50,219
how good yeah I like how my main

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:55,079
criticism of the Marvel filmed was that

16
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:58,649
no one actually dies I was proven wrong

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,590
to be honest I never watched endgame or

18
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,840
any of the last films and and when I

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,700
flew recently from Japan to UK my

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,640
computer were in charge I had no choice

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,590
but to watch what was offered and it was

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,270
all Avengers of course and which is one

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,000
of the reasons I didn't like Marvel

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,439
because it's literally everywhere

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,509
ironically but I watched it and I

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,610
actually enjoyed it for the first time

27
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,890
please don't dislike this video

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,810
I love Marvel ok this is not the point

29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,450
and I realized the reason why I liked it

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,430
so much was because I finally like one

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,430
of its heroes Thanos

32
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,110
that's right Thanos is epic and also

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,360
very sexy I realize that there's already

34
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:43,180
a hundred videos at least about the

35
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:49,960
philosophy of Banias and why was Stannis

36
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:52,090
right hmm Appalachian Pete well I would

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:56,560
argue that Thanos was actually better

38
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:58,509
than all of us here's why well first of

39
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,220
all what Stan is right to understand

40
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:07,119
that you must understand what is right

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:09,910
if you have glasses on now what is right

42
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,410
think about it why it's such a smug

43
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:16,690
question don't think too hard this is

44
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:22,030
not I'm 14 and this is D I'm waiting

45
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:27,640
right is in most senses and you could

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:29,950
call an ethical system to bring wellness

47
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,959
to something a community or yourself and

48
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,400
sometimes making the right choice will

49
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:43,180
lead to unethical actions like say

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:44,799
wiping off half the universe the

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,070
philosopher søren kierkegaard who I've

52
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:51,160
spoken about before on my channel calls

53
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:54,220
this concept in the book of fear and

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,160
trembling the theological suspension of

55
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,100
the ethical tlo's means goal in in greek

56
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,160
and it's basically means putting aside

57
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:07,510
what is right or what is technically

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:13,150
good to do in hope for something greater

59
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:15,519
if you buy G fuel enter code pity PI to

60
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,760
become ethically energized and and

61
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,430
thirst quench you made a theological

62
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,610
decision Thanos believed that wiping out

63
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,260
half the universe would be would make it

64
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,090
so that life would actually be able to

65
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,549
continue and thrive and become better

66
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,799
and did not just cease to exist I think

67
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,440
that's the consensus I don't really

68
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,170
remember this universe

69
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,840
I annoyed its resources finite his life

70
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:46,540
is left unchecked life who ceased to

71
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:49,570
exist it needs you don't know that I'm

72
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,880
the only one who knows that but his goal

73
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,470
is for things to turn out well and he

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,580
doesn't take pleasure in the killing

75
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,850
which i think is an important

76
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:02,690
distinction of him being good or right

77
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:05,240
[Music]

78
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,490
and that's the important distinction of

79
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,610
why he's likable he's a tragic hero

80
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,990
this makes Tanis what søren kierkegaard

81
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,200
would call a night of infinite

82
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:18,050
resignation and so what is that then

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,910
well Kierkegaard defined life in three

84
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,340
different stages and I spoken about this

85
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:25,000
in my channel before but the first one

86
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,500
where most of us is is in the aesthetic

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,140
we're sort of trapped here we're

88
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,240
focusing purely on our senses we try and

89
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,710
maximize we try and maximize them as

90
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,580
much as possible to feel as good as

91
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,440
possible

92
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,660
we don't live for one single thinking

93
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,300
but many many different things and I

94
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,890
think most people can relate to that we

95
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,960
think these choices based on what will

96
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,270
make us happy so how do you get out of

97
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,970
the aesthetic well you move on to the

98
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,830
ethical and to put it very simple it's

99
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,490
basically living for others or another

100
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,110
purpose beyond your senses and it's here

101
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,820
where the night of internet resignation

102
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,560
can exist just because it's called a

103
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,180
night doesn't mean it has to be a man it

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,360
could be any but I also believe

105
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,530
character garda calls it a night to

106
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,690
symbolize someone very strong and

107
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,570
chivalrous and tough you would have to

108
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,700
be to make these sort of decisions that

109
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,220
a knight of infinite resignation has to

110
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,810
make when character God talks about the

111
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,240
infinite he's talking about what you

112
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,070
love and that is what defines your

113
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,410
entire worldview it quote from the book

114
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,480
is so for the first thing the night will

115
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,970
have power to concentrate the whole

116
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,650
content of life and the whole

117
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,230
significance of reality in one single

118
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,570
wish the night of infinite resignation

119
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:38,930
resigns just that everything for this

120
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:41,870
wish and Diana's did this he put he put

121
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:45,110
everything aside to reach this goal to

122
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,180
reach this wish a hero is typically

123
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,640
defined by what they love

124
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,150
what do you love have you ever made a

125
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,920
decision on something that you sacrifice

126
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,260
for the greater good

127
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,560
maybe you've given up on a dream to

128
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,840
pursue happiness for someone else by

129
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,700
understanding what we love we open up

130
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,200
ourselves to become more vulnerable and

131
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,750
this is something that's very hard to do

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,510
but a night of infinite resignation also

133
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,250
understands that the world is finite the

134
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,350
world doesn't always fall into the right

135
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,570
place sometime

136
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,210
you will not always win there's a limit

137
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:23,150
to each and every one of our capacities

138
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,800
and no matter how hard we try let's say

139
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,550
you have all these mean superheroes who

140
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,900
manages to frickin turn back time to

141
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:37,229
stop you Jesus

142
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:40,259
time travel what

143
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:42,719
I see this is an absolute win say they

144
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,270
didn't snap Thanos back sorry spoilers

145
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:47,509
would Thanos given up giving up at this

146
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,509
point

147
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:02,400
I don't think so and this is what Jackie

148
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:04,710
God calls for when you reach your your

149
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,170
capacity of your limit you must then

150
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,540
turn inward and here you can keep your

151
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:12,990
love he says as as young as the day you

152
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,030
had it and and it lives on spiritually

153
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:19,440
infinite this of course would be very

154
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:21,840
painful but you can reconcile in its

155
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,310
spiritually infinite existence I think

156
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,800
it's really interesting with character I

157
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,950
said he himself gave up his love omit

158
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,460
him his life Regine Olsen to pursue his

159
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:34,230
writing at another sacrifice and I think

160
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,810
that's probably why he came up with this

161
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,130
whole theory idea but that I think

162
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,440
that's what makes him so interesting

163
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,570
because he truly lived his ideas I

164
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,640
criticize character guard in a previous

165
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,640
video because he explained everything

166
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,680
previously in this book either-or with

167
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,970
such perfect rationale for hundreds of

168
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,710
pages and when he talks about the

169
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,750
aesthetic and when he talks about the

170
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,600
ethic but when he talked about the

171
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,010
third-stage the religion rationale was

172
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,410
just completely thrown out the window

173
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,690
and and to me whenever discussing

174
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,940
religion it has always just seemed to me

175
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,410
like blind acceptance and blind

176
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,040
following and it seemed like he wanted

177
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,630
you to do the same thing but it's clear

178
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,220
that I didn't understand character guard

179
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,590
because that's not what he wanted at all

180
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,110
if anything he was strongly against that

181
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,700
he was strongly against blinded

182
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,770
acceptance it's part of the reason why

183
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,020
he criticized Christianity at the time

184
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,090
because people had just accepted

185
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,410
becoming Christians and it wasn't

186
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,600
something that he thought people

187
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,479
actually practiced even if you're not

188
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,339
religious you still probably blindly

189
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,870
accept a lot of ideas that's not to say

190
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,060
that everyone religious blindly accept

191
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,700
ideas but you understand what I mean we

192
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,500
protect ourselves from ideas because

193
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,260
because some of them would change our

194
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,420
worldview if we accepted them some ideas

195
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,220
will never fully get pondered and

196
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,350
therefore we will never find our

197
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,270
infinite is it a coincidence that is

198
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,450
called Marvel infinity war I don't think

199
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,550
so

200
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:03,690
this whole connection with Marvel is so

201
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:06,590
cringy but I tricked you into watch a

202
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:12,500
listening philosophy epically

203
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:14,060
you know my final message is this and

204
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,900
it's the same as character cards you

205
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,910
have to practice your ideas you can't

206
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,720
just buy a ninja sky into how to become

207
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:26,690
a pro gamer and then become a pro gamer

208
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,430
you must practice I'm 14 and this is

209
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,589
PewDiePie I hope you guys enjoyed this

I really enjoyed character gods fear and

212
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,310
trembling it's a great book I kind of

213
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:40,040
feel like I've jumped a bit back and

214
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:42,080
forth too much with philosophies so but

215
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,339
it's something that I enjoy reading and

216
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,150
something I enjoy sharing so I hope you

217
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:49,220
