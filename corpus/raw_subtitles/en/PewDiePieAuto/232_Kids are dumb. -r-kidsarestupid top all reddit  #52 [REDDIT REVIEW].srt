Felix thank you

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,910
actually I've been traveling for a few

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,389
days now I'm in Canada and I'll be back

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,610

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,289

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,060
still enjoy this video just wanted to

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,470
clarify why there's been the same I

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,029
actually really for coming back and

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,470
working on Minecraft and stuff like that

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,289
but until then Johnny

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,640
bye-bye okay kids describe color to a

13
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:35,550
blind person of you ever saw a color of

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,930
a blueberry I've never seen anything

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,510
ever that's the whole point

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,610
kids are freaking stupid what's up

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,010
gamers it's time to fully understand

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,170
just how stupid kids are and not only

19
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,520
are they stupid they are also weak I

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,680
challenge any child to a fight today we

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,079
are reviewing kids are freaking stupid

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,170
I'm wearing glasses so I'm probably

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,030
twice as smart as a child by default

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,220
when I was six I named my animal

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,409
crossing character sex and couldn't

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,140
change it back so panicked went outside

27
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,920
the next day and smashed the game card

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,549
with a head I have lived with this my

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,460
whole life

30
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,580
oh god how do I delete it I must destroy

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,140
the evidence right now get the hammer I

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,720
can just imagine like a rainy night

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,520
Thunder take out your animal crossing'

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,159
cartridge and you smash it to the ground

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:46,680
because no one can know this is one of

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:50,009
the best clips of all coding so much

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,229
chaos in ten seconds this stuff every

38
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,520
face in this is absolutely ten out of

39
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,520
ten it's so good

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,200
this clip is one of the greatest clips

41
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,970
online I have this theory and I've been

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,670
talking about this for a long time and

43
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,710
if you follow me as well you know all

44
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,780
right I think it's time for me to start

45
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:21,410
getting my opinions out there because I

46
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,500
am going for president in 2020 and my

47
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,270
idea is basically picture Hunger Games

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,620
but you can't just have a bunch of

49
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,200
people there that's immoral and

50
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,720
unethical just have kids instead have

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,060
kids every child that way you never have

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,250
to see a child that way only the good

53
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,010
children will survive and will create a

54
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,770
society of strong people I realized this

55
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,210
comes across as a little too generous

56
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,700
kids are great I love kids they're

57
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:49,420
awesome I just remember it that when I

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,670
got my first dog I was seven and he was

59
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,530
1/7 in dog years and I cried when he

60
00:02:52,670 --> 00:03:02,090
turned 2 because I didn't think a

61
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:04,280
14-year old dog oh no my dog is too cool

62
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,740
to be with me now I'm trying to think

63
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,959
what stupid ideas I had as a child but I

64
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,690
can't think of any I was just I was just

65
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,000
big brain since the womb I mean I yes I

66
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,970
did think the action mang figurine came

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,880
with a real-life surfboard and harpoon

68
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,670
okay that's not my fault that's false

69
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,200
advertising yes I thought that action

70
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,989
meant police uniform came with the

71
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,000
police uniform is that so crazy and a

72
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:31,700
dog with an epic leash

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,050
I got light too it's not my fault I was

74
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,360
failed as a child

75
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:41,480
keep your toddler busy by letting them

76
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:44,239
paint the fence with me so good oh I

77
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,620
take back my idea by valuing I I want I

78
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,690
want to have my own kid so I can

79
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,550
terrorize it by doing these things oh my

80
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,250
god I look forward to this so much this

81
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:55,190
reminds me my parents would always force

82
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,080
me to shovel snow outside our staircase

83
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,459
we had a staircase outside a house it

84
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,130
wasn't our staircase it was the public

85
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,450
staircase but my mom was like oh if we

86
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,730
don't shovel the snow and an old lady

87
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,100
falls and dies then we can go to jail

88
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,870
because we're liable and I'm like oh god

89
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,000
I have to shovel the snow because I

90
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,349
don't want those to go to prison stupid

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,400
old ladies

92
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:19,009
I was tricked I was tricked to shovel

93
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,959

94
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,160

95
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,030
want to hear when my brother was like

100
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:47,120
work overnight last night and while

101
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,610

have a picture and I have detained the

103
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,740
two suspects but one is not cooperating

104
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,949
the only one who can speak blames it on

105
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,060
the foreleg suspect wears no hands to

106
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,759
pull such a stunt

107
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,590
thanks to my neighbor for pointing out

108
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,780
that I have a marker all over my face

109
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:08,030
when I took the four-legged suspect for

110
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,430
a walk before I realized that I was

111
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,860
vandalized well it seems like kids one

112
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,840

114
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,720
daughter didn't want son scream so I put

115
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:25,880

118
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,030
whole carrot meme write that if you eat

119
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,820
a carrot you can see well in the dark

120
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,770
but I never ate the carrots anyway so it

121
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,590
doesn't matter oh my god now I remember

122
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,930
oh god it's all coming to me I love

123
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,849
chicken as a child so a way my mom would

124
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,220
make me eat food was she would tell me

125
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,930
everything is chicken I was like oh what

126
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,639
is this meat and my mom is like oh it's

127
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,050
chicken you love chicken right but he

128
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,159
got to a point where she just said

129
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,020
everything was chicken

130
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,400
I remember pointing at an onion and I

131
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,139
was like mom what is this I don't like

132
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,030
this this tastes bad and she my mom was

133
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:04,120
like no that's a chicken I'm like

134
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,069
no it isn't and that's when I realize

135
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,830
parents are freaking liars

136
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:12,250
same with Santa Claus goddamn it's

137
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,599
unethical to lie to children I feel like

138
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,159
there's so many things that you were

139
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,110
like that has there ever been

140
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:18,849
I'm curious has ever been anything you

141
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,710
were taught as a child and you just

142
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,970
don't question it for like 10 years and

143
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,250
then you're and then you're about to

144
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,419
tell someone something I'm like actually

145
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:30,220
that onion is a chicken and then you

146
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:32,710
realize oh god it's unethical to lie to

147
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,720
children my sister just had a baby she

148
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,729
brought in her home today and my other

149
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,250
niece was so pissed she packed up all

150
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:42,849
her stuff and tried to leave fine

151
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,860
go just go everyone has stories of them

152
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:47,169
running away right everyone has a story

153
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,630
oh I ran away and no one noticed so I

154
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,789
came back never ran away because I'm f

155
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,919
ik I'm smarter than that I know I would

156
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:55,780
die bedtime was half an hour ago my

157
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,069
six-year-old just walked out bleary-eyed

158
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,569
asked his father if a duck is a predator

159
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,789
some things are too important to go to

160
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:05,199
bed without knowing that's fair

161
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:08,380
you know at least I can appreciate a

162
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:13,599
child that question things incompetent

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:16,060

only took me to one soccer game I

166
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,599
remember it very clearly that no one is

167
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:24,400
scored the entire match no one made it

168
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:28,180
and it made a point until the end and

169
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,310
everyone stood up including me except my

170
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,409
dad and my dad looked at me and with

171
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,810
disappointment and said that was the

172
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:36,849
other team that scored Felix and after

173
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:41,710

causing of three-year-olds meltdown this

184
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,900
morning banana to small

185
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,599
bananas slightly squashed honey on

186
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,569
porridge doesn't sufficiently resemble a

187
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:24,870
swimming-pool sister had her first we

188
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:27,270
before his third doesn't want scooter

189
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:30,300
does want scooter something to do with

190
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,159
sleeps okay this is it when the kids are

191
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,810
acting like this they've gone too far

192
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,959
and you need to send them to the island

193
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,849
it needs a better name maybe like Darwin

194
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,800
Island that's where they all fight it

195
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,570
out they'll be like a Call of Duty

196
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,880
basically there will be kill streaks

197
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,300
when you beat all the children you get

198
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,450
the choice of either continuing or go

199
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,980
back to society and I think a pretty

200
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,769
good anime can be based around the

201
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,410
concept as well so if anyone wants to if

202
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:01,380
I have any anime makers watching this

203
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,480
feel free to contact me oh my god he has

204
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,730
been very very picky lately

205
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,459
but loves Taco Bell so I made a homemade

206
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,959
meal and put it into a Taco Bell bag and

207
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,220
it actually worked

208
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,100
I would never fall for this

209
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,350
simple-minded treachery toddler daddy I

210
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,370
want toast me okay buddy here's some

211
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,170
toast toddler

212
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,270
I don't like butter on my toast flip

213
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,089
toast over to the dry side and hence it

214
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,670
back there you go toddler thanks daddy

215
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,709
yeah if you let your toddler control you

216
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,540
then I'm sorry you need to be sent to

217
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,640
the island as well oh that's a good idea

218
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,459
write that down that's a really good

219
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,339
idea what's the most recent illogical

220
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:39,990
breakdown your toddler had he loved

221
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,930
being tickled so I was tickling him one

222
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,060
day he let out a huge fart and suddenly

223
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,190
started crying and screaming I asked him

224
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:51,480
why he's screaming and he replies with I

225
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:53,490
was saving that for later all right we

226
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,740
need a separate island for really smart

227
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:59,010
gifted children to make sure that these

228
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,829
kids can thrive in an environment where

229
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,770
society doesn't break it down for them

230
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:07,470
okay how dare you question why they were

231
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:10,949
saving apart don't say you want a Lego

232
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:16,860
tower building contest if you can't have

233
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:19,410
a Lowe's egg Oh kids are so dumb you

234
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,470
feeble child you thought you could beat

235
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,779
me in lego building contest I will beat

236
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,290
you in any challenges hmm I'll let you

237
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,330
pick the category

238
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,430
I remember the first time you looked at

239
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,860
porn online it was so confusing because

240
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,360
you knew your pants knew what sites you

241
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,980
access you didn't know how they knew

242
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,960
what size you went on so it was

243
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,850
terrifying to like go to a porn website

244
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,380
so once you did I remember I went

245
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,080
through Pamela Anderson calm or

246
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,780
something like that and I was like I

247
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,820
need to savor this I already explained

248
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,380
this sir but now I already gotten far

249
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,140
enough in it I don't know how my parents

250
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,240
can know this so I need to savor this

251
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,400
the fact that I'm going on break ingush

252
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,130
barrier by going to this website so I

253
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,220
need to savor it so I printed the photos

254
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,260
like the genius I am I'm like oh this

255
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,510
way I don't have to keep going back to

256
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,390
this website and risk getting caught but

257
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,760
then I had a genius epiphany that that's

258
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,100
not a good idea that as tangible

259
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,110
evidence okay I should just cancel these

260
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,280
prints and I cancelled the prints and

261
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,110
went on with my day

262
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,870
to summarize the story they still

263
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,670
printed at a later time when my dad was

264
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,520
at the printer and he showed me the

265
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,350
pictures and it was epic I'm becoming an

266
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,350
actual boomer like saying the same

267
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,260
stories twice now my son trying to get

268
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:38,440
back down from washing his hands just

269
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:41,560
hang in there helpless so I decided to

270
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,020
take a photo and humiliate him online

271
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,110
this is good parenting and I appreciate

272
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,970
it I walk out a target to the scene of a

273
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,680
child laying motionless on the ground I

274
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,950
asked what was wrong and it had said

275
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,670
he's upset his gloves match his jacket

276
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,740
that's awesome

277
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,690
the child should be stupid send him to

278
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,530
the ranch Oh we'll call it the ranch

279
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,660
that makes sense

280
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,190
one time my uncle put a wig on my

281
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:08,350
cousin's head and told him it was

282
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:10,180
permanent yes

283
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,370
lions can hunt and kill their own food

284
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,930
by the time they're three months old my

285
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,270
three year old couldn't find her

286
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,820
lunchbox and it was in her other hand

287
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,670
this is what I mean if evolution is real

288
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,100
then why are kids so dumb this is why we

289
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:27,280
need the ranch okay you don't understand

290
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,550
my society if you vote for me we'll be a

291
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,230
prosperous nation it will be a

292
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:34,420
semi-autonomous state and the ranch can

293
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,540
bring up a lot of revenue if we turn it

294
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,250
into an anime I'm just saying

295
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,010
opens bottle of bleach nephew

296
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,140
how did you open it I tried but it

297
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,900
didn't open oh it's because it has a

298
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,170
child safety a lot children can't open

299
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,690
it

300
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,160
nephew looks at bottling amazement how

301
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,680
did it know I was a child

302
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,290
it's that bottle of programmed how can

303
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,700
bottle know what is the dumbest thing

304
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,680
you believed as a child I thought

305
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,980
Michael Jackson has to stop whatever

306
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,800
he's doing and sing when I play his CD

307
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,020
as a result I never played it at night

308
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,940
to give him some family time that is

309
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,180
actually nice and wholesome that's so

310
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,370
nice wait CDs are kind of old though how

311
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,870
old were the person who made this bet

312
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,620
you kids don't know what I catch that

313
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:22,690
player is God I'm an actual boomer this

314
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,820
kid asked me for some skittles but I had

315
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:28,060
just finished them so he stared at me

316
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:31,690
like this didn't I how can you do this

317
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,880
but why why you eat them all I would

318
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,530
just say yeah just let me finish them

319
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,720
first and eat them slowly in front of

320
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,340
him mom I just wanted to tell you that

321
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,400
Mother's date wouldn't be possible

322
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:45,240
without me I'll be waiting for my

323
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,820
present in the living room love Joshua

324
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,100
Joshua is a child with great potential

325
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,960
and he will not go to the ranch he will

326
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,890
go to the special school of gifted

327
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,350
people Joshua another gifted child I see

328
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:01,270
my first grade students were asked to

329
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:06,370
write letters to the local nursing home

330
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:08,740
and times almost up why is there such a

331
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,930
difference between the gifted chat seat

332
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,230
my theory is perfect this is gonna go

333
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,339
great

334
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,470
he made iron man out of costume this

335
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:21,339
would be my reaction either way if I met

336
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:23,260
him I used to think this movie was

337
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:26,200
live-action and the people who lived in

338
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,150
Europe look like this this is true all

339
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,530
Europeans look like that I'm actually

340
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,960
CGI

341
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,480
I'm always a little annoyed with parents

342
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,490
when kids are really scared of dogs is

343
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,960
that it's a weird thing to say but if

344
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,520
I'm wrong feel free to tell me but I'm

345
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,370
always like dude have you not taught

346
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,080
your child my dogs are safe like at

347
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,300
least my pugs I don't know it's like

348
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,790
Edgar comes up to a child and they're

349
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,160
like I don't like Jesus Christ teach

350
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,760
your kid how to interact with dogs it

351
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,050
ain't that hard

352
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,880
I still see adults

353
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,470
getting scared of dogs I mean I don't

354
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,750
want to shame people if they have fears

355
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:02,890
that's fine but it's just weird like

356
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:05,140
Edgar ran after him lady one time and

357
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,930
she started screaming like an adult

358
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,959
woman started screaming in genuine fear

359
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,760
out of Edgar the Swedish looking area

360
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,680
come here I feel like I need to show

361
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,620
just how stupid this dog looks so you

362
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:23,320
understand if this dog comes after you

363
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:27,940
like how can you be scared and I was
