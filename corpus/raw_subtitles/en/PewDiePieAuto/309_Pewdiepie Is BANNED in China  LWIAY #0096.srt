music artist zed got bad in china just

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
because he

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,559
liked the south park tweet so obviously

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,640
me talking about the hong kong memes

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,040

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,120
i stumble upon this thanks to joel and

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:59,470
it's the most confusing thing

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:09,939
i have ever seen

27
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:09,939

30
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,360
i like that he changes his own english

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,600
to just fit the chinese market so

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,360
bart baker for those who don't know bart

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,680
baker this is beautiful

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,600
this is the best thing i've seen ever i

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,240
saw this and i'm like this has to be a

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,720
joke

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
but it's so obviously not a joke bart

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,439
baker

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,119
uh has 10 million subscribers on youtube

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,479
he's done a parody of

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,920
practically everything i'm not going to

42
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,200
play his songs because it'll get

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,520
copyrighted but

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,119
you know he's collaborated with stevo

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,200
joey graceffa

46
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,240
his parodies are not bad it's not my

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,920
type of humor but

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,920
some of them are actually good i'll give

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,570
him that bartbaker's channel has

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,560

i am obsessed as one could ever

57
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
now bart records himself with face

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,720
filters

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
translating chinese songs into english

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,360
she can sing

61
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,640
but check this out that seems to be a

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,640
winning formula for bart

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:51,840
okay that guy's voice is awesome but

64
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:54,000
check this out

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,840
notice how he keeps changing the side of

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,680
the microphone that's the correct way of

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,440
the microphone i have the same one but

68
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,580
i guess he realized it looks cooler if

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,360
you hold the microphone the wrong way

70
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,560
[Laughter]

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,319
i don't know why i'm pointing that out

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,599
but that's like the least embarrassing

73
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,920
thing out of all of this

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,920

year term or higher

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,080

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,400
pay millions to the company

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,230

delusional superstar

that's how you know you truly love china

121
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:11,840
if you have a huawei

122
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,840
nothing to do with sponsorships

123
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,919
i see you tomorrow or maybe i'll see you

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,600

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,000

126
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,000
what what was that sentence

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,280
jesus jesus

128
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
this is satire because if it is it's so

129
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,800
brilliant

130
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,680
it's genius bart was a classic youtube

131
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,160
success story

132
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,960
his specialty was parody music videos

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,520
imitating pop stars like taylor swift

134
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,199
and justin bieber he'd get tens of

135
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,320
millions of hits on his most popular

136
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,199
videos

137
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,520
right some of bart's most popular songs

138
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,479
have 200 million views like if he got a

139
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,280
sponsor in that

140
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,800
that would be a lot of money i assume he

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,479
doesn't get those numbers anymore and

142
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,639
that's why he turned to this

143
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,080
but a couple years ago youtube started

144
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,919
dropping channels that weren't family

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,400
friendly from their preferred program

146
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,280
in order to attract advertisers is this

147
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,960
my fault bart

148
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,680
i'm sorry suddenly big name youtubers

149
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,600
like bart

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,880
saw the revenue drop to a fraction of

151
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,639
what it used to be

152
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,720
i don't think that's necessarily the

153
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,840
issue the issue is that now

154
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,800
short videos are not as monetizable as

155
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,479
longer ones

156
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,160
youtube youtube changed in 2016 was it

157
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,160
that they want more watch time instead

158
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,720
of views so content that

159
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,440
that gets a lot of numbers and isn't as

160
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,360
valuable

161
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,880
as longer videos that's just how it is

162
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,880
music videos aren't long

163
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,240
they don't make many much money it's

164
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,800
like lasagna

165
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
has like 200 million views but it's

166
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,319
probably

167
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,000
made less money than this video and it

168
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,400
used to be fine on youtube

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,440
actually like the more edgy it was the

170
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,639
better

171
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,639
fast forward a year and a half maybe and

172
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,319
you know i'm like super miserable uh

173
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,840
going to a therapist

174
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,919
because youtube yeah yeah you don't know

175
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,039
how many youtubers are depressed

176
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,800
if bart is happier doing uh chinese

177
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,360
content i'm happy for him don't get me

178
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
wrong

179
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,280
like i get it youtube is very stressful

180
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,639
if you're not on top of what you're

181
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,440
doing you're done and that's just the

182
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,759
reality of the

183
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,960
of being a youtuber and that puts a lot

184
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,199
of pressure on you so

185
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,360
so anyway all this [ __ ] was going on and

186
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,840
i was super unhappy and i get an email

187
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
and it's like um

188
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,120
we're a company from china we think you

189
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,120
could be very big in china

190
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,319

they said that the first thing they do

217
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,000
is look at how you look

much of the success

229
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,360
what is he talking about can be

230
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,399
attributed to the fact that you're white

231
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,720
a small amount to start a good amount to

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,480
bart explained that

237
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,959
they came to him because they saw

238
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,680

this guy i can make him a hit here um

he's so mean
