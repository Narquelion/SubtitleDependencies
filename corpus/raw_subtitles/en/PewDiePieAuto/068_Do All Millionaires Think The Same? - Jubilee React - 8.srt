1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,509
do all millionaires think the same today

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,900
we find out a millionaire

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:13,349
I can answer finally we're doing a you

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,210
believe spectrum spectrum yes which

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,310
means I get to play along and you can

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,800
silently judge me how about that

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,779
self-made has to be somebody that was

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,699
growing up broke I disagree with that

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,230
you can mow lawns for a few months and

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,490
make like a few thousand dollars we know

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,960
how many lawns I'm gonna have tomorrow

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,969
it's a lot of lawns once they say once

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,680
Matalan lot of my limes

14
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,260
that's right poor people you're not

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,690
mowing enough lawns I keep telling you

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,379
guys you gotta get Mon lowing what are

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:47,160
you doing

18
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:49,559
cringe Sykes the key to my success is

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,539
just working hard like 18 to 20 hour

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,190
days every day of my life and having no

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,270
life but having a lot of money alright I

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,489
don't care who they are I'm sorry

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,559
they're all six millionaires with

24
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,090
different values and beliefs I am

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,739
self-made hold up hold up hold up

26
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,750
strongly agree somewhat again okay I

27
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,920
would put myself I agree

28
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,040
[Music]

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,810
okay so 72% agree growing up I didn't

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,280
need anyone in my family that was it was

31
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,990
in real estate I didn't have anyone of

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,180
my family that you know had millions of

33
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,470
dollars and for me I'd blame properties

34
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,250
for something fifteen six years I

35
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,140
haven't twenty bucks

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,909
and working part-time after school and

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,780
like saving away all that money then I

38
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,720
used that money to get my real estate

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,700
license I barely graduated high school I

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,560
never went to college

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,750
two divorced parents so I should not

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,659
have become wealth that's right if your

43
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,189
parents divorce you got no chance I know

44
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,950
he's just listing a couple things I get

45
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,150
it but still that sounded kind of dumb

46
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,700
sure you can list things that would make

47
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,189
it easier for you I don't know see

48
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,460
statistically what I believe that I put

49
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:53,100
in them no one's the sickest no one

50
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,930
statistically is going to make it

51
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,880
statistically most people don't I

52
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,259
literally started from the bottom I'm

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,850
not saying that I was ever homeless or

54
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,040
anything but I did grow up in a

55
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,110
single-family house hold everyone's odds

56
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,420
are stacked against you shut up

57
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,080
administration my counselor told me I

58
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,300
would never make it in business so it's

59
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,850
self-pitying to go like I should not

60
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,650
have been successful guys

61
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:19,350
everything was against me I just had to

62
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,570
am i being crude maybe a little bit I

63
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,990
just generally think people becoming

64
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,520
rich is such a fluke that I don't that

65
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,700
doesn't mean they didn't work for it but

66
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,670
it's so much luck involved in it so to

67
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,430
act it's like somewhat self-important or

68
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,000
about it it just I don't know I feel

69
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,890
weird about it

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,500
I'm somebody that was growing up broke

71
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,540
in my opinion like you got it from the

72
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,460
bottom and I didn't get it from the

73
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,470
bottom I just grew that I don't think no

74
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,760
I agree with her actually I totally

75
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,140
agree with a you need to come from

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,580
straight from the bottom like I started

77
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,290
with a few thousand dollars I know a lot

78
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,150
of people who started I got a small loan

79
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,090
of a million dollars it was very tough

80
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,100
for me what do you mean up thousand

81
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,570
that's a ton like if you had nothing at

82
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:08,700
that was a dollar so that's a huge

83
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:10,620
advantage are you kidding me yes yes it

84
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,620
matters like your life like you can't

85
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,240
the zero but let's say you start with a

86
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,770
thousand dollars I still believe

87
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,120
yourself maybe even ten thousand even

88
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,430
twenty thousand because you're not truly

89
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,170
like a even six figures or seven figures

90
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,820
I'm broke and I live at Mom's house with

91
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,700
zero dollars you're in a way better you

92
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,680
can vote yes you are oh my god does he

93
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,239
not see it you can mold lines here at

94
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,440
every few months it makes like a few

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,760
thousand dollars like there's we know

96
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,620
how many lawns I'm gonna have tomorrow

97
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,980
it's a lot of lawns but that is

98
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,480
self-made the point was hot how much do

99
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,340
you feel like you're self-made and if

100
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,280
you start off with money given to you

101
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,410
that's that's obviously an advantage I

102
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,790
would have been better off if I had

103
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:56,820
money in the beginning that would help

104
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:58,890
tremendously oh oh all right let's see

105
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,660
where I would put myself I would put

106
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,120
somewhat agree maybe it's a piss people

107
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,000
off I don't know I I just remember being

108
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,220
it the the reason some ways is for a

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,799
short time it was a short time I was

110
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,940
very very poor and I was too proud to

111
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,130
ask my parents for money and I could

112
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,600
barely afford buying food I'm sure most

113
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,489
people gone through this at some point

114
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,470
in their life worth you can't really

115
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,479
afford food you just buy I remember just

116
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,070
buying pasta and just living that off

117
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,660
for a month and I would eat it plain

118
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,850
with some spices and that was

119
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,410
because I was all I could afford but it

120
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,970
wasn't a long time period in my life

121
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:43,950
it's not like I grew up being poor or

122
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:46,500
whatever did they just they did they

123
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,070
just high five not being poor let me see

124
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:54,450
that again

125
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:55,770
yeah not being poor gang man being poor

126
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,750
and being broke I've been broke before

127
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,060
like me my husband I've been broke many

128
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,370
times in like our relationship but we've

129
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,780
never been poor and even like a long

130
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,850
time ago when I lived in a one-bedroom

131
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,710
apartment with my family we were never

132
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,720
poor I mean I was happy like I had

133
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,000
pudding we went to like parks and stuff

134
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,190
I never felt poor damn she had pudding

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,140
all I had was spaghetti you don't

136
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,460
understand my struggles well I got

137
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,560
kicked out and moved into my

138
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,230
grandparents garage and so I was poor

139
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,700
mentally and I was broke financially and

140
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,340
I had to take care of myself at a very

141
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,200
young age so for a decade I was running

142
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,660
a pool company in order to eventually

143
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,160
gain the opportunities to ultimately

144
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,690
move that ball down the court obviously

145
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,060
so but were you happy I mean I wasn't

146
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:41,610
what the hell why are you happy he said

147
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,770
he was poor financially or mentally as

148
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,390
well like not really right because there

149
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,160
was a lot of stuff going on and like I'm

150
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,740
living in a garage and I'm growing up

151
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,500
and I had to not only he didn't have

152
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,980
pudding I think that's the issue here no

153
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,080
pudding I had to bust my ass off to help

154
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,910
my mom so for me I feel like we all

155
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,800
start from somewhere we go through

156
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,020
certain motions because it builds

157
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,700
character I like that I'm jealous of you

158
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,169
guys I wish I had that mindset like I

159
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,150
traveled to third world countries to

160
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,610
kind of this guy wish he could mow lawns

161
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,730
that's really it I grew up really really

162
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:17,760
great but then I hit 20 and I moved out

163
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:20,040
with some boy in the situation got very

164
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,110
very domestic violence you know I was

165
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,400
living in a penthouse and I'm sorry I

166
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,500
got too much pride I wasn't gonna go

167
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,510
back home and you know I'm like black

168
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,730
and blue like getting locked in like

169
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,820
closets like really really toxic stuff

170
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,800
so that for me was very very poor now

171
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,060
did it sling I mean that's obviously

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,729
awful but what does that have to do with

173
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,650
being poor I'm so confused shot me too

174
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:43,259
six-figure a month income

175
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,180
yes but in that state of mind and in

176
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,210
that environment I felt like I was

177
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,250
really poor like I looked beat-up and my

178
00:06:48,210 --> 00:07:12,680
direct deposit was not gonna fix a black

179
00:06:50,250 --> 00:07:12,680
eye you know like oh no no oh god I

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,919
don't want to pay more taxes god damn I

181
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,900
look so red what is happening I need to

182
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,150
stop shooting so late at night what the

183
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,800
hell I look insane dude there must be

184
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,720
something going on here why is it so

185
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,030
dark there's no way there must be

186
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,229
something on my camera settings all

187
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,770
right guys this is how it looks night

188
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,870
now

189
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:38,720
I'm sorry guys I'll get it fixed next

190
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:44,130
video oh thank god oh thank god I

191
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,810
thought I would be the only ones oh no

192
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,630
like you know you make more money you

193
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:52,470
obviously do have to pay somewhat more

194
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,840
no feel like we deserve extra things to

195
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,360
pay just because we have more money like

196
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,639
we shouldn't be looked to as like a fun

197
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,930
you know from the government or someone

198
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,639
else who just feels like oh you have

199
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,780
more money you should pay more in taxes

200
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,610
I just feel like it should be a little

201
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,199
bit more freedom with it cuz it's really

202
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,690
really stressful and I feel like a lot

203
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,580
of businesses fail in the first three

204
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,780
years because a tax is not because

205
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,490
they're bad at business not because

206
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,530
they're about it managing money but

207
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,680
because they're not prepared to do

208
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,760
everything by the book true true I don't

209
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,880
mind paying taxes

210
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,310
obviously obviously I just wish I knew

211
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,080
where they were going big companies who

212
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,120
sell a lot of their services like in the

213
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,310
US and then they have some like Ireland

214
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,320
tax status where they're getting out of

215
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,029
it like Apple and Amazon and these big

216
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,640
companies that theoretically should pay

217
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:39,930
billions in taxes while it's us average

218
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,430
people who are really supporting the

219
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,349
government I think there should be a

220
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,420
little Aboriginal people and they are

221
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:46,920
average average men British people

222
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,810
millionaire I see what he's trying to

223
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,339
say though cuz everyone likes to pick on

224
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,870
millionaires and be like more taxes when

225
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,150
in reality these huge companies are

226
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,980
avoiding so much but they

227
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,360
supplying jobs they are supplying a

228
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,310
service I don't know

229
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,920
Amazon paid zero dollars in taxes didn't

230
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,430
didn't Amazon save that because they cut

231
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,900
on on the on bosses they got a tax break

232
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,950
or something like that I don't know

233
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,450
enough about these things

234
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,340
I just know people like to throw out

235
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,820
lines for that knowing the new ones just

236
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,560

sell on Amazon so through Amazon FBA

248
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,459
he's provided an opportunity for people

249
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:52,259
like me to make a living for myself to

250
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,180
be able to start a business you know

253
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,269
like whether we think that he needs to

254
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:08,420
give more or not I mean that's really up

255
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:11,250
to him what he does with his money I

256
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,899
would put disagree I think the most

257
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,410
expensive thing I own is my car and

258
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:20,430
that's just like 60,000 just 60,000

259
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,470
listen to me I guess I own properties I

260
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,139
just don't like having things it makes

261
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,810
me feel overwhelmed I'm just like no

262
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:29,579
stop no more thank you I realize how

263
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,290
spoiler I sound but if you were in my

264
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:44,009
shoes you would understand is really

265
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:46,500
tough getting free stuff all the time my

266
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:48,569
husband my husband is like 90 grand car

267
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,889
and added like a 200 grand car I'm like

268
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:51,149
why did you do that like you don't need

269
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:53,490
you don't need to he's like well I mean

270
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,529
I could so why not like I don't want to

271
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,810
pay more in taxes but I don't have to

272
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,230
pay buy more cars but I just did I just

273
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,069
do

274
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,870
I don't want to pay more taxes I mean I

275
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:06,000
grew up wanting cars like I my whole

276
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,959
bedroom was like plastered with cars on

277
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,420
the wall and then when I could actually

278
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,829
buy it it was like it's so fine right I

279
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,389
was fulfilling a childhood dream it

280
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:15,149
wasn't even about the car it was the

281
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:17,939
challenge yes I had all the cars the

282
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:20,069
thrill was gone so I mean it Hey look at

283
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:21,959
that he understands he's learning money

284
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:24,600
just bites you materialistic goods they

285
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:27,449
just either satisfies a craving or a

286
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:32,430
momentarily spark of joy that will fade

287
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:34,290
true happiness we think oh no I think

288
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,430
that you should all have like dreams and

289
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,170
chase those dreams whatever they are

290
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,750
maybe they don't cost that much but I

291
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:42,029
mean not everything's materialistic like

292
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,390
when I started making money yeah I

293
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,310
changed my body yeah I know I mean

294
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,800
I wouldn't cleared my skin yeah I

295
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,970
wouldn't got a tattoo what I would not

296
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,890
like you know what I mean like yeah

297
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,100
don't get hair extensions like I've

298
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,570
definitely purchased things in the past

299
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,700
that were cool and it was because I

300
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,100
could but as times gone along for me

301
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,019
I've realized so many times that every

302
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,940
time I hit the goal or the destination

303
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,399
of the target I realized that the

304
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,320
journey was so much more fun and and as

305
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,870
I've achieved more success and built

306
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,519
more companies it's almost every time

307
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,620
now where I get there and I'm like man

308
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,399
the journey was actually funner than the

309
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,110
destination yeah right

310
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,060
yeah cause like yeah but the question

311
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,089
was if you've spent an absurd amount of

312
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,790
money just because you can not me mm-hmm

313
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:31,920
I used to buy a lot of bags I'm like no

314
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,019
I like and then once I got there it was

315
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,540
kind of like I don't have a man I don't

316
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,190
kids what am i doing

317
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,720
but the question wasn't like what do you

318
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:44,540
think about what's not don't make me

319
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,620
agree with you mr. TED talks if you do

320
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,430
what do you think about material

321
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,680
possessions now like true but in the

322
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,959
past I've had that so I fulfilled my

323
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:59,790
childhood dreams now I'm good these are

324
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,050
the same questions that's before oh yes

325
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,350
not in person

326
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,910
I don't know I think I've I think a lot

327
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,980
of times it just makes me sad for other

328
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,600
people that the point I'm about to make

329
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,060
is that people look at me and they're

330
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,220
like oh he doesn't have any problems

331
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,050
because he has money people jet so many

332
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,399
people share the idea that if money

333
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,660
solves all your problems and I know I

334
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,959
talk about this a lot and every time

335
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,550
everyone gets mad at me I just feel bad

336
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,920
for people that I have bad mindset

337
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,690
because I know for a fact it isn't true

338
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,610
stop thinking money solves all your

339
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,130
problems because it just doesn't it

340
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,529
doesn't sometimes I look back on the pad

341
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,019
times when I was just starting off

342
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,130
YouTube and I was just making enough to

343
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,130
pay my rent

344
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:43,560
each month and that's the kind of time I

345
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,730
look look at almost back as the most

346
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,220
happiest when me and my dad were in

347
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,550
Sweden we we didn't have a lot of money

348
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,740
it wasn't like easy but we were equally

349
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,720
happy then the amount of Fame and

350
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,240
success that I got it was it has been a

351
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,020
huge package and obviously you know

352
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,810
money

353
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,810
I just I prefer to have it obviously but

354
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,030
okay we got some split 93% agree live in

355
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,490
a world where social media is extremely

356
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:14,410
prevalent so like being on youtuber or

357
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,180
Instagram or social media a lot of it's

358
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,880
like perceived you know you are

359
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,560
constantly getting like quote-unquote

360
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,150
judged but even on social media it

361
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,830
really just depends what you post if

362
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,290
that's very much just to control them

363
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,640
just for social media like I an even if

364
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,110
you ask me what time it is I check my

365
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,120
iPhone I don't even know if this thing

366
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,860
works but like when you're trying to

367
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,540
grow your business especially for me

368
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,760
like in stock trading why do you get

369
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,430
into stock trading is it fun no it sucks

370
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,690
but you can make money so for social

371
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,880
media and you kind of have to show it

372
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,220
but even with social media I mean if you

373
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,830
have a million subscribers on YouTube I

374
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,540
think you're rich yeah because I know

375
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,570
YouTube is writing you a check

376
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,980
oh so you judge people know something's

377
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,080
keeping your lights on now I'm not

378
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,330
judging in a bad way of course you know

379
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,270
I I work every day to try to make videos

380
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:06,940
too but in the same sense like we judge

381
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:08,920
people that ask us for money let's see

382
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,440
the Normie filter all normies will say

383
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,610
yes here's the thing obviously money can

384
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,590
buy happiness you can buy you things

385
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,530
that you like it can buy you good health

386
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,710
you can buy a lot of things obviously

387
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,300
obvious

388
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:25,650
I'm just saying true happiness comes

389
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:28,000
from here I strongly believe that

390
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,620
it's kind of like that poor broker

391
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,660
mentality it's like you trick yourself

392
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,490
to think that you're happy you trick

393
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,140
yourself that you want these things so

394
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,300
that's why they say yes I guarantee it

395
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,640
all over again like if you're rich and

396
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,190
you're like in a domestic violence

397
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,350
relationship we all love the idea then

398
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,360
and it's even what I touched on before

399
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,490
we like everyone loves the idea that

400
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,800
only if you know only if I was rich then

401
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,120
all my promises it's like a fantasy that

402
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,040
people like to play with it's like the

403
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,410
lottery huh you can buy that idea

404
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,150
literally that's what that is you buy

405
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,860
the mindset oh ah what would I do with

406
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:03,070
this money you know oh all these things

407
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,510
and you have statistics and actual

408
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,550
studies showing that people that win the

409
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,410
lottery end up more miserable because

410
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,730
their whole life got changed and in a

411
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,430
lot of ways my life got changed

412
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,440
completely due to YouTube and not I

413
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,880
would say always positive like you're

414
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,190
not happy even though you might have

415
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,200
money but still money can buy fun things

416
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,970
and looking back like you're proud of

417
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,560
your accomplishments you're proud of the

418
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,630
journey that you took to get to where

419
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,580
you are and in a way it can pass money

420
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,530
allows you to buy freedom and then

421
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,760
freedom gets you the ability to have

422
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,710
more time to find what makes you happy

423
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,240
it's not a direct result but it could be

424
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,490
like let's say your mom or your dad or

425
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,620
somebody that had a severe illness you

426
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,300
know was in the hospital and they had X

427
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,340
amount of time to live now this person

428
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,840
makes you extremely happy and it's gonna

429
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,220
cost a million dollars or two million

430
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,930
dollars for this surgery that they save

431
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,950
them to survive and you save them like

432
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,540
you quite literally just bought

433
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,430
happiness now that's not to say that it

434
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,070
buys happiness in every area of life

435
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,960
like I can but in certain areas like

436
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,400
yeah money definitely can buy a my most

437
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,170
fulfilling asset is the house that I

438
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,820
bought my parents since I am so grateful

439
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,560
to be able to you were serving another

440
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,180
person hundred percent exactly happy

441
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,790
here's what this guy is gonna say we all

442
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,100
find that I guess reason at different

443
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:14,530
points in our life so I'm I don't care

444
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:17,440
you're boring seriously I don't hear the

445
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,540
same people telling us so annoying what

446
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,730
did she say I I didn't not a single word

447
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,290
and it really just depends on your

448
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,290
definition of happiness what makes you

449
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,970
happy and we all find that I guess no no

450
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,610
no there's no your definition of

451
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,900
happiness that is not exist these in at

452
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,030
different points in our life some people

453
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,470
figure it out really early on and some

454
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,880
people it takes them all a lifetime to

455
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,050
find out what's what makes them happy so

456
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,150
even though you could have a lot of

457
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,980
money if you don't know guys if you want

458
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,750
to be rich subscribe and become floor

459
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,240
gang today it that's how it works

460
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,510
instantly I gotta say though people that

461
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,280
aren't rich they love to sell their idea

462
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,930
kind of what I touched on before it's

463
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,610
like the lottery let's sell this idea

464
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,890
that you can become rich too when in

465
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:00,200
reality a lot of it just comes down to

466
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:02,480
to pure luck and it did for me

467
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,190
especially with timing I think that's

468
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,080
probably my most humbling thing is that

469
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,660
we know what if I started YouTube now

470
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,790
would have been some as successful no I

471
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,320
don't think so obviously you still have

472
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,030
to put in the hours and I think a lot of

473
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,400
people judge people that are successful

474
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,260
too and basically looking at them back

475
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,080
oh if I put up the same amount of hours

476
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,700
to work I would do it too and that's not

477
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,920
really the case either but right rich

478
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,650
people love to sell this idea to people

479
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,600
too so they can feel like they have some

480
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,360
sort of control over their life like

481
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,380
okay you know there's so many

482
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,360
autobiographies of rich people or or

483
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,580
online programs you know the Jake Paul

484
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,170
program you can be rich too right if I

485
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,230
wake up every morning and if I meditate

486
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:44,000
and if I could do a jog and if I have

487
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,410
these same routine as these successful

488
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,360
people have then it will happen to you

489
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,740
too as well but it's just selling the

490
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,720
idea that you're in control of your

491
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:54,230
destiny when unfortunately you're not

492
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,450
the thing is if you're happy then you

493
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,160
don't need to be rich and being rich

494
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,020
will not make you happy something to
