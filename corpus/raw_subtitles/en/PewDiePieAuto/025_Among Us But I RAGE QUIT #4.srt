vpn

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,760
of public wi-fi

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,720
what did i do i slapped on nordvpn and i

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,400
could browse

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,879
safely but also unrestricted a vpn

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,000
helps you become epic that's how it

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,280
works right now

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
there's a 68 discount really they pick

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,200
68

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,400
no other number all right you get one

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,800
additional month for free you heard this

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,560
i'm saying it again and you love it so

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
make sure you use the code pewdiepie i

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,519
highly recommend using nordvpn i use it

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,599
myself

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,640
and every time i get to use that it's

73
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,800
like

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,480
i'm so glad i had it it's one of those

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
services oh something's blocked on the

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,080
internet

77
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,840
bam nordvpn you're done oh i'm browsing

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,280
public wi-fi this isn't safe

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,319
bam nordvpn i'm done it's there it also

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,480
works on your mobile

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,920
but here's even more there they also

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,040
have nord pass

83
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,680
which is a app that lets you store

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,159
passwords and also come up with more

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,080
better epic passwords i know floor gang

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,159
2020 is an epic password

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,159
but everyone's gonna guess it all right

88
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,319
you need safer passwords

89
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,000
brute force my dude have you heard of it

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,440
they're gonna hack you in two seconds

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
they're gonna hack you faster than you

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,640
can say enter code pewdiepie nordvpn get

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,200
68

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,239
off a two-year plan that's how fast

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,360
they're going to hack you unless you

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,519
have a good password

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,560
so make sure you have saved passwords

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,080
and use nord

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,200
pass you need these services trust me

172
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,720

not gonna kill me

176
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,199

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,479
me

178
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,800
i think i don't think she'll do it for

179
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,800
the meme

180
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,880
oh my god i'm so confused

181
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,319
what is this game okay so i've been

182
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,560
sticking with lily this entire game

183
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,680
and then i don't know why she accused me

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
out of nowhere

185
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,520
so i thought for sure it was lily and

186
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,400
then lily died but the corpse i coaxed

187
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,919
that

188
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,560
cool you just have to take my word for

189
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,160
it i understand it's a tough plea

190
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,120
but that's the truth right lily made

191
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
this so hard for me

192
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,759
right i walked down all the way around i

193
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,440
checked electrical and when i walked in

194
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
felix was standing over her body you saw

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,160
me and reported it oh

196
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,680
that's pretty hard accusation yes i i

197
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,639
honestly hope it's toast at this point

198
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,840
just pitting everybody

199
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,560
against everybody else yeah i could

200
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,520
saw him in o2 there's no possible way it

201
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,280
could have been anyone else they

202
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,800
couldn't even have vented out unless

203
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,560
toast went all the way around the top

204
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,919
felix is that what happened did he see

205
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,280

212
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,399
when he's detective but when he's

213
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,159
imposter he gets a lot quieter

214
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,680

326
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,399
three that went to the top

327
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,880
right because i wanted to bang out the

328
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,720
