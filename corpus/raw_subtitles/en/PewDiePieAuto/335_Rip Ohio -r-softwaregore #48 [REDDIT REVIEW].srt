00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,390
were a kid and he would get a new phone

33
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,860
and there wasn't that much to do on

34
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,290
phones back in the day so you were just

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,090
trying find like every little thing

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,650
about the phone like going through the

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,990
settings is this relatable because I

38
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,250
used to do this that's why this person

39
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,470

48
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,969
my god cringe this is Apple software

49
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,250
everyone knows Apple users are for dingy

50
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,409
stinky brainers oh my god is it going

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,640
down

52
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:15,080
I mean to be fair oh yeah why would

53
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,450
anyone do this stop this is literally me

54
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,060

57
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,480
the probe dang it

58
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,200
but why reason for not being approved

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,610
your license was a problem yeah what I

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,590
don't understand it there's something

61
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,440
funny about the absolute thumb freakery

62
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,930
about this law my bank just called me

63
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,910
because you can give your accounts

64
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,709
nicknames to remember which saving

65
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,290
account is which okay that makes sense

66
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:48,680
I put an emoji in one of them and

67
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:53,299
apparently somehow broke their entire

68
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,010
Bank existed so I guess don't do that

69
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:57,349
excuse me sir can you stop putting

70
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,120
emojis I do this a lot actually it's

71
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:01,069
really funny to see especially when

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,269
there's text-to-speech and see what

73
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:05,120

74
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:08,060

165
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,030
the highest one and and sometimes it's

166
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,620
really embarrassing because they'll come
