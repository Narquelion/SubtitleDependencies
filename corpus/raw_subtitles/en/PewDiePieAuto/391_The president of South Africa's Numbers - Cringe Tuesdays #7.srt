eight point two hundred if anyone knows

67
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,510
what that means let me know I really

68
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,250
like these news clips because they have

69
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,260
a translator and they just don't know

70
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,260
how to translate his ineptitude

71
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,810
[Applause]

72
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:55,830
megawatts this guy is talking about nope

73
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,660
you know it's no coincidence that

74
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:04,180
they're Doomsday Clock is what how close

75
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,690
is it it's two minutes that's fine

76
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:10,030
doesn't matter maybe just maybe we need

77
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:27,280
to be more careful with who we vote for

78
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:36,910
in our democracies Wow

79
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:39,550
where did he get that number that's a

80
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:45,700
great statistics vicaroo by two hundred

81
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:48,639
and three thousand apples I think it

82
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,490
couldn't handle figure between seven to

83
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,740
eight hundred this continent is the

84
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:59,770
Asian continent in the world not

85
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,080
separated even by a river

86
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,660
the rivers that are there flow with the

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,760
continent they don't cut it how can you

88
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:12,310
have a Potter all continents put

89
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,520
together will fit in into Africa

90
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:18,820
oh wow fun fact

91
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,370
fun fact time all the continents fit

92
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,320
into Africa you know he's not wrong he's

93
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,930
not just the master of numbers he's also

94
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,750
a master of the fun facts all continents

95
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,090
fit into Africa as you can tell here

96
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,880
this is one of those illusions where it

97
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:38,500
like it wouldn't work but if you try it

98
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:41,229
you can see it clearly like USA has so

99
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,699
much space North America has so much

100
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:48,400
space left in Africa and if you take

101
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:52,120
Europe there's plenty of space from

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,040
Europe as well if you cut it out it yes

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,010
you can tell here it all fits into

104
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:01,449
Africa all right this guy is a president

105
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:06,729

impact that other people are affected by

120
