trick

87
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,740
that's impossible there's no way I could

88
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,110

89
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,880

I'm so confused so first trick is called

97
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,890
the first step of the trick is to get

98
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,479
the yo-yo spinning and then once we

99
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,830
activate the door gang we gotta get the

100
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,600
yo-yo swinging a little back and forth

101
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,550
action if you know I'm saying remember

102
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,800

103
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:45,470

spinning our finger what to that now if

111
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,360
you're having trouble in wearing pants

112
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,650
that are way too tight like me one thing

113
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,390
that you can do is instead of throwing

114
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,010
the yo-yo in front of you like bodies do

115
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,990
today a little bit harder to catch in

116
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,910
your pocket what you can do is throw the

117
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,720
yo-yo so it's sideways in front of you

118
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:52,160
then when you go to launch it up you're

119
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,530
gonna have a much easier time catching

120
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,200
