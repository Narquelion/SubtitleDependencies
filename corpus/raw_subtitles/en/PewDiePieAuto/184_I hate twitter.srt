1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,440
I hate Twitter I think about deleting

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,270
mine all the time what I don't like is

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,890
that constant posturing that goes on

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,330
there people just can't seem to help

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,370
themselves from pointing out what is

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,740
good and what is bad or how others are

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,420
bad and you are good to a point where it

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,250
almost becomes fiction just to satisfy

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,039
this need and I don't mind that this

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,020
happens I understand that it does but

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,760
what annoys me most about it is that it

12
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,580
gets rewarded through social media we

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,949
get likes we get engagement by boasting

14
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,019
about certain things it's very popular

15
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,239
a classic example could be JK Rowling

16
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,430
changing the sexual identity

17
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,800
retroactively Leon our characters as a

18
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,960
way to posture for social virtue points

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,360
this to me is a good example because

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,730
most understand that it's complete

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,280
[ __ ] but it's not always easy to

22
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,190
tell what is genuine online contrasting

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,629
this using sports as an example

24
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:54,149
previously we have for thousands of

25
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,820
years rewarded the winners the people

26
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,949
who act the ones who run the fastest

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,430
swim the fastest score the most goals

28
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,369
etc etc we don't reward the ones who say

29
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,869
they run the fastest but thanks to

30
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,030
social media this is someone become

31
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,770
backwards you get rewarded for saying

32
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,890
things that make you seem virtuous

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,049
rather than acting on it obviously this

34
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,640
is not nearly to the same extent but it

35
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,430
explains why the site has become such a

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,869
cesspool of opinion and how more often

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,970
than not the people who boast about

38
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,189
being virtuous often reveals to be

39
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,630
hiding the fact that through action they

40
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,000
are not I feel like there's so many

41
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,920
youtubers that could call out but what

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,920
is virtue then and what makes someone

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,930
actually virtuous well luckily this is

44
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,420
answered by ancient Greek philosopher

45
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,460
Aristotle according to Aristotle the

46
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,710
path that leads to virtue is also the

47
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,780
path that leads to happiness or a happy

48
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,909
life I find it kind of humorous with the

49
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,649
neverending self-help books that exists

50
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,680
that still tries to answer this question

51
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,630
today when it was answered over 2,000

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,630
years ago by the ancient Greek word

53
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,549
eudaimonia what does this mean keep

54
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,920
watching we'll explore please watch

55
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,020
first I just want to say I think it's so

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,549
[ __ ] cool the more I study ancient

57
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,340
Greek philosophy the more I'm just

58
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,500
amazed by it first we had Socrates one

59
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,540
of the arguably greatest philosophers of

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,090
all time who taught using that word

61
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,340
loosely

62
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,250
by the way Plato my favorite philosopher

63
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,560
an amazing writer and Plato then created

64
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,140
his famous school the Academy which iris

65
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,030
tatl then enrolled in and Aristotle has

66
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,670
been described as the great the one

67
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,950
philosopher I mean what a lineage but

68
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,739
wait it goes on Aristotle also taught

69
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,569
Alexander the [ __ ] great I didn't

70
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,400
know this how insane is this the guy

71
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,349
that took over the [ __ ] world anyhow

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,180
in the book Nicomachean ethics by

73
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:42,730
Aristotle it wasn't actually written by

74
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,950
Aristotle it's notes taken down from his

75
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,780
lectures by his son Nicky mcian some

76
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,120
argue this is the most important work of

77
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,370
philosophy ever written and in it we get

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,799
the answer what is virtue according to

79
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,750
Aristotle virtue is habit what this

80
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,760
means is that it can't be taught

81
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,220
you can't teach someone how to be a good

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,900
person or how to act the right way

83
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,060
instead it's something that comes

84
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,129
through practice one good act doesn't

85
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,120
make you a virtuous person instead it's

86
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:09,760
something that you have to keep

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,739
practicing through action and through

88
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,360
habit can achieve after reading this I

89
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,940
find myself looking at my own upbringing

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,799
and how habit has shaped Who I am

91
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,109
I never realized us how much of my whole

92
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,560
life and my whole being is based on

93
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:25,569
habit my moral my choices all of this if

94
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,700
you strip down this idea of right action

95
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,980
through habit you could compare it to

96
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,170
machine learning or self taught AI which

97
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,970
actually works similar to how a human

98
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,459
brain functions and learns just in a

99
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,099
massively simplified way for example if

100
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,440
a self-taught AI wants to learn how to

101
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:44,230
walk they need a motivating factor for

102
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,329
that to happen it could be moving from

103
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,220
point A to B in the shortest amount of

104
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,650
time and that's the function that they

105
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,540
need to maximize when it learns it tries

106
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,400
different behaviors many times over and

107
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,290
over until it finds the most satisfying

108
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,450
path which achieves that function

109
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,849
basically developing habits of behavior

110
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,660
to achieve their goal so then looking at

111
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,910
as humans

112
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,590
what is our motivating function what is

113
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,269
it that drives us every day to get out

114
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,700
of bed and the answer according to

115
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:12,130
Aristotle is happiness happiness is the

116
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,510
root function for all our actions if you

117
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,419
make an example out of this you could

118
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,979
say what if you want $100,000 what would

119
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:20,169
you do with that amount if you say you

120
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:22,539
want to buy something materialistic like

121
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:24,969
a car you can then ask again well why do

122
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:26,620
you want a car you may answer Oh to get

123
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:28,060
from point A to point B

124
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,639
well why do you want to go from point A

125
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,889
to point B you may answer to achieve a

126
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,600
certain goal and why do you want to

127
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,850
achieve a certain goal well

128
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,620
achieving goals makes you happy

129
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,810
similarly if you said well I want to

130
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,880
save my money because I hope in the

131
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,040
future that it will make you happy so

132
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,199
then if happiness is our function then

133
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,270
why aren't we all happy why is it so

134
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,290
difficult well it's complicated and

135
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,479
difficult to achieve

136
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,160
since virtue is achieved through action

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,570
and habit helps us guide us through

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,220
those actions

139
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,620
iris Tata points out that there's an

140
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,690
excess and efficiency to each of our

141
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,700
actions he describes this with a couple

142
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,340
different examples which I think is kind

143
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,020
of funny because his goal is to describe

144
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,520
what makes someone virtuous but when I

145
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,500
read it it just made me think of how

146
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,000
many ways you can fail as a human if

147
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,680
you're too scared of something then

148
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,660
you're a coward but if you're too

149
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,340
fearless then you're overconfident

150
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,010
iris taught will put a lot of emphasis

151
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,630
on communication if you get offended by

152
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,880
humor too much then that makes you

153
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,130
boring if you make too many jokes then

154
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,350
you are seen as unserious if you're too

155
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,180
sad you're depressed if you are not sad

156
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,030
enough you might seem cold or unbothered

157
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,740
about certain things he lists out many

158
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,630
of these examples on how to fail as a

159
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,150
human but he points out that between

160
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,669
each of these examples there lies the

161
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,650
golden mean no not the golden mean the

162
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,110
golden mean it's here that the virtuous

163
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,150
person acts each time and through habit

164
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,340
only can you find this mean in each

165
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,500
situation you find yourself in but he

166
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,720
also puts emphasis on the capacity of

167
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,610
each person some of us can only act

168
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,400
within a certain frame based on who we

169
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,260
are for example say you see a fire in a

170
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,630
building happen and you run in to save

171
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,760
someone which is seen as brave and

172
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,099
virtuous but if you're not strong enough

173
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,810
to act on this you could get trapped in

174
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,580
the house along with the person and then

175
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,070
causing more harm you should therefore

176
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,260
understand your capacity to act and then

177
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,330
in instead call the fire department as a

178
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,610
way to help and through that way you act

179
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,169
virtuous within your own capacity this

180
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,419
leads us back to the word eudaimonia

181
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,039
which technically translates to

182
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:29,680
happiness and it's a state of well-being

183
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,050
that you achieve by finding the golden

184
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,030
mean through right action and through

185
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,039
habit but what the word really means

186
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,169
isn't happiness it's more human

187
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,790
flourishing for many of us there exists

188
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:42,310
a gap between what we perceive

189
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,410
selves being capable of and what we have

190
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,510
actually achieved and this gap creates

191
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,400
anxiety for us for some there might even

192
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,500
be the opposite situation where you are

193
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,870

196
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,690
would just be another extreme to the

197
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,580
mean but rather is acting virtuous

198
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,980
because you enjoy being virtuous and

199
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,810
it's realizing your potential and acting

200
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,420
upon it that is the key to happiness

201
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:10,750
that is the key to eudaimonia and that

202
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:14,130
is my summary of Nicomachean ethics by
