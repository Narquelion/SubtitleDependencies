can Jesus swim if he walks on the water

184
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:21,390
or is he like stuck on top of it or is

185
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,709
it like in Minecraft when you have frost

186
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,430
Walker on your boots

187
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:29,010
can you jump in or is it only if you

188
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,620
walk straight out I'm sure it will say

189
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,160
in the Vatican storm the Vatican

190
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,860
archives

191
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
it's literally easy ok first entered the

192
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,970
Vatican through the museum's entrance

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,070
nearly acceptable to anyone normos can

194
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,130
go there I bet there's people there

195
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,760
right now get in the hotel del belvedere

196
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:50,850
still accessible s prick get into the

197
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,250
archives nearby might need a trick like

198
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,380
six slightly armed guards up I'm

199
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,860
disappointed that sentence ended with up

200
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,779
but you know either way break into the

201
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,670
secret part of the archives nobody

202
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:05,760
probably is in there maybe the Pope

203
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,070
naked final boss maybe Jesus Christ

204
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,750
himself who knows that's the point we

205
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,880
don't know Europeans

206
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,880
open secret vault in the Vatican Jesus

207
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:25,260
just think about all the epic armor you

208
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:28,620
can imagine pulling out fully stacked

209
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,410
with crosses and that'd be freaking epic

210
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,140

211
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,930
hand grenade and a freaking happy grade

212

when I break into the Vatican archives

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,899
to free Jesus see that's a thing this is

214
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:44,279
