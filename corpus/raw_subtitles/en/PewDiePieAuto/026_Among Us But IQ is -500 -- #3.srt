me and corpse were at the top one and he

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
going on though

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
he really thought it was felix he was

142
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,440
doing some very suspicious movements

143
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
and uh that's why i was following him

144
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,400
around but tell me more

145
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400

i literally said hey voice will vouch

147
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,800
for me because i was literally within

148
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,120

i was gonna say it's felix i was

182
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,039

running up every time no matter what

188
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,479
possibly him

189
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,160
he's so tough to read and try yeah i i

190
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,840
saw chris and julian julian went

191
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,199
into a room and went straight back out

192
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
of comms and i didn't see him do

193
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,520
anything in there

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,520
he did run by me and could have killed

195
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,639
me but three times sean

196
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,400
we passed each other in that bottom

197
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,440
hallway like three different times uh we

198
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,680
didn't high five

199
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,720
any of those times that's your fault i

200
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,880
have a handout i mean

201
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,759
i have zero lead other than possibly

202
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,160
chris so

203
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,680
i was in electrical doing uh some tasks

204
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,960
and then i went up back to med bay to

205
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
finish my feed

206
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,199
so who called the meeting again i did i

207
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,039
thought i was instinct was felix i had

208
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
it all planned out but it definitely it

209
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,560
is not now

210
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,280
i think it's fun because we have to vote

211
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,120
somebody

212
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,639
on the topic okay i came from the top

213
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,319
left and he would have i mean

214
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,080
i i feel like that's if you're that's

215
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,520
all you're you're only leading

216
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,720
down below you said you said you were

217
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,759
doing tasks what tasks were you doing

218
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,800
down below

219
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,000
me yeah i was doing the download

220
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,400
it's gonna touch oh [ __ ] it's gonna talk

221
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,759
oh oh we're dead we're so freaking dead

222
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,000
it's probably chris and julian unless

223
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,800
charlie's being a big brain

224
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,800
julian like um oh i could have done med

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
in front of everyone

226
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,560
wait you only need to kill one person

227
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,479
and we lose right yes yes i believe so

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,840
something like that so the reason i

229
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,680
think it's crazy is because i came from

230
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,759
the top left the body was in the

231
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,039
bottom middle and if i came from top

232
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,159
left he would have had to have come from

233
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,000
middle so he would have passed the

234
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,360
southern to go to the bottom left

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,120
but it's interesting that you're the one

236
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,880
who uh reported it

237
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,399
because i i didn't see it i'm voting

238
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,279
sean honestly oh

239
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,399
yeah it's chris and julian yeah i think

240
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,920
it's chris and julian

241
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,360
it's possible it's not chris like they

242
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,480
could have immediately killed the body

243
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,040
right before i walked in

244
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,160
but i highest probability i would say

245
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,700
chris what though and they both voted me

246
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,920
yeah i don't know about that

247
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,440
[Music]

248
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,000
get out of here chris tinker

249
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,720
we all stayed out of fear of dying but

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
julian was the only one who left

251
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,680
left i have tasked to do what do you

252
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,040
mean yeah we're nowhere near to getting

253
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,880
our tasks done man

254
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,720
yeah we're not do you guys not care

255
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,800
about tasks i don't

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,880
not at this point is it a jack or julian

257
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,880
i

258
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,730
[Laughter]

259
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,839
yes good luck have fun good luck

260
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,160
uh

261
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,800
should i report him can you hear me oh

262
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,120
no okay

263
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
so the first whole half of that round i

264
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,399
saw ethan and dave together pretty much

265
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,680
the whole time on cam so i was watching

266
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,519
security cam

267
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,200
yeah oh okay with dave and i did my

268
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,440
sample thing and then i left because

269
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,800
the time was going down to be fair ethan

270
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,600
and i did asteroids together and he

271
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,959
could have killed me

272
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,480
and it seems like he did it and the

273
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,760
battle went up after he did it well

274
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,200
let's just ask him ethan

275
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,200
deadass did you kill dave

276
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,629
[Music]

277
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,240
where did you find it i was literally

278
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,079
gonna say the last one i saw was you

279
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,120
but uh was me or was julian julian

280
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,600
electrical oh i did see an electrical

281
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,720
yeah

282
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,399
that's true i saw a storage going

283
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,040
towards electrical did anyone else see

284
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,959
corpse

285
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,160
i was i was around him a while he was

286
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,959
his movement was a little weird but he

287
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,640
was also definitely

288
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,560
so nervous what the [ __ ] was happening i

289
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,040
was just doing tasks yes i was doing the

290
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
wires

291
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,320
i'm in the most southern room next to

292
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,160
admin i believe at the moment

293
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,920
where's the box i don't know what to

294
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,320
believe it's an electrical

295
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,920
ethan ethan when did you part with dave

296
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,440
like when in that round

297
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,000
when i killed him pretty early on

298
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,640
like i went to i went and did medical

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
first

300
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,600
and that's when i was with dave and then

301
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,839
i went and did asteroids yeah what did

302
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,839
we do we got to make a choice

303
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,880
i think it's so obvious when it's me and

304
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,040
then i get nervous and then it goes to

305
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,360
my head

306
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,640

literally clearing you to my channel

342

i don't think it's jack uh so it's felix

343
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,399
because i was in the [ __ ] cafeteria

344
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,839

351
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,120

427
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,759
i was just walking with um dave and

428
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,240
everyone

429
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,920
right we were all together yeah i saw

430
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,560
kristen i saw chris and felix at the

431
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,279
oxygen in

432
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,959
admin yeah grease ball i saw you go into

433
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,839
the admin so that checks out that you

434
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,720
just found the body rather than

435
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,640
self-report

436
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,919
unless it's a really quick killing who

437
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,439
were you with last round

438
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,160
in o2 charlie i forgot john ethan and i

439
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,919
at o2

440
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,160
i will say i thought it was ethan

441
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,640
because sean and i came in to o2

442
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,400
from the top and i didn't see ethan get

443
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,559
he said the body was on the right

444
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,919
but since he doesn't check out anymore i

445
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,839
think it might be sean because he's

446
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,760
he's really quiet he's never this quiet

447
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,880
no i'm quiet because every time i yell

448
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,840
everyone thinks that i'm [ __ ]

449
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,840
suspicious so i just

450
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,440
there's two killers so we're literally

451
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,919
yeah dave you could actually saw

452
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,240

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,880

457
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,600

458
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,480

464
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
charlie might have self-reported and it

465
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,919

486
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,240
i just saw charlie kill someone in bent

487
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,440
someone

488
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,280
what's wait where you saw him vent

489
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,640

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,760
nav and then i went down to shields i

491
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,080
don't even know where the [ __ ] body

492
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
is

493
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,840
that's pretty good wait corpse where is

494
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,960
the body it's in the cockpit you took

495
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,080
the bend at the top i'm

496
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,840

497
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
shadows but it was i it was blue for

498
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,640
sure

499
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,280
i i'm pretty sure so it's charlie or a

500
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,880
corpse

501
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,559
i think i might know the other killer as

502
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,000
well i'll put my light white

503
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,840
killer um i saw sean doing the

504
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,039
card task and he walked away before the

505
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,039
green bar went up at all

506
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,720
he did so david i'd say

507
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,799
david for like a bit and i was with

508
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,320
david i was scared to leave admin

509
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,919
because i thought sean was just camping

510
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,160
by the door to kill me and i just made

511
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,600
her

512
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,039
no i didn't leave because i wanted to

513
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,720
make sure ethan did it and it took him

514
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,520
all day and nothing happened until the

515
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,679
body was crazy

516
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,840
like i said no green bar can we go for

517
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,520
charlie corpse then sure

518
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,840
i'm gonna go with sean on this one i

519
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,440
haven't seen though i don't know what to

520
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,640
say about corpse but that with sean

521
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,640
seems a little fishy

522
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,919
hard to see be voting for sean to make

523
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,159
it ask

524
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,120
yeah well um also dave could have killed

525
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,960
me and he didn't just

526
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,240
i literally saw him jump in a vend why

527
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
are you guys hesitating

528
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,520
it doesn't tell us i say sean then

529
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,320
corpse

530
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,679
any last words shown you're that

531
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,679
determined that it's me

532
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,840
jesus christ yeah you really think it's

533
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,840

534
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
row

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,970
[Applause]

536
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,190
let's go feel like you're not muted

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,720
killing time

538
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,720
[Laughter]

539
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,000
this is sub-optimal positioning for me

540
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,400
i are you [ __ ] serious this [ __ ]

541
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:57,440

543
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,960
to him every time

544
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,960
so do we do

545
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,520
no one was going for the oxygen i had to

546
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,520
get both of them

547
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,799

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,480
i didn't go to do desk because i was

551
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,200

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
on the oxygen times to die yeah i didn't

554
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,679
know that so you're looking pretty

555
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
suspicious

556
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,960

ethan says he was chasing me i found him

610
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,320
i found the body what were you doing

611
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,120
there where was that

612
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,640
it was by reactor um corpse and i did

613
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,000
the reactor because like the

614
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,080
someone i guess made it uh and then i

615
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,840
found stinky's body in the hallway

616
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,760
we did react to it walked outside and

617
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,120
his body was in the hallway

618
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,880
with me no he wasn't felix ethan was

619
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,440
chasing you he was chasing me

620
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,080
into the thing where everyone was and

621
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,159
then he said

622
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,679
he was like oh everyone's here was

623
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,240
anyone with sean because so

624
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,039
he died on his way to reactor it seems i

625
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,039
saw

626
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,039
felix around electrical with me when i

627
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,159
was running up to reactor it's possible

628
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,080
it could have been him

629
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,000
ethan was behind me how would it have

630
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,080
been me he was chasing me

631
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,039
i saw you on electrical right so yeah

632
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,559
because if you were coming out of

633
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,520
electrical and i was running towards

634
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,520
reactor

635
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,559
and then the reactor was fine and so

636
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,559
then i turned around

637
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,919
to go back up towards cafeteria and

638
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,840
that's why i was following you through

639
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,039
there i feel like if anything we could

640
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,440
vouch for each other

641
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,720
because we were completely alone and now

642
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,360
there was killers there's there's two

643
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,039
killers

644
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,640
and there's okay you're cool ethan yeah

645
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,799
yeah i like that yeah julian's being

646
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,200
quiet again

647
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,960
where were you i was at the the bottom

648
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,559
where the oxygen on the right side

649
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,080
so when the oxygen got called i was

650
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,080
doing tasks so i ran over as soon as it

651
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,039
got it was it was it was reactor not

652
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,320
boxing that was called

653
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,520
i think it's corpse and ethan just

654
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,120
because they kind of vouch for each

655
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,679
other i didn't vouch for him

656
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,679
i didn't bad

657
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,520
yeah but there's a triangle of trust

658
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:01,840
here and i'm the

659
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,840
no i i didn't vouch for ethanol

660
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,240
why do you vote for me they you're the

661
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,240
only one

662
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,200
you're the only one that voted me what

663
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,200
the [ __ ] was that

664
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,400
explain yourself all right let's see if

665
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,080
it's ethan

666
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,080
do it ethan do the visual pass

667
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,960
i say that

668
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,400
no i can't click it oh he didn't kill me

669
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,960
visuals are off okay okay okay

670
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,200
why did we turn that off that's like for

671
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,200
fun

672
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,840
let's go dude eighth invited

673
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,679
jack that was an accident i did not mean

674
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,960
to jump into that vent in front of you

675
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,880
so i was like well i have to kill him

676
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,640
you saw me jump into a vent

677
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,640
oh i didn't see and i thought it was so

678
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,640
both of you went down to do the reactor

679
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,000
so i was like okay it's not crystal

680
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,279
corpse because they did it

681
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,039
and bang dang two steps away triangle

682
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,360
means nothing apparently too i didn't

683
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,520
know i never vouched for you than

684
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,960
ever wait is that what made us lose was

685
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,880
the oxygen yeah we died

686
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,279
dude wow wow we do want visual tasks

687
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,799
yeah oh yeah sure see i was looking at

688
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,480
you ethan i was like ethan just doing

689
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,840
he's not faking it but then i was like i

690
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,520
was so sure that you were gonna kill me

691
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,720
i totally thought that you were coming

692
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,960
in there to kill me i was like good

693
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,520
triangle of trust bro i never break it

694
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,960
all right then triangle of trust we

695
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,840
gotta find a third boy

696
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:43,279
no one's doing the oxygen

697
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,120
[Laughter]

698
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,400
we're going to lose because that was

699
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,400
okay that's funny

700
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,400
i always picked the wrong people

701
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,880
oh baby somebody left a body by admin

702
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,880
poor felix

703
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,640
and i stand right after him yeah you and

704
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,799
me are both good we both have our uh

705
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,960
okay so asteroids went down to do oxygen

706
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,039
and i thought triangle meant something

707
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,360
but i guess not kind of ran with me and

708
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,000
then ran away as soon as you saw ethan

709
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,480
chris chris knight scan top left okay so

710
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,640
it's

711
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,080
he probably just reported dave like

712
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,520
because he's imposter and wanted someone

713
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,480
up if it's not dave

714
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,240
it wasn't dave then or they only had a

715
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,760
wife that was watching the stream

716
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,480
and that gave me some water

717
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,440
oh my god did you hear me oh legend

718
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,159

thank you marge

723
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,799
the body's in electrical i will say

724
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,120
corpse i watch

725
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,360
do the leaf task where he blast that out

726
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,960
the the ship [ __ ] so he's safe

727
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,120
i don't think ethan could have gotten

728
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,480
there in time and i definitely think we

729
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,440
got it right with dave

730
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,760
i followed julian around i did see ethan

731
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,039
go

732
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,039
down from cafeteria when we were locked

733
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,919

791
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,880

graceful come in from the side so let's

794
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,679
vote

795
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,039
ethan first then felix then no no no no

796
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,640
no no [ __ ] first because he's the

797
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,640
one i saw on the camera

798
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,880
don't listen to dave all right yeah but

799
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,760
that's the that's the obvious one then

800
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,240
we have him then and we know it okay get

801
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,559
him out

802
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,240
first and it is telling us that he saw

803
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,559
[ __ ] walk on top of a body

804
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,000
yeah on the camera and for some reason

805
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,080
ethan didn't see it which is really

806
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,520
sucks was ethan on cams with you or yeah

807
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,039
he was i mean

808
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,559
i might have seen it you might have seen

809
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,919
it before me because i was

810
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,520
i didn't know how to get the security

811
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,000
you didn't look at the camera yeah i

812
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,600
believe

813
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,120
i believe that what if ethan was just

814
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,080
standing at cams and not actually so

815
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,399
waiting for the cooldown

816
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,440
it's possible okay i'm done with ethan

817
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,919

818
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,679
