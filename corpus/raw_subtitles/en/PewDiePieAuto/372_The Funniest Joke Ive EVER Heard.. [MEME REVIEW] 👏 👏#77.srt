00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:35,320
fell so far from grace it starts with a

112
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,690
Nintendo switch it starts with hey why

laugh at things I don't like so many

124
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,970

125
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,340
beginning of the end for Ian I got it I

126
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,150
