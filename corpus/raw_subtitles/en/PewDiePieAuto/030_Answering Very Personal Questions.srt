00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
Oh welcome everyone to Q&A time with

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,589
PewDiePie for some reason you guys like

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,630
these thank you god I hate these stories

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,730
I don't care

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,250
stop posting them anyway I post them on

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,360
asking you guys to ask me questions so

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,000
let's go

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,250
obviously there are new sources that you

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,800
don't agree with or like but are there

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,840
any you actually recommend of course

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
this may be controversial I think

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,380
there's definitely a couple that are

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,349
good but I think there's an underlying

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,899
issue with most of them where it's as if

15
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,520
journalists jobs functions the same way

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,739
as it is for youtubers where they're

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,780
paid for clicks on their articles so

18
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,190
they're highly motivated to get more

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,050
people to read their article and that

20
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,210
leads to a lot of clickbait it leads to

21
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,890
a lot of hot takes and it makes me

22
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,420
wonder what happened to journalism when

23
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,530
it used to be subscription-based so yeah

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,289
they didn't have to rely on these

25
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,809
tactics that being said why did we as an

26
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,600
audience care about any of these sides

27
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,460
anyway just because they have a new

28
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,770
website we give it some sort of voice of

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,110
authority when in reality most people

30
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,880
don't seem to care anyway so I don't

31
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,049
know it's that it's like even sometimes

32
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,790
when there's a hot take on a website

33
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,170
that no one's heard about but you see

34
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,670
that it's a news website so you're like

35
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,290
oh my god this is so stupid but in

36
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,970
reality is like it doesn't matter I

37
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,159
guess my point is I'm over it I don't

38
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,020
care no that's not true but I hope

39
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,360
people will be as well what are your

40
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,390
future goals after YouTube implying

41
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,070
there's gonna be an after YouTube do you

42
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,360
think YouTube will exist let's say I

43
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,220
have a career until I'm 60 or 65 do you

44
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,140
think YouTube in 30 years is still gonna

45
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,329
be the biggest platform for video

46
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,909
content it's not impossible but it

47
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,619
doesn't seem that likely that YouTube is

48
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,630
just gonna be the top website forever

49
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,670
and if I keep making videos for that

50
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,110
long time I don't I don't think it

51
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,990
matters I found on YouTube or not on

52
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,909
YouTube I think what matters more is if

53
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,390
I still want to make videos at that

54
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,189
point which I don't know the answer to

55
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:00,420
where do you see yourself 20 years later

56
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:02,520
okay here's the question I don't know do

57
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,130
you do anyone know that I think I just

58
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,530
realized who I am as a person and I am

59
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,720
very into the things I like to do I

60
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,300
right now I still really like to do

61
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,110
YouTube but I also think I have a lot

62
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,500
more to give

63
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,960
which

64
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,930
sounds very naive I just feel it myself

65
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,910
that I am capable of more things than on

66
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,910
what I'm doing and sometimes I'm worried

67
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,800
that I'm trapped to make the same daily

68
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,170
kind of videos and not working on bigger

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,780
things and if I'm not sure if that is

70
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,430
holding me back or if that's something I

71
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,440
should just keep pursuing why are you

72
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,800
talking much about politics in the last

73
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,209
month I don't think I have have I how do

74
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,560
you motivate yourself when you don't

75
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,720
want to do something but you have to get

76
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,370
it done write down a list that's always

77
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,500
the best thing whenever I think I'm

78
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,989
stuck and I know I have things to do and

79
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,580
I'm procrastinating I always write it

80
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,560
down a bullet point list of the things

81
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,970
that I need to get done today and that

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,910
way you can start chipping off the easy

83
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,050
bits and then you can get a clear

84
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,570
scheduling your head on how you're gonna

85
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,090
make that done make a video make a

86
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:07,980
thumbnail prep the video prep tomorrow's

87
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:11,880
video answering emails work out read go

88
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,800
home or practice Japanese there you go

89
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,140
that's what my day looks like which

90
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,540
youtuber was the most fun to collaborate

91
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,650
with I think I have the most fun when I

92
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,720
record with Jaken

93
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,269
and Ken because we are actual genuine

94
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,130
friends obviously it's really fun to go

95
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,200
outside and collaborate with random

96
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,150
people it's the kind of thing where as a

97
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,080
youtuber you're benefited to network

98
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,299
right

99
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,560
you're Bennett it's beneficial to reach

100
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,260
out to people that you wouldn't normally

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,810
engage with just as a way to broaden

102
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,610
your scope of Brandon and all that but I

103
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,380
find out to be very I don't like

104
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,290
networking I think it's dishonest and

105
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,269
tri hardy and gross in general what's

106
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,250
your actual net worth you've hinted it

107
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,989
being higher than Google says and what

108
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,299
do you do with that money do you have

109
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,950
invested in stocks or bonds could you

110
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,140
give us a brief overview what you do

111
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,000
with your money right now it's very

112
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,310
messy because I'm set up in Sweden and

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,650
UK so I have like four or five companies

114
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,290
I have some invested in stocks and bonds

115
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,299
but I think overall I don't really spend

116
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,980
it on anything personally because I

117
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,079
don't like having things around me I

118
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,769
find it very annoying I think media

119
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,840
likes to undervalue 8 me now after I

120
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:20,970
became more controversial like in the

121
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,370
Forbes top list I know I'm higher than a

122
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,200
lot of other youtubers on that list but

123
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,270
they always seem to put me lower now and

124
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,830
that's why I'm saying like it is bigger

125
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,620
but at the same time it doesn't matter

126
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,910
who cares it's so unimportant I don't

127
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,340
know I don't know what's important to me

128
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,490
I don't it's not money it's really not I

129
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,199
think money for people is like an inch

130
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,030
people want it because they don't know

131
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,470
what it's like to experience it and then

132
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,810
you have it and you're like actually I

133
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,400
feel the same way now when you retire

134
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,139
from YouTube would you consider founding

135
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,330
a network something so other youtubers

136
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:56,490
can reach their dreams like you well

137
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:59,280
surprise I used to have a network with

138
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,940
Disney called rebel blood and that was

139
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,940
the idea I realized that there are so

140
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,919
many ways that I can create a company or

141
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,409
do all these things but I don't care

142
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,509
it's boring I have the dream job right

143
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:14,729
making YouTube videos is what I sign up

144
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:16,830
to do because I want to do it for me to

145
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:19,740
go into other businesses would be a lot

146
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,419
of time commitment and very boring as

147
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,120
I've learned it's extremely boring

148
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:26,000
compared to YouTube you you have to want

149
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,500
to if you want to pursue a business

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,020
separately and I've already made money

151
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,060
so there's no incentive to be honest I

152
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,740
feel like a lot of times like a

153
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,599
hypocrite because I keep saying I don't

154
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,729
like care about money but I'm obviously

155
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:39,990
still generating a lot of money I'm

156
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,240
still selling merch

157
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:46,199
I'm still putting mid rolls in my videos

158
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,030
I'm still doing sponsors and it's like

159
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,039
if I don't care about money why do I do

160
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,539
these things in a way it feels like

161
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,389
you're validating your work by making

162
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,009
money I know that maybe not makes sense

163
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,080
at all then again the way you make

164
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:00,270
youtube videos and how successful you're

165
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,789
channeling is ties in to how you're

166
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,139
making money as well if your video makes

167
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,300
a lot of money YouTube is going to

168
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:09,090
recommend that video more as well does

169
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,210
that make sense I hope in 2019 I can

170
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,810
start living by my own ideals more does

171
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,310
that make sense

172
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,169
what's something you wish YouTube would

173
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,819
change anything you'd like to see come

174
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:21,090
back put me back in Google preferred

175
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,580
YouTube that reminds me actually I think

176
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,650
that's why I got so caught up with I'm

177
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,050
looking I'm looking at myself now but I

178
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,690
can understand why I want to make more

179
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,840
money because of what happened in 29 at

180
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,880
2017 2017 when the Wall Street Journal

181
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,810
article came out my show was canceled I

182
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,090
was kicked out of Google preferred

183
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,560
getting Brian deals was so much harder

184
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,600
you know they didn't want to touch me so

185
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,430
I wanted to prove okay well you know I

186
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,020
don't need to work with big brands I

187
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,560
don't need to be a friendly friendly

188
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,690
brand to make it and to still earn the

189
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,010
same living so I have to be you know I

190
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,440
wanted to show that I could do that and

191
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,940
that's why I worked myself into that you

192
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,889
know I got to work with a lot of cool

193
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,180
opportunities still like clutch is one

194
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,190
of those companies that were actually

195
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,960
loyal to me even though all that stuff

196
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,190
happened and I think that's that's

197
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,110
really cool and other brands as well

198
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,490
that I'm really happy I can work with oh

199
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,919
yeah I think it's gotten to a point

200
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,260
where it might feels a bit much isn't it

201
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,850
why don't you collaborated videos with

202
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,770
markiplier anymore I think our content

203
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,180
swayed in different directions people

204
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,200
seem to think there's beef between us

205
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,600
that's not it at all

206
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,190
it's literally just I think we probably

207
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,810
have a mutual respect for each other but

208
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,840
we don't have that kind of relationship

209
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:34,389
where we have to collaborate to maintain

210
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,860
anything I don't know it's like a if you

211
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,320
don't interact with someone online

212
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,090
that means you hate each other that's

213
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,949
how people perceive it online the way

214
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,660
the audience perceives relationships and

215
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:46,690
how it is in real life is completely

216
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,750
different from reality and I understand

217
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,000
that's hard to understand maybe but it'd

218
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,470
be great if people aren't blowing all of

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,120
it up for no reason okay

220
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,710
what were the hardest and best moments

221
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,389
of your YouTube career and now have you

222
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,710
always enjoy the content you make well

223
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:01,330
I'll start with the first one I think

224
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,000
both for those things happen this year

225
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,889
best moment was obviously the wedding

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,090
and I got to share that on YouTube but

227
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:08,710
also some of the hard has happened this

228
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,080
year as well and it's mainly stuff that

229
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,389
I've had to sort of dealt with behind

230
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,190
the scenes a lot of things that just it

231
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,139
becomes more complicated if you dress it

232
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,210
online basically but that can also be

233
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:20,950
very frustrating because my whole the

234
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,870
whole way I've dealt with things on this

235
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,120
channel has been I talk about it I

236
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,979
address it and I get support from my

237
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
audience when I do it and that's the way

238
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:29,740
for me to deal with a lot of hardship

239
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,539
that comes with YouTube and then

240
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,240
transfer have I always enjoy the content

241
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:36,370
I make it goes up and down I think in

242
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
general when I find myself not enjoying

243
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,419
what I make that's when I tried

244
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,339
different things and based on you guys

245
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,290
what you guys think of it I go in

246
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:45,520
different directions and that's the fun

247
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,650
of YouTube I think that's why it's

248
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,910
always changing for me and I'm not doing

249
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,800
the same things all the time

250
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,680
how long do you plan on doing YouTube

251
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,749
I've been getting this question so much

252
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,970
all the time because yeah I said I was

253
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:59,800
gonna go on a break and because things

254
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,319
are sort of wrapped up for me almost you

255
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,269
know I got married I hit 100 million you

256
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:06,220
know it would be a good time to just end

257
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,259
it on the high and it's kind of annoying

258
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,209
almost how people keep asking like as if

259
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:12,069
as if I should quit like when are you

260
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:15,819
quitting are you thinking about it maybe

261
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:17,769
you should do it I love YouTube and I

262
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:20,050
think I have more to give I know that's

263
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,550
kind of naive to say but I generally

264
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,829
think so and I sometimes I question

265
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,720
whether you know if it's possible for me

266
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,309
to achieve more by the format I'm doing

267
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,679
now since I'm uploading every single day

268
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:31,600
and if it has longevity in the sense of

269
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,389
I don't really have days off right now

270
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,949
this year has just been extremely busy

271
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,720
it's been the busy year of my life and

272
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:39,819
I've already had extremely busy years

273
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,209
before where I practically broke down so

274
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:45,249
I hope I can find better balance for me

275
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,470
to keep doing YouTube if every year was

276
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:48,809
like it was this year then no I would

277
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,129
not do it for very long

278
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:53,920
what makes you so interested in Japan

279
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:55,540
culture or Japan in general it's like

280
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,029
people think you're a we've just because

281
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,379
you like Japan anyway it's like the

282
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:01,540
least thing that interests me about

283
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:04,059
Japan obviously their culture is so rich

284
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,730
and it's so different from the West and

285
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:08,829
I think a lot of their values and and

286
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,569
way of interacting fits in with me as

287
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:12,279
well it's hard to just point at one

288
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:14,679
thing and say this is what I like when

289
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,910
it's a lot a lot a lot of different

290
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,439
things do you still have the same

291
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,720
passion for making videos as you had 10

292
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:21,519
years ago had his reduced or increased I

293
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,050
would say it's is pretty much the same I

294
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,699
think there was more excitement because

295
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,129
there was so much more growth in the

296
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:29,559
beginning and you go from from nothing

297
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:31,809
to something big in a time but in

298
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,610
general I still really like it because I

299
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:35,050
think I'm still pushing myself to do

300
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,790
different things I've been doing like

301
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,579
this philosophy type of videos and more

302
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,049
of a different style that I'm not used

303
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,730
to and that's beginning a lot of good

304
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,769
feedback so that makes me excited to try

305
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,449
out different things so I am how was

306
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,889
emergency I doing can you guys please

307
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:49,809

together and bring us all a smile - is

312
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:02,499
doing great I think she did quit YouTube

313
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,970
to kind of leave YouTube and she

314
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,799
definitely wouldn't mind being in a

315
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,600
video but I I don't really want to drag

316
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,920
her into that hemisphere

317
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,930
and I understand once he left that you

318
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,370
don't want to be be back into it that's

319
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,019
how I would feel at least if I left

320
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,290
youtube I wouldn't want to keep being

321
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:22,389
hey guys why don't you play horror games

322
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:23,680
again pewds I do play if there's a

323
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,870
horror game that's out that's

324
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,790
interesting I think I played as someone

325
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,250
amnesia mod recently and it was like the

326
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,230
worst performing video I've done in

327
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,970
forever so I know there's some people

328
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,519
that want something but in general you

329
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,899
look at the bigger picture and it's like

330
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,779
I'll do it from time to time if I feel

331
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:42,550
like it but in general it feels like

332
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,170
something I've already done once you

333
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,699
play enough horror games you understand

334
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,009
the premise you understand the whole

335
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,259
thing and it becomes a bit redundant I I

336
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:52,000
do it mainly as a way for nostalgia at

337
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,680
this point it's kind of like as if I

338
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,050
went back to play happy wheels all of a

339
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,990
sudden it's just merrily F for the sake

340
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,180
of nostalgia and it has no it has no

341
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,310
value in itself it's just repetition

342
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,959
which kind of bores me a little bit

343
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,209
serious question how does constant media

344
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,529
coverage both positive and negative

345
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:10,690
affect your well-being

346
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:13,149
I imagine having your friends family

347
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,980
stumbling upon one of your the countless

348
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,319
articles written about oneself must be

349
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,480
taking a toll on anyone's mental half

350
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:22,269
after so many years stay healthy

351
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,610
everyone mental well-being I don't think

352
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:26,470
it affects me if it has they would have

353
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,870
done in the past it's something in

354
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,250
general it's like you cross a line and

355
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,079
it's like it doesn't matter you just

356
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,399
realize it doesn't matter I think in

357
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,380
general they're just digging their own

358
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,180
grave at this point and it's just a

359
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,790
matter of time where there's gonna be a

360
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,860
whole new generation that don't believe

361
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,540
in their credibility anymore do you see

362
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,610
people taking photos in secret

363
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,980
yeah it happens all the time one of

364
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,630
Polish youtubers said he took a photo of

365
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,790
you when he was in UK because he didn't

366
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,620
want to disturb and I wonder if you see

367
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,540
people do that and what do you think

368
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,009
about it it's extremely cringy it

369
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,410
happened actually when I was in Italy

370
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:03,730
now some guy did this and then the flash

371
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:06,189
went off and I'm just like really and

372
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,540
then they don't even go oh and the worst

373
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:09,430
part is afterwards they go up I'm like

374
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,279
hey can we do four I'm like you just

375
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,990
took a photo it's super cringy I hate

376
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:16,240
the fact that people look at me like I'm

377
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,680
some sort of attraction I'm a person

378
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,569
like everyone else and I want to be

379
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,970
treated like a person I don't think

380
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:25,769
that's too much to ask

381
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:27,689
hate the whole culture of I'm so tired

382
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,850
of it and that's why I said if you meet

383
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:32,160
me what you have to say is is math

384
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,500
related to science because that's how I

385
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,769
know if you're a cloud chaser or if you

386
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,439
or if you're a genuine 19 year old the

387
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:42,089
way people react what I found in

388
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:44,100
different countries is very different

389
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:46,290
right if you go to countries like

390
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,779
Malaysia and Singapore people are very

391
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:51,300
hectic and screamish and crazy and they

392
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,040
lose their mind if they see you and they

393
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,779
do all these crazy stuff and and then

394
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,399
you look at countries like when I go

395
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:59,339
back to Sweden people are more like me

396
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,949
more reserved very polite and calm and

397
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,420
just and and more I would say a lot

398
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:05,279
nicer about it which I really really

399
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,709
appreciate so that makes me think the

400
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,629
whole way people react isn't just like a

401
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,819
natural reaction of being nervous it's

402
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:13,769
just like a trained reaction of okay so

403
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:15,990
this is I'm so how I'm supposed to act

404
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,699
if I see a famous person so me

405
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,930
complaining about it isn't like that I'm

406
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:21,509
fed up with it it's more like I want to

407
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,610
change it I love meeting fans don't get

408
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:25,350
me wrong but I also want people to just

409
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,240
treat me normally as well and I don't

410
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,470
like when people scream I don't like

411
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,660
when people get freaked out and I

412
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,009
understand you get excited that's not

413
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,439
what I'm talking against I think there

414
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:36,209
is like a culture to to treat people

415
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:38,160
like they are more than they are and

416
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,259
that annoys me but to answer your

417
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,879
question take people taking fun in

418
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:44,040
secret yeah that's rude and annoying and

419
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,740
it's cringe as hell because I can see it

420
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,779
a lot of time happening where do you see

421
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,279
YouTube in two years from now will they

422
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,170
actually listen to the community anymore

423
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,209
or will they turn entirely into an

424
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,980
advertiser flavor platform that doesn't

425
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,449
care about community I just demonize all

426
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,939
borderline content it seems that they

427
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:01,889
are making steps to improve towards edgy

428
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:04,500
content I've seen them do that with with

429
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:06,569
advertisers YouTube does have to face

430
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,699
with a lot of reality with the reality

431
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:11,189
of backlash that comes from the media

432
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,559
that is inevitably going to affect their

433
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:15,899
advertisers that is a difficult position

434
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,490
to be and to sort of look at the bigger

435
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,160
picture but then at the same time you

436
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,720
have a website that's for creators but

437
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,279
the crater's needs advertisers

438
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,970
I wonder if YouTube just had the balls

439
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,439
to just stand their ground how that

440
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,230
would affect it because they are they

441
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:33,540
are essentially a monopoly I will say I

442
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,000
think I it's obviously complicated and

443
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,680
in a lot of ways I

444
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,470
I understand YouTube but at the same

445
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,220
time I think they made decisions in the

446
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:45,740
past that are so anti youtuber that I

447
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,390
wonder it's gonna take them a lot to

448
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,280
come back to a better point with the

449
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,560
community I think and I think if YouTube

450
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,480
wants to have longevity even if they do

451
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,250
have monopoly they need to get that back

452
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,840
nothing is forever you know

453
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,760
that they could easily become another

454
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,860
website in the future I don't see that

455
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,510
as an impossibility at all you've taken

456
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,190
up many many other passions beside

457
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,510
YouTube such as making video games what

458
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,430
would be another passion you would like

459
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,110
to take up I think music could be fun to

460
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,640
work with I know that's the really

461
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,260
cliche that's like what a lot of

462
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,090
youtubers do but I think it could be a

463
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,210
fun medium for me to express a lot of

464
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,310
ideas and thoughts that it's hard to put

465
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,980
into words in a video I think music

466
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,340
could be an interesting medium to do

467
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,170
that

468
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,540
will you make more philosophical videos

469
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,670
like that I hate Twitter video yeah I

470
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,100
will definitely make more I have some

471
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,510
stuff I'm being then I sort of just let

472
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,890
it simmer in the back of my mind

473
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,170
whenever I feel like thinking about

474
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,000
something so I just make it when it

475
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,770
comes natural light I try not to force

476
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,960
it how do you deal with a lot of hate

477
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,550
alone well I think the important bit is

478
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,710
to understand that everyone is a [ __ ]

479
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:51,020
[ __ ]

480
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:53,480
no I yeah sorry it's making me laugh

481
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,300
because it's it's I'm joking but it's

482
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,280
also true but only because you also have

483
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,600
to be honest with yourself and see okay

484
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,760
if someone says something then it's

485
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,930
making me feel a little uncomfortable

486
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,550
because maybe there's some truth in it

487
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,430
then I think it's important to address

488
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:10,100
that and you said as constructive

489
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:13,100
criticism but I think once you get

490
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,319
something that is just purely stupid

491
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,270
with no logic behind it or constructive

492
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,709
feedback behind it then yeah I treat

493
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,510
everyone like they're an idiot we should

494
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,980
a lot of people art I swear in the

495
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,650
internet it's like the smartest and

496
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,750
dumbest thing ever I don't remember if I

497
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,370
answered it this way but if you could

498
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,860
change something this year what would

499
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,150
would you change if anything definitely

500
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,790
try and find a better balance between

501
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,290
work and time off what do you like so

502
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,630
much about Japan that you are moving

503
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,100
there is it being able to walk around in

504
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,900
public without getting recognized

505
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,400
there's a lot of things that I like

506
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,260
about Japan it's definitely not only

507
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,700
that but that's definitely a plus it's

508
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,860
one of the few Asian countries where I

509
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,679
can actually move around and

510
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,150
get recognized which is very liberating

511
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:53,500
because every time you meet someone they

512
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,270
just want something from you they want

513
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,190
that picture if I can't draw the

514
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,420
distinction if they're a genuine fan and

515
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,950
if they're just someone that thinks

516
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,690
you're famous that's kind of

517
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,610
soul-crushing in a way where are the

518
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,770
kids Felix oh boy

519
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,570
so for years and years and years people

520
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,760
have been pressuring me and Marcy to get

521
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,440
married and now we finally did and where

522
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,820
are the kids

523
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,620
god it's so annoying I wish people

524
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,809
didn't ask to be honest because it

525
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,220
pressures it should be come from us and

526
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,660
it shouldn't come from pray like I don't

527
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,419
want to be pressured about it it's like

528
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,460
no stop it's like I say the smallest

529
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:26,350
thing like oh we're going I'm taking a

530
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,870
break and people like it's gonna make

531
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:31,360
baby or like I don't know if you had the

532
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,460
choice between amnesia and minecraft or

533
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,220
what would you pick well minecraft

534
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,610
obviously do you think your content get

535
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,260
better or worse compared to let's say

536
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,760
2017 do you think you try more or less

537
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,559
when making a video compared to that

538
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,669
time I probably try more because the

539
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,440
videos kind of have to be a little

540
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:49,360
longer now so it does make it a little

541
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,830
bit more complicated before you can just

542
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,780
record like 10 minutes and cut it down

543
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,220
to a five-minute video I think the main

544
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,290
thing I noticed with all the videos is

545
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,250
the voice my voice is so different like

546
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,870
how's it gone Brad

547
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:03,850
hey how yeah it's just so cringy to me I

548
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:07,450
hope I finally find a voice that is

549
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,549
actually my voice open 21 I look back at

550
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,950
now and I don't cringe yeah I don't know

551
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:17,679
why you look depressed for real please

552
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:19,299
tell us why do I look depressed no I'm

553
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,030
not dony

554
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:24,040
so weird I think mainly I'm just

555
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,320
frustrated I think so much happened this

556
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,330
year that I didn't take time to process

557
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,850
and that's also part of reason of this

558
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,559
break I think how did you overcome video

559
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,540
awkwardness and what was your motivation

560
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,919
when you started making videos that's

561
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,480
funny how you mentioned that cuz yeah it

562
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,520
was very awkward to make videos the

563
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,710
first time you do it it's like a weird

564
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,929
thing to speak into a microphone or a

565
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,150
camera it's not normal it takes practice

566
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:49,570
just keep doing it and you'll get over

567
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:51,190
it my motivation was to just create my

568
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:54,250
own path and find something that I liked

569
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,210
I felt very trapped doing what something

570
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,370
that I didn't enjoy

571
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,140
I think I'm extremely fortunate to have

572
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,570
broken out of that the fact that I was

573
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,940
able to turn YouTube into a

574
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,710
question was was my dream it's still is

575
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,140
I'm so happy I can do a job that I

576
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,240
genuinely enjoy doing I think the only

577
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,700
thing like this to summarize this whole

578
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,010
video it's like I love making videos but

579
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,020
being at the precision I am it's way

580
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,360
more than I bargained for I hope things

581
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,940
can just simmer down a little bit

582
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,250
simmer down and next year I can take

583
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,440
some time to fully process a lot of it

584
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,940
as well and that's it for this Q&A hope

585
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,960
you guys enjoyed listening to me

586
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,870
