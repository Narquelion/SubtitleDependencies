1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
are you an introvert or an extrovert

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,870
today we're gonna find out who's the

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,790
fake introvert I'm really excited to

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,679
watch this video because I find a lot of

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,440
times I talk to people and they're like

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,570
oh yeah I'm totally introverted I love

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,570
like sitting home and watching movie

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,300
I would consider myself both introvert

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,550
and extrovert yes that's a thing I feel

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,920
like you can tell sometimes when I make

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,289
videos with other people it's incredibly

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,739
awkward but sometimes I can do stuff on

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,739
stage and it's so epically natural

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,380
[Applause]

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,830
[Music]

16
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:54,739
six introvert one secret extrovert let's

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:56,809
freakin go you believe I'm gonna what

18
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:59,300
it's like discover supplier does already

19
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:02,809
passed right the life spies he or she

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,949
wins the entire fries I don't like how

21
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:04,280
they can lie but I guess that's the

22
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:07,430
point

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:12,380
silent round it's okay

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:14,930
oh so actually get to thanks me everyone

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,539
those introverts can't talk they cannot

26
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,470
communicate what are they saying here

27
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:20,750
that's so weird

28
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,550
I wonder how people react today you

29
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:28,280
really don't stereotype introvert also

30
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:30,259
you believe silent fun fact did you know

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,000
introvert can actually talk normally

32
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:36,200
likes okay let's watch what is he doing

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,880
it's making me uncomfortable

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,950
who's the surrogate this is what

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,110
introverts do all they put a bunch of

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:51,350
introverts in a room this is the result

37
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:53,330
I feel like that's a misconception where

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,490
at least in my experience I feel like

39
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,799
I'm comfortable with silence and a lot

40
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,509
of people aren't especially in America I

41
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,400
found that the conversations with

42
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:03,560
Americans are just like Bam Bam Bam Bam

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,759
Bam Bam Bam and it's like oh I have to

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,280
fill the void with something to talk to

45
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,929
otherwise it's awkward but in reality I

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,970
don't think it is and I find that a lot

47
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,530
of times when people idolize mean like

48
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,810
podcast and suffer like them but oh so

49
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,340
awkward it was quiet for a second like

50
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,290
to me it's more awkward when you're

51
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,690
trying to force a conversation just my

52
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,140
opinion and also very boring I'd rather

53
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,210
be quiet okay this is making me angry

54
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,750
and we're only in halfway stylet rapping

55
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,280
[Music]

56
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:37,280
why is he not looking at her it's so

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,890
weird okay I guess we have to judge just

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,780
like base on appearance if I had to base

59
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,079
just some appearance she seems remote

60
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:49,000
introverted maybe these two as well I

61
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:49,000
don't know her I don't know

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,430
did you notice that notice these two

63
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:02,730
making eye contact she pull away right

64
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:08,430
away she's clear she's clear okay we had

65
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:15,930
to clear so far all right I want to see

66
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:19,290
more who if anyone else did they Hey

67
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,269
she's been cleared to actually I don't

68
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,010
know because I just felt like everybody

69
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,889
was like trying to look into my soul and

70
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:31,200
like determine if I was an introvert or

71
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,859
not okay so you guys voted the one in

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,250
the middle

73
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:39,780
interesting interesting all right fair

74
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:52,530
so they vote right away just based on

75
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:54,449
that what I really appreciate that what

76
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,590
is it called the nature a grasshopper

77
00:03:54,449 --> 00:04:04,590
sound really two fully fully extend the

78
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:10,379
awkwardness all right so everyone thinks

79
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:12,060
ant won races physically or the way bike

80
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,709
mannerisms are I come off as an

81
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,409
extrovert

82
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,669
yeah expect it yeah he does seem bad I

83
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:18,570
think it's funny too because you put a

84
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,609
bunch of introverts

85
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,159
in a box and expect them to be like you

86
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,190
know taking people out and it's like nah

87
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:28,260
we're not you don't do that

88
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:35,430
did you know introverted people can talk

89
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:37,979
all right let's see it this is very what

90
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,919
I guys like to do my wing is her have

91
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:45,060
free time for yourselves I like to watch

92
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:47,310
tip talk take my dog to the dog park

93
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,960
stuff like that she likes to watch Nick

94
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,460
talk yeah she looks like the part at

95
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,039
least how does it make you an introvert

96
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,530
does it I don't think it does I feel

97
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,229
like she dressed up as hot this is how

98
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,360
an introvert looks like my energy and I

99
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:01,950
gain energy from having a long time and

100
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,420
being able to recharge

101
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,950
okay fair

102
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,630
there that's true go back to a place

103
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,950
where I can interact with people

104
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,610
no every time I'd like to paint

105
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:14,190
sometimes like go the beach or hike yeah

106
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,520
I really like running and hiking like

107
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,650
spending time in nature this is a bit

108
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,110
confusing because I feel like she's

109
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,970
she's speaking very extroverted Lee I

110
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,010
would say very I feel like someone that

111
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,110
goes on this show too high that they're

112
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,280
an introvert would not say something

113
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,840
like that you know what I mean they

114
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,000
wouldn't say something that would seem

115
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,450
more extroverted like going outside am i

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,550
right

117
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:40,860
they would be like oh I like to sit home

118
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,480
and yeah yeah well I look like watch now

119
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,490
she's clay also like writing as well

120
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,340
it's like kind of like my creative

121
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,830
outlet sure you're clear Alex next is

122
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,720
like chilli I just do watch like YouTube

123
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,640
videos what I'm not doing anything

124
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,800
see what I mean see what I mean that's

125
00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:00,690
what a fake aim to it I just like to sit

126
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,280
home and I like a video game a bit my

127
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,290
didn't live and it hurts every time I

128
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,670
thought it'd be like nobody bothered me

129
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,670
nobody I'd knock on my door

130
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:16,170
yes my strategy going into the game was

131
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,720
just like maybe pick up on like the way

132
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,520
that people were like standing or like

133
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,500
just the way people held themselves and

134
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,140
they came across as more like confident

135
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,030
or more sure of themselves introverted

136
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,320
people can't be confident it's just

137
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,860
completely impossible

138
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,320
I guess it's such a broad thing everyone

139
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,990
is different at the end of the day

140
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,880
prefer like calling or like texting

141
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,260
people taxi come on what kind of

142
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,640
question is that of course everyone

143
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:50,130
listen introverted prefers texting you

144
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:54,270
can think of what you're gonna say and

145
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:56,820
tell me they're gonna call me I think I

146
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,380
did talk a lot at first because I was

147
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,910
trying to just say something so I wasn't

148
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,169
voted off too early what do you guys

149
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,779
think is like the heart

150
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:10,620
part of being an introvert meeting new

151
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,219
people like fair kind of opening myself

152
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,629
up

153
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:14,819
I've been let's go for like five years

154
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:15,479
my only friend is like my friend from

155
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,629
high school

156
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,310
so like didn't work yeah that seems

157
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:22,469
about accurate I can I can relate to

158
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,840
that meeting new people who has time for

159
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:26,069
that anyway let's get real here for me

160
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,779
like giving futures and like public

161
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:32,639
speaking oh my god a speech yesterday in

162
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:35,159
my class NACO haha no one likes public

163
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,710
speaking no one doesn't matter if you're

164
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,999
extra Verdean to hurt and while I'm like

165
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,629
oh I love to speak and run to these

166
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:44,789
people that no one lice who saw no I

167
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:47,370
just freaked out like for me it's like

168
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:50,310
in large group settings feeling

169
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,830
overlooked or like not considered since

170
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,259
I'm not immediately like vocal about all

171
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,969
my opinions and stuff something I'm

172
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,409
thinking about it and like composing my

173
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:00,080
thoughts and want to say stuff but you

174
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,339
know sometimes in those situations like

175
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,620
everyone talks over and then the moment

176
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,210
goes away I'm not like this but I know

177
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,979
other people that are introvert that I

178
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:17,159
told me that they feel like this so

179
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:19,409
she's safe safe so far I don't trust the

180
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:22,620
girl with the dirty jeans broken jeans

181
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:25,729
and the girl with the flower skirt those

182
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,729
two do not trust

183
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,700
it's a do we tie between Emma and Maya

184
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:44,610
wait seriously they vote out Emma after

185
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,810
she gave like the most perfect answer

186
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:50,760
about what you guys don't deserve money

187
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,330
introverts don't deserve money I'm gonna

188
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,160
say it

189
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,160
you know introvert these are poor

190
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,130
friendly and bubbly and that maybe you

191
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,590
came across as like outgoing so they may

192
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:05,430
be pinpointed me for that I can see that

193
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:09,350
I can see that are we starting you guys

194
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,350
ever done any like the personality test

195
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:18,300
well those are guys like that's a good

196
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:35,670
question what is that like the Advocate

197
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:37,290
yeah but it's turbulent in Sweden we

198
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,450
have a saying yesterday your glory

199
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,580
muslin it means I suspect owls in them

200
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,960
in the marsh and I'm like I'm expecting

201
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:52,530
a lot of house in the mosque right now

202
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:54,990
somebody's like talking about like I

203
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,760
ever I don't know the order I was

204
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,020
seriously clueless so I thought I was

205
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,560
gonna be out once they started doing

206
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,940
that so like what do you guys think you

207
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,590
struggle with the most with being like

208
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,420
an introvert like I was like miss

209
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,560
consumption yeah cause like that's what

210
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:12,540
I'm you know I don't know where it's I

211
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,690
would say for maybe they just assume not

212
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,730
like I hate people like I've been told a

213
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,280
lot that I seem intimidating at first

214
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,530
since I'm so like reserved and I have

215
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,760
like my show I like the reason I brought

216
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,950
it up is because like a lot of people

217
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,790
assume like I'm not confident I'm like

218
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,530
they're like oh you just need to be a

219
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,150
more outgoing and I'm like I'm really

220
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,450
confident myself like I Know Who I am

221
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,790
but that doesn't mean like I can't be

222
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,910
introverted at the same time okay that's

223
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,690
fair you like to complete her me yeah

224
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,910
everybody's on a spectrum

225
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,920
so they sure are well are in a hundred

226
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,839
percent in

227
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,959
or a hundred percent an extrovert we all

228
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,510
have like tendencies of both because no

229
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,130
I think that relates to me a world we're

230
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,370
like somebody's a hundred percent one

231
00:10:52,130 --> 00:11:00,110
thing I actually do talk a lot like with

232
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:02,180
like my close friend like a family but

233
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,190
like outside like social public places I

234
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,790
like a more reserved

235
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:10,070
true-true that's a giving that's a given

236
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,510
determine factor I feel like extroverted

237
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,670
people cannot shut the f--- up about

238
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,649
around people they just met introverted

239
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,060
people only really talk when they they

240
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:18,680
know and aren't comfortable with someone

241
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,600
is that correct I feel like I'm correct

242
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,070
about that I'm basing all of this on

243
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,839
Americans basically because every time I

244
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,399
go in America every wants an extra to

245
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,430
feel safe like why is everyone talking

246
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:32,240
to me stop talking to me stop it maybe

247
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:34,160
I'm just your opinion it's such a

248
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,139
difference though you talk to a stranger

249
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,410
here it's like what what are you doing

250
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:43,850
we don't we don't do that you talk to

251
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:47,630
someone America I'll be like oh it was

252
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,940
strangers - I just like yeah yeah same

253
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:53,510
like I feel like I need my energy

254
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,430
it's my I'm sorry like you were saying

255
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,500
to think that like we're boring people

256
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,050
you know cuz we can have fun but it just

257
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,370
depends on who we're with so well that

258
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,199
means you're boring around people that

259
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,540
think that you are boring around doesn't

260
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,610

261
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,779
have fun with other people I'm not

262
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:14,720
boring I feel that I'm like really

263
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:17,180
emotional like with my close friends I

264
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,170
like let all of it out but then with

265
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,940
people I'm not what the hell is

266
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,899

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:26,079

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,329
flower same same I really think these

270
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,910
strongly that these three are safe these

271
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:40,699
two I don't know I would still vote her

272
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:43,190
I voted for Alex because I could see him

273
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:44,980
at a party like having fun he just kind

274
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,009
of had a bubbly

275
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,009
[Music]

276
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:55,720
introverts cannot have fun at parties

277
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,990
impossible I see what you mean but yeah

278
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,150
that sounds really funny introverts go

279
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:06,100
to party and they cry they cry every

280
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:07,600
time Dan they were too mad huh I'm like

281
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,070
surrounded by other introverts I'll

282
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,660
notice I'll be the ones that just kind

283
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,550
of like step up and talk more so I think

284
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,020
maybe people saw that I was being like

285
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,700
that was a little bit more comfortable

286
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:20,340
within the group so they kind of saw

287
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:29,170
that as maybe like an extrovert I

288
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:31,630
continue continue while the confidence

289
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,580

290
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,140

we're both introverts and we're both

294
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,990
really independent we know like when to

295
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,610
give each other space like we know that

296
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,080
it doesn't mean that we don't care or

297
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,660
love each other less it just means like

298
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,390

323
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,560
as for boasting everyone else they seem

324
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:10,040
more nervous and kind of anxious you

325
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:11,780
guys still with like anxiety did you

326
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,790
tonight guys not heard from Jake Paul

327
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,440
anxieties in real what do you say what

328
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,140
are you talking about do you guys have

329
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,110
like a method for anxiety like how to

330
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,710
calm down anxiety anxiety that's not how

331
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,810
you say it

332
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,150
learn to speak Maya go back to speaking

333
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,650
school I'm still looking for one okay I

334
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,680
have a really hard time like coming down

335
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,360
when I'm really anxious so it's like

336
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,610
hard for me because I shot down

337
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,070
completely like I can't talk or anything

338
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,510
when I'm really anxious so it's mostly

339
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,820
like just me sitting and like staring at

340
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,380
a wall yeah for me it's like music or

341
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,300
just kind of like deep breathing

342
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,460
yeah same like the way I go to sleep

343
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,590
because I have like insomnia like I

344
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,770
can't go to sleep and so like I'll play

345
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,600
like the meditation music on YouTube and

346
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,700
it kind of just like mellows me out

347
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,600
because I overthink a lot and that's

348
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,600
what keeps me up at night

349
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:06,950
there's nothing to do with introvert but

350
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,720
I feel like people with inner vert it's

351
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,820
like what I said about Kingdom Hearts

352
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,410
people with introvert cannot shut the up

353
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,890
about their anxiety I'm just kidding I'm

354
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:19,130
joking I'm joking that was too hard

355
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:22,160
they voted her out damn it look like I

356
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:24,620
guess I would have done the same out

357
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,750
there yeah yeah it's your life surround

358
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,640
that people would vote me off just off

359
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,750
of the first look but I was surprised

360
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,750
that I stayed so long

361
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:46,510
okay I think they're done vibes they

362
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:48,310
passed the vibe check okay all right

363
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,130
here's the moment of truth who is it

364
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:54,990

365
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,990

366
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,830
what I mean

367
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,920
recent last round and losing was really

368
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,270
heartbreaking I was pretty upset because

369
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:17,800
I thought we had it I thought we had

370
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:20,610
them all out you're at Stinky's how can

371
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,610
you just lie like that

372
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,060
she's really good at lying

373
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,910
you sociopath she should be a defined

374
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,830
associate bad Jake okay I was like very

375
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,180
sincere about my answers like did you

376
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:39,220
feel that way about introverts like I

377
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:41,710
feel like I feel bad yeah yeah I'm 100%

378
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,810
on the extrovert side what I'm an ENFJ

379
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:47,710
my number one passion is communication

380
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:49,600
and like so she gives me like more

381
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,730
energy than anything like I could spend

382
00:17:49,600 --> 00:18:02,920
every single day with some quick Wow

383
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:06,310
okay all right about being like an

384
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,870
introvert you typically think someone

385
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,610
who's God I need to go back to speak

386
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,830
school dammit sorry someone who's

387
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,140
generally like very quiet but what it

388
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,390
really means is that we as introverts

389
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,150
just get energy from ourselves like we

390
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,010
need to like if we need some space we

391
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,270
get that from reading a book or you know

392
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,190
watching some Netflix as they were

393
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,690
saying that's true that's true

394
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,160
I feel like I'm both though I can get

395
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,950
energy from other people as well I it's

396
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,660
just like if it's too much I get

397
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,270
overwhelmed and I don't like it I wanted

398
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,730
to represent more extroverted introverts

399
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,910

400
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:42,010

402
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:48,800

403
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:54,050

having fun parties I love that comment

408
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,000
okay just because you're an introvert

409
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,320
doesn't mean you're not confident well

410
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,690
these people maybe integrate a lot of

411
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,520
them are are also socially awkward I'm

412
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,740
an introvert and I still like talking to

413
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,810
people having fun I just need some time

414
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,520
alone to recharge so maybe I'm just

415
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,900
awkward around people maybe that's my

416
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,390
issue maybe I got this whole thing wrong

417
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,400
