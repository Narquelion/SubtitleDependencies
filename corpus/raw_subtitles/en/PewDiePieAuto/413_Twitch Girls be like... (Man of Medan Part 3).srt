00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:48,340
the folder I'm playing an early version

34
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:52,750

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,950
could die I don't mean that in a bad way

37
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,950
it's just like it just sounds like a

38
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:04,530
character in a movie life is expendable

39
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:06,939

find old stuff and an old [ __ ] that's

46
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,760

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,240
also 100 million we hit it gamers I

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,080

that's all I'm saying

75
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:53,000
they could have given a little slightly

76
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:55,900
longer pants I don't think those pants

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,900
