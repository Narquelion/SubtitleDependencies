00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:01,110
trade with them I can just take this out

39
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,840
and replace it and it should actually

40
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,510
change somehow their profession again

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,630
but only if I haven't traded

271
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,610
different around here from now on this

nothing else all year all right so now

274
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:58,839
what we can do is we can drink the milk

275
00:15:51,740 --> 00:16:01,670
the titty and there will be no more

276
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:04,580
debuff that makes us so I can't mine and

277
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:08,690
stuff which means we can take these back

278
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:11,589
down oh my god infinity is the best so

279
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:14,959

don't know why this is so oddly

284
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:37,210
satisfying to do it's like

285
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:44,830
weird ASMR ah oh that was good yeah

286
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:48,720

now we can peacefully get the gold for a

290
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:05,910
year again now I can just tell people I

291
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:13,030
built this place and no one will know I

292
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:15,820

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,420
know when it's finished

297
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:34,870
so yeah this took me about an hour to

298
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:38,520
clear out then I finally plays down the

299
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,520
conduit so that's cool

300
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:48,370
then I decided to big a tunnel back to

301
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:52,960
my spawn then I realized that tunnel was

302
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:56,500
in the wrong direction when I finished

303
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,050
up the the right tunnel and that's where

304
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,800
we're back baby okay so three hours

305
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:04,960

in like Episode nine when you were

331
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:44,110
caught underneath water and we were all

332
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:44,740
so scared well now we rule the water

333
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,940
baby

334
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:51,250
that's right Sven look at this so

335
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:56,430
awesome so but yeah I got the whole

336
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:59,980
thing completely dried it's so dope I

337
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:02,890
also have the conduit as well so even if

338
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,690
I go into water full night vision full

339
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,030
breathing does that work for Sven as

340
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,990
well that'd be so cool get the out of

341
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:14,290
house yeah get him Sven

342
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:20,350

343
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:22,860

344
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:26,080
you can get him

345
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:28,390
you did it spend good job

346
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,660
so yeah just to show you guys the whole

347
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,640
stay the whole thing baby it's so

348
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:39,010
satisfying to use the sponges why did I

349
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:40,600
do this because I can that's why now I

350
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,700
was saying like a lot of people do this

351
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,560
and then they keep this as their main

352
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,690
hub I don't think that's what I want to

353
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,520
do I just wanted to see for me it was

354
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,350
like a bucket list try not to get lost

355
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,820
in it could be dangerous all right well

356
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,320
we should head back because we have some

357
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,870
other stuff to do but yeah the conduit

358
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,020
is in here it is tempting if I should

359
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:05,230
get it back actually yeah look at that

360
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:08,350
yeah we rule the oceans thing I am

361
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:11,770
Poseidon the Poseidon has the Trident

362
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:14,050
right the god of the Greek mythology god

363
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,210
of the ocean apparently it was going to

364
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,880
be decided between Hades who's the god

365
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:22,680
of the underworld between hit cuz

366
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,910
they're Poseidon Hades are brothers and

367
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,050
when it was decided between them who was

368
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,140
gonna rule the underworld and who's

369
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,870
gonna rule the ocean they were always in

370
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,090
such competition with each other that

371
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:37,060
when he was announced that Poseidon got

372
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:39,610
to rule the ocean he just went yeah

373
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:43,540
Frick yeah even though that's not

374
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:45,820
necessarily what he wanted he just

375
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,560
wanted to shove it in Hades face and

376
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,630
Hades did the exact same thing beyond

377
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,900
the world yes that's awesome that's what

378
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:56,050
they want to rule some random Greek

379
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,690
mythology in the PD pilots minecraft

380
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:02,140
letsplay why what would you guys prefer

381
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:04,990
to rule the underworld or the ocean I'd

382
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,640
pick the ocean so yeah I built this

383
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,140
thing here because I thought it could be

384
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,920
cool to build a track in between the

385
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:15,580
houses coming from Ikea tower god the

386
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,070
game likes whenever I come here I think

387
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,750
it's time to fight the weather soon so

388
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:26,020
it's like please there's something about

389
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:30,010
baby we're back gamers so it's about

390
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:32,110
dang times that I enchant my try to do I

391
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,440
have it channeling yeah it is blunt so

392
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:38,880
yeah this will give it channeling

393
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,290
the enchantment which means that once

394
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,690
there's a thunderstorm

395
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:45,240
once I if I hit the pigs that will be

396
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:49,050
turning to pig soldiers which we're

397
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,360

our our village look he became amazing

451
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,240
now so I can change the trade of these

452
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,210
just by placing a work block in front of

453
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,650
them hopefully in a second same with

454
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,960
this one I just removed it and he just

455
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,760

456
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,050
obviously expand this so I can trade

457
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,929

461
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,750
