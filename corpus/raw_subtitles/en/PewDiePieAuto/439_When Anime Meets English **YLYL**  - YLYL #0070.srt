everyone to be fair the Japanese

55
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,140
language like to borrow a lot of English

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,450
words which already sounds kind of funny

57
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,010
yeah you feel you feel like you're

58
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,530
almost not supposed to say it you're

59
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,450
something like I don't I don't think I'm

60
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,610
supposed to say that like food food

61
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,220
related items especially are usually

62
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,790
appropriated from the English language

63
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:17,390
like curries kadhi I think and coffees

64
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:21,229
Kohi what else for ku it's for what good

65
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,940
spoon spoon hmm there we go

66
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:24,740
kay on the movie I didn't know I had a

67
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:34,000
movie i watch this back in the day oh my

68
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:34,000
god why are you going which one

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:47,680
[Music]

70
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,570
I can't relate so hard to this I'm like

71
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,940
I prepared the sentence I'm supposed to

72
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,440
say and I say it they're the best of my

73
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,310
ability but then they get a question

74
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,140
back and I'm like ah and then they speak

75
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,760
perfectly English I know I'm laughing at

76
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,410
Japanese people speaking bad English but

77
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,060
surprising a lot of Japanese people

78
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,370
speak really good English

79
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:35,080
it's always so humiliating like oh yeah

80
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:36,850
I guess I'm speaking English what would

81
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,670
be the English version of that I love

82
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:51,160
tea I love meatballs I'll just pull that

83
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:52,930
next time I mess up German bras tell me

84
00:05:51,160 --> 00:06:01,420
if that was accurate as I can tell that

85
00:05:52,930 --> 00:06:03,880
was spot-on yeah it's funny though I

86
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,620
mentioned like one word in Russian and

87
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,790
all the Russian bros are like oh my god

88
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:13,090
I say one word in Japanese in like

89
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:14,860
that's not how you say that cringe she

90
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,040
got it all wrong the way you conjugate

91
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,040
that verb

92
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,010
we go into Japan that's exactly what

93
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,370
happens I feel like Jojo oh yeah they

94
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:40,199
definitely Jodie has a ton of I gotta

95
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:46,350
get Jo doing their George oh should we

96
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:49,889
just start god damn is so quick it's so

97
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:52,620
funny it's not funny in this context jo

98
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:54,419
du-sik what is it granddad always swears

99
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,320
in English it is so funny because it's

100
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,320
so out of place

101
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,339
[Applause]

102
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,279
[Music]

103
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,380
goodbye judges this is not voice acting

104
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:33,090
but it's when you fire all the activator

105
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:38,210
same channel as before it's basically

106
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:38,210
the same humor at the same oh my god oh

107
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:55,260
they're trying they're trying their best

108
00:07:45,330 --> 00:08:00,650
okay oh my god even though this is just

109
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,650
his face forever it's a puppet

110
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,530
it looks like they just took the

111
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,569
storyboard and even made that into an

112
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,190
animation oh my god did you see the

113
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:13,270
woman in the back Jesus Christ that's

114
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:22,120
terrifying

115
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:23,680
he's still back I feel a little bad

116
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,680
because obviously I mean I don't know

117
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,849
the context why it became like this

118
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,030
sometimes they got a crunch for time I

119
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:37,990
don't know maybe sometimes people just

120
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:43,899
go oh my god oh wow

121
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:48,970

yeah like a cape blowing better that's

149
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,879
what makes good

150
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:14,290
something with consistent movement yeah

151
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,790
I understand that why it's good isn't

152
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,040
this what people already do when they

153
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,410
say fake super-slow-motion

154
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,200
