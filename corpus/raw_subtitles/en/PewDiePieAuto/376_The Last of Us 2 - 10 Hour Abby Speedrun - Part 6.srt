can you guys hear my playstation I don't

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,899
[ __ ] I didn't have time to set it up you

27
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,660
know what it's not gonna be perfect

28
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:17,860
today we waited long enough

29
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:30,550
that looks good yeah I like this I feel

30
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:31,890
like yeah like [ __ ] sake okay somewhat

31
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,750
better

32
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:40,900
it disappears when I click on a okay

33
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:51,720
I'll just have to do it like this Boosh

34
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:54,750
oh now no I'm fast at fixing stuff yeah

35
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,060
are you like that [ __ ] that looks

36
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:01,130
unsymmetric whatever who cares

37
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,020
we're not here for symmetry

38
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:10,500
okay so another thing I want to check is

39
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:13,650
the delay between the gameplay and me

40
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,230
speaking so just tell me if this is

41
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,910
synched or not when I hit right it will

42
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:23,730
go right or left

43
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:26,730
so right left right laughs it seems to

44
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:33,380
bit off doesn't it I can see just from

45
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,380
my mouth left right left

46
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,080
okay I'll reduce it delay a little bit

47
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,640
[Music]

48
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,640
if my brain can do that

49
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,270
I removed 200

50
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,270
[Music]

51
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:13,610
okay so let's try that again right life

52
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:13,610
yeah that seemed better right

53
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,430
[Music]

54
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,229
seems good enough

55
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,139
big brain all right the moment we've all

56
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,410

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:47,560
remember how you play it now doesn't

62
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:52,180
matter nothing matters anymore there's

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,889
no point to anything in life and the

64
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,000
game looks good on this display I got

65
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:59,800
this like panic display that I can't

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,840

69
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,760
consequences how's the clock in the door

70
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:10,449
that's more important maybe there's

71
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:17,919
another way in I don't have as good

72
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:19,570
internet here people have been saying

73
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,669
that he's a self-insert like the

74
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,539
developer looks like him some people say

75
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:28,900
he put himself in there but I think he

76
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:32,560
addressed it or something why you killed

77
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:38,200

I find that so cringy people taking it

84
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,660
way too far it's a game

85
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:12,589

why does Abby have guns and when she

96
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:57,769

scope really I'm just gonna keep going

429
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:09,350
we're speedrunning through here

430
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:16,930

431
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:32,080

I'd be such a hero always something

435
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,480
violent for the greater good

436
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:51,070
I watched a donkey's review on it which

437
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,150
was interesting because he praised the

438
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,640
game a lot and I think that was

439
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:57,100
unexpected cuz he hated the first one

440
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,400
yeah I know it's loud up my back I could

441
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:02,700
maybe turn down a little bit there was

442
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,450
one thing he said that was so funny

443
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,450
[ __ ] if I remember

444
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:15,330
that's up it's like

445
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:17,370
one bad act can inspire inspires up

446
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,470
there some [ __ ] like that I don't

447
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:22,700
remember exactly and then but one good

448
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:26,300
deed can inspire others as well

449
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:30,020
that's why Abbey [ __ ] murdered Joel

450
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:34,530
after Joel's saving his life her life oh

451
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:37,670

game this is really fun Oh God are you

510
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:41,930
seriously compelling about the frame who

512
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:54,450

I guess is the first time setting up it

523
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:57,790

759
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:29,840
theater but for fish all I want to do

831
01:08:14,739 --> 01:08:22,739
them to break the rules to let's see how

832
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:37,810
much trouble were in when we get back

833
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:40,659
it's a base here they are yeah I'll read

834
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:44,859
the note in a sec so basically what

835
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:52,659
divides the game is if you like sin

836
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:57,060
Darris or not which confirms that if you

837
01:08:52,659 --> 01:08:59,230
like this game then your ascent okay

838
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:00,670
it's honourable that you respect your

839
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:02,679
father but you have to see is trying to

840
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:04,060
control you to make you feel like you're

841
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:05,409
still a child because she's too afraid

842
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:07,179
to act like a man you deserve to be

843
01:09:05,409 --> 01:09:09,400
surrounded by a community that can

844
01:09:07,179 --> 01:09:11,980
foster a strong spread like yours max

845
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:14,799
even more so he's so impression of all

846
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:17,500
if you care about your brother you will

847
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:19,900
get him out of there before can't be

848
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:22,770
bothered reading more your mama is a

849
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,770
little blower

850
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:40,950
can I look at that

851
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:44,150
would you mind I think this is our boat

852
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:47,730
captain [ __ ]

853
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:50,490
Abby its tier five muscle increased to

854
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:51,840
strong dad I'm taking max away from me

855
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:53,910
he can't spend his life locked inside

856
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:56,610
this rotten building all he'll do is

857
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:58,170
take on your weaknesses when the

858
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,790
soldiers killed mom you just stood there

859
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:01,350
like a coward what kind of example is

860
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:03,330
that you should have gotten angry should

861
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:04,560
have made them hurt okay I want max to

862
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:08,090
see what it looks like when people are

863
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,090
willing to stand up for what they want

864
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:13,260
maybe when we'll come back done it

865
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:15,980
someday if we do I hope you're not still

866
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:28,760
sitting in your stupid [ __ ] chair Oh

867
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:31,440
No Oh on the bright side family's keys

868
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,940
we should lift the body so skeleton he

869
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,310
does it on top with a whale or something

870
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:39,690
I just don't understand how anybody

871
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:42,810
willingly joins us cars why not because

872
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:44,400
they're an insane cult that's why I'm

873
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:47,150
gonna accuse these people will refer to

874
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:50,340
the fireflies the terrorists fanatics

875
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:52,200
it's not the same I'm just saying don't

876
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:53,580
say [ __ ] like that of the stadium okay

877
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:58,650
okay all right

878
01:10:53,580 --> 01:11:00,710
let's go to max place there is max pace

879
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:03,690
that'd be my guess

880
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:09,050
dude his artistry improved over time not

881
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:12,090

882
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:13,380
