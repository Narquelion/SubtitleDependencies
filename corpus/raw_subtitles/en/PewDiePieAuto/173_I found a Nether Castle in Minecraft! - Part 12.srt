00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,000
freaked up on this one right then what

458
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,220
that sounds like it's brewed awkward

459
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,100
potion no effects okay so now we have

460
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:36,230
three awkward potions huh relatable I'm

461
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:37,040
awkward relatable so now we combine with

462
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,650
the pufferfish

463
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,200

464
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:46,010
can't do this right I can't just put a

465
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,470

467
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,450
ones I want to get the thing out of the

468
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:57,050
bucket

469
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:59,750
Oh God that was a bad idea was it stop

470
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,200

471
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,840
sit

472
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,110

473
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,110
panic

474
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:19,479
okay I'm dying in my own house bye

475
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:21,159
No okay okay cool oh I thought Sven

476
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:23,529
would attack it I got so scared

477
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:26,009
all right cool so I guess that's one way

478
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:26,009
to get it

479
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:34,389
I'm sorry puffer I'm sorry you died okay

480
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:37,779
so now I think I combine awkward potion

481
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:39,789
with puffer fish and redstone so I make

482
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:42,129
it with redstone instead of blaze power

483
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:44,109
is that correct listen the instructions

484
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:47,469
aren't very clear I'm just gonna try it

485
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:50,379

555
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,340
think that's really all that matters in

556
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:40,200
Minecraft okay I got a little I keep

557
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,929
buying my paper is the finest quality

558
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,940
Swedish paper its Scandinavian design

559
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:46,799
pick I literally don't have my paper are

560
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,600

trying to feed the cat cooked fish sorry

566
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,929
apparently number one rule of Minecraft

567
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,700
is that cats eat raw fish is it worth

568
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,620
setting up like a rail system in another

569
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,600
so I can travel faster that makes sense

570
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:15,090
right

571
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:17,519

575
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:26,010
make potion of Aleen okay that that

576
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:27,149
doesn't sound that good I'm sure we'll

577
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:29,279
need it for the ender dragon or

578
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:31,470
something like that if we add a spider

579
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,630
eye or something else to potion of

580
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,679
healing it becomes portion of farming

581
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,090
what does that do

582
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,889

583
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,720

794
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,810
this means I have 12 and I think I

795
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,090

796
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:27,970
the place I need one more what am I

797
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:29,530
talking about well you basically let me

798
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,100
see if this is correct I think I can

799
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:35,470
make an eye of ender now I owe

800
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,540
that's when I can make an ender chest

801
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:40,630
now as well which which is like a portal

802
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,340
chest okay so I think you just throw it

803
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,530
up somewhere and you see which way it

804
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,710
goes and that the way it goes is where

805
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:49,380
the portal to the ender thing is where

806
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:53,470
did it go there it is so it's that way

807
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:55,480
whoa okay let's remember that so that

808
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:57,040
way is that the way to the ender portal

809
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,830
but we're not gonna do that now we're

810
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,869
not gonna do that now okay I think

811
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:04,240
that's it for today's episode is a night

812
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:06,070
