[Music]

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:15,199
today making Swedish pancakes let's fly

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,270
American pancakes

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,650
what is this disgusting sweet pancakes

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,670
was one of the first things I learned to

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,189
make in terms of cooking it's very

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,869
simple anyone can make it and all the

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,580
sudden you were realized these are the

10
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,730
best pancakes you could make all other

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:37,320
pancakes fairly in comparison it's not

12
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,940
right Marcia she says yes with there's

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,370
so much confident I'm how much you know

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:49,200
because I'm so tall look at this so all

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:52,860
right eggs flour my assistants we can

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:01:01,140
use protein powder as flour Oh muscle

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:06,409
gain this illegal butter yeah salt milk

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,409
and then you put the jam my templates

19
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:13,090
the tallow and pancakes this is probably

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,820
one of the hardest things for me to

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,539
accept with our marriage that might say

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,360
it wants to put into telling you put can

23
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:26,200
you put can you should try one stop

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,119
shaking pepper the best thing about this

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,770
recipe my dad taught me this recipe

26
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:36,009
because my pancakes every year Sunday

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,259
and then his mom would cook pancakes

28
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:40,869
rather than every week as well so it's a

29
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:44,549
Swedish tradition and switch paintings

30
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:48,850
often get mixed up with the cracks

31
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:54,640
yeah my Sicily no no we're not making

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:58,030
friends well people think sweets bangers

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,520
are crazy but they're not the recipe is

34
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:03,780
from actually my dad said the recipe is

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,759
from like a Donald Duck Magazine recipe

36
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,830

Swedish epic thing yeah you guys come on

38
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:14,320
with Donald OTT yes the recipe is so

39
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,900
easy because you can remember it in your

40
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,790
head so 100 milliliter is one this later

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,739
British people I hate you why are you

42
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,160
doing this okay I'm just gonna I'm gonna

43
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:27,220
skip the protein is to complicate

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,510
already I'm my brain is confusing okay

45
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,519
two deciliters of flour Bing these are

46
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,420
not best leader so I have to adjust it

47
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,060
bang

48
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,530

49
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:45,470
remember that to to bein being bank bone

50
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,630
one that Gary's watching this was great

51
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,610
in fact you can't see him

52
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,920
oh you're making Swedish pancakes that's

53
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,870
my favorite I rob free to pancake

54
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,640
they're not like those French crepes and

55
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,970
there's crack the American lunch Thank

56
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,570
You Hector thank you hey they're all in

57
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,910
wrong order

58
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,520
Oh God that frickin will disappear like

59
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,440
this next up and get the milk I don't

60
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,470
usually drink milk but I don't I want to

61
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,989
be true to the recipe so for this a

62
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,660
liters of milk so two to four that's all

63
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:17,120
you gotta remember wait so this is 215

64
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:24,800
someone for ya yeah I'll do a little

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:26,390
incentive why are you laughing yes yes

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,310
what a bit of salt it's important not to

67
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,280
forget the salt I usually just do like

68
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:34,820
that okay that looks good bang now we

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,660
whisk this baby I remember my dad always

70
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,730
whisking like this and I was like make

71
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,790
sure your whisk it properly look at this

72
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:47,120
technique my dad would be proud

73
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,890
my grandma would put a sour milk instead

74
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,100
of regular milk I don't think you have

75
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:54,769
sour milk in UK but it's really good it

76
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:58,090
sounds gross but it's good I think this

77
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:58,090
is too much flour excellent

78
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:09,670
[Music]

79
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:11,680
dude this was an anime I've been

80
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:15,070
watching ever worse this would be in

81
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,220
slow motion oh my god

82
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:21,060
he's risking so good

83
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,950
impossible how does he do it so well ahh

84
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,590
are you impressed Marcin that looks nice

85
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,960
nice and even no bits of flour in there

86
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,640
just curl up okay

87
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,670
actually I should have heated up the

88
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,240
pants while I did this I'm sorry to be

89
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,060
fair

90
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:46,450
science has helped us make pants go

91
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:47,980
quicker then when I I probably put way

92
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,550
too much butter in it but I don't care

93
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,550
not only just

94
00:04:51,890 --> 00:05:01,860
[Music]

95
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:10,529
and we don't have a spatula we used to

96
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:26,370
have to I wonder where they I throw away

97
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:27,900
what we don't mean I kind of want to put

98
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,029
on the things it would be too loud for

99
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,029
just a magic sign anything fan noise

100
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:42,240
yeah yeah spread out the butter

101
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,400
come on what's so funny I'm making

102
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,029
pancakes you want to make sure that it's

103
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,009
spread out evenly across so that it

104
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:52,319
doesn't stick to the pan

105
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:57,870
once you flip it and you want it this

106
00:05:52,319 --> 00:06:01,080
golden golden fly a forever yes you like

107
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,870
that within the fluid give it another

108
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,580
extra waste okay and then you pour it

109
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,819
this is very important for from the

110
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:19,919
center make sure it's even

111
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:23,099
beautiful I think I put too much goddamn

112
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,699
but I'm a nice name do the same thing

113
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:29,659
I'm the other one perfect

114
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:32,219
now too thick now not too thick

115
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:33,840
these are not American pancakes they're

116
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:36,599
not supposed to dick but they're not

117
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,870

118
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:45,060

called laptop stolen oh but this is

121
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:54,509

122
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:57,810
to store yeah see that looks good you're

123
00:06:54,509 --> 00:07:01,080

normal that's extra flavor as we call a

126
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,150
flower kick we call that experience got

127
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,099

pretty good

132
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:23,939
I always thought it was so cool when

133
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,069
people flip the pancakes just a little

134
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,469
bit more I'm just so nervous I mean I'm

135
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:41,430

[Music]

139
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:50,300
patience is the key of the mastering of

140
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,129
Swedish pancake it's like watching a

141
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,150
flower from the beach
