247
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:01,010
honest I think I should build a roof

248
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,050
that's just a theory I have so I'm gonna

249
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,280
stay true to that theory and do it the

250
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,440
tower of Ikea

251
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,030

252
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,730
this game but I'm telling you right now

253
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,860

don't need your criticism I just started

257
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:22,580

258
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,500
