00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
far i'm not gonna lie it's kind of

77
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,120
not that interesting so far what do you

78
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
guys think

79
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,520
hoping it picks up but the whole it's

80
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,520
just that we just played a game

81
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,800

82
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,800
i don't know do i really want to

83
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,880
another one

84
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:49,840

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,440
okay now i can see and now we can play

86
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,360

the kamatsu forge

92
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,880
we can get waxwood guys

93
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,440
why don't we just explore while we're

94
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,440
still here

95
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,639

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,199
while we're at it what the hell is

97
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,199

118
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,540

121
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360

i'm playing on jab with j oh that looks

123
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,680
pretty

124
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:23,440
should we go there we're japanese

125
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,800
dub it is annoying how they prioritized

126
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,080
english with the uh with the dubbing

127
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,080
there's the mongolians

128
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,839
but it is what it is

129
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,800
damn so pretty

130
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,320
they really just went full out on

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
atmosphere

132
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,240
ipads my first first time doing it

133
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:05,839
through a stream but my

134
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,839
thank you say hi to edgar edgar says hey

135
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,920
some comments i read said that

136
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,399
apparently the mongolians did

137
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,920
try to evade japan but they failed

138
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,720
mainly because of a typhoon

139
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,760
and not because of the samurai but i'm

140
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,519
sure that's just what the

141
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,519
mongolians like to tell each other

142
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,839
we found a little house

143
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,800
such a cool looking game

144
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:50,720
let's see what we got

145
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,760
oh my god that bug is so disturbing

146
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,760
it's the second time

147
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,360
we out here we're entering random

148
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,959
people's houses

149
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,040
maybe we should go back to the objective

150
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,480
my bad just wanted to look down around a

151
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,800
little bit since it's been a while since

152
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,800
i play

153
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,760
uh and yes some people are cringing over

154
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,079
me speaking japanese

155
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,880
i think people misinterpret me wanting

156
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,480
to learn

157
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,880
japanese as opposed to me being

158
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
trying to pretend that i speak it or

159
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
like i'm an annoying

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,880
weave that goes

161
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,440
uh full on the hunger

162
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,519
epicly i feel like uh

163
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,880
it's such a difficult language that any

164
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,240
chance i can get

165
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,760
to immerse myself or or remind myself of

166
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,440
a word i'll take it

167
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,399
i don't care if it sounds cringy you're

168
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,399
cringy shut up

169
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:10,000
so long story short i'm not a weeb okay

170
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:11,600
just so we're clear i'm not a weeb

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
all right let's go to the objective then

172
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,000
my bad

173
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,200
let's deal with the

174
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:25,680
lady masako can we fast travel there

175
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,600
let's just do that then

176
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,200
[Music]

177
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,519
i feel like the most effective way to

178
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,519
learn is to suggest to immerse yourself

179
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,839
um at least from what i can tell

180
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,720
you can study it all you want but if you

181
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,959
don't practice actually saying words out

182
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:53,839
loud it's such a difference

183
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,839
uh where is she

184
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,839
i read somewhere that 9 out of 10 that

185
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:07,839
try to study japanese don't

186
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,839
learn japanese it's pretty crazy

187
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,720
because it is such a language where like

188
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,200
you have to dedicate

189
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,839
your next couple years actually really

190
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
studying it

i feel better

805
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,480
i think the favorite thing for me with

806
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,520
meditating is

807
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,520
it puts you in the moment

808
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:32,160
when you're always doing stuff

809
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:39,039
um especially nowadays it's so easy to

810
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:40,000
get distracted you just go on your phone

811
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,559
or you just

812
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,160
watch someone's live stream you just

813
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:46,160
click click click there's a click away

814
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:49,280
to always get distracted but

815
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:51,200
take some time and meditate because it

816
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:54,480
really helps

817
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:56,960
changing your uh mindset of

818
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,640
it breaks you away from that cycle of

819
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,119
constant distraction and it puts you in

820
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,119
the moment

821
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:10,000
i recommend that's right

822
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:11,359
why did i call jurgen here clearly he

823
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:19,839
can't go

824
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:19,839
how the hell did he even get up here

825
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,799
because once you're put in the moment

826
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:28,319
you actually enjoy things differently

827
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,319
in a better way healthier way

828
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:35,200
the idea of just me uh being distracted

829
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,880
my entire life and

830
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,480
not enjoying the moment to me it's a

831
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:42,160
very terrifying

832
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,160
thing i would never want to do that

833
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,760
you can you can live a life where you're

834
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,440
just comfortable

835
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,640
with distracting yourself they are and

836
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:54,880
then your whole life flashes by

837
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,880
without any ever doing any reflection

838
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:01,839
not epic

839
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,520
i think that's why i hate these uh

840
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:09,200
youtube channels that uh

841
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:15,520

maximizing your uh

861
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,440

862
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,199
something good in

863
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,799
a middle ground there but when you see

864
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:00,640
these channels that are like i don't

865
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:03,759

things i do in a day from eight to nine

870
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,040
i do this and then from nine to ten i do

871
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,799
this and then

872
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,080
from 10 to 11 i do this and then i do

873
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,359

uh

877
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,000
i can't even explain why i hate it so

878
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:29,520
much i think because people

879
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,199
it's fun to watch in a way it's engaging

880
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,600
so you kind of get swept into it

881
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:36,239
but in reality i would hate to live a

882
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,239
life like that

883
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,560

884
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,560
you're

885
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,279
