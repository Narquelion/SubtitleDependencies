857
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:39,110
just

858
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:44,630
I know you would come back oh let's put

859
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:46,850
this on all right so this is the last

860
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:50,390
episode I know because I've been

861
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:53,420
speaking to Jack Jack said I will really

862
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:55,790
like the last episode you're the real

863
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:59,390
one because the real when it comes to

864
01:22:55,790 --> 01:23:00,440
singles you're a fake one I was I knew a

865
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:05,690
little lower

866
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:07,540
yeah of course of course how is that I

867
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:10,250
still don't know how to play this game

868
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:10,940
all right I think we're gonna see Gordon

869
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:13,400
Freeman

870
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:14,810
but that's my theory because that would

871
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,880
be cool right that would be a big

872
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:17,420
shocker because you never see Gordon

873
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,920
Freeman

874
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:22,340
but now you're in VR you're like up

875
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:25,010
close you actually get to like see him

876
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:27,740
touch his boobs but never not in front

877
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:29,540
of you of course all right this is my

878
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:31,340
theory of the ending what is gonna be I

879
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:34,910
don't know what do you think theories

880
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:37,520
that should the theory I'm too tall for

881
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:39,830
this game now I mean I'm always tall

882
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:46,750

01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:08,830
assume here I assume I may be up here

904
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:08,830

908
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:35,870
terminology all right so this looks like

909
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:37,310
a puzzle isn't it what are we looking at

910
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:40,070
here we're looking at a command station

911
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:42,560
down there and we're looking at some way

912
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:45,020

01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:45,510
then something else comes and kills you

1055
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:45,510

1175
01:48:19,219 --> 01:48:28,250
live give me enough time animal crossing

1176
01:48:22,630 --> 01:48:29,869
right everyone loves that game you know

1177
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:34,010
why because you're in your own little

1178
01:48:29,869 --> 01:48:37,909
area everyone gets their own space

1179
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:40,420
there's no industrial mechanism we're

1180
01:48:37,909 --> 01:48:44,280
all just happier

1181
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:44,280
we're all just happier in nature

1182
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:56,230
unconsciously or miss know what the word

1183
01:48:55,090 --> 01:49:00,610
is when you stumble upon something

1184
01:48:56,230 --> 01:49:02,920
without meaning to simulated exactly

1185
01:49:00,610 --> 01:49:06,070
what people want which isn't living in

1186
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:07,480
flats in big cities having day-to-day

1187
01:49:06,070 --> 01:49:09,160
jobs they just want to live in their own

1188
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:10,720
little house with enough space that

1189
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:12,190
there's still other people around

1190
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:16,120
hence the villagers so you don't feel

1191
01:49:12,190 --> 01:49:17,680
lonely but really you just want to live

1192
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:21,160
you're on your own well house in the

1193
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:22,870
forest because that's where we all

1194
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:26,770
belong and at the end of the day isn't

1195
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:28,750
it no one wants this huh are we happier

1196
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:31,150
because of all of this are we happier

1197
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:36,460
because of the latest iPhone I don't

1198
01:49:31,150 --> 01:49:37,960
think so it's temporary pleasures with

1199
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:40,810
living day to day in the happy world

1200
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:43,920
that's what we all really want do you

1201
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:47,050
understand me so Animal Crossing

1202
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:48,780
basically is the key to happiness is

1203
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:56,020
what I'm saying

1204
01:49:48,780 --> 01:50:01,380

1205
01:49:56,020 --> 01:50:01,380

the help and they really got to do me

1216
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:16,350
like this on an old man trying to plan

1217
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:22,350
game after band over in front of his

1218
01:51:16,350 --> 01:51:25,610
child yes it looks like you will be able

1219
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:25,610
to get into the vault from up there

1220
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:43,650
what's the security they dragged this

1221
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:49,910
area out so they can do that and text

1222
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:49,910
speech moments one really is annoying

1223
01:51:51,150 --> 01:52:01,510

you might even you know in the I guess

1231
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:26,740
my point was like in the future you know

1232
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:31,420
with VR that they're gonna make some

1233
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:32,920
sort of nature simulator that will make

1234
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:39,840
you feel like oh wow it's like I'm

1235
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:39,840
actually in nature know something about

1236
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:49,770
looks like the bridge is fully extended

1237
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,699
just need to gently dock the vault to

1238
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:55,530
the bridge

1239
01:52:50,699 --> 01:52:56,940
how far can that be oh that yes well one

1240
01:52:55,530 --> 01:53:05,600
of these has to bring in the vault for

1241
01:52:56,940 --> 01:53:07,830

extraordinary value a previous has been

1517
02:25:01,609 --> 02:25:12,140

well done guys good game I was really

1526
02:26:19,950 --> 02:26:29,010
fun fun game this gives me hope that

1527
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:31,681
there will be more VR games in the

1528
02:26:29,010 --> 02:26:33,750
future I think especially they will do a

1529
02:26:31,681 --> 02:26:37,710
full Gordon Freeman game I think that

1530
02:26:33,750 --> 02:26:39,570
would be really cool or maybe maybe

1531
02:26:37,710 --> 02:26:44,070
they'll work on a new IP with VR that

1532
02:26:39,570 --> 02:26:46,440
could be cool too to be honest because

1533
02:26:44,070 --> 02:26:47,580
that was just fun to play yeah yeah

1534
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:49,050
actually play the game and I got a

1535
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:50,851
decent workout it's not like a break a

1536
02:26:49,050 --> 02:26:53,160
sweat or anything but yeah at least I'm

1537
02:26:50,851 --> 02:26:54,980
not sitting still I think it's that I

1538
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:58,800
think that's really cool

1539
02:26:54,980 --> 02:27:00,150
cool way to enjoy a game escape from the

1540
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:04,021
world for a while especially in these

1541
02:27:00,150 --> 02:27:06,920
times I I really enjoyed this let's play

1542
02:27:04,021 --> 02:27:10,620
as well cuz I I just did what I wanted

1543
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:12,991
usually I try to be accommodating which

1544
02:27:10,620 --> 02:27:15,961
I think you should be but

1545
02:27:12,991 --> 02:27:18,421
I don't know I guess this one might took

1546
02:27:15,961 --> 02:27:21,001
more the way I would just play the game

1547
02:27:18,421 --> 02:27:25,531
myself which was fun just having fun

1548
02:27:21,001 --> 02:27:29,271
with it I think it was up there with

1549
02:27:25,531 --> 02:27:29,271
half-life 2 I don't think it was as good

1550
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:37,920
there were some parts but whatever it

1551
02:27:34,990 --> 02:27:37,920
was still dopest out

1552
02:27:39,391 --> 02:27:42,320

[Music]

1556
02:27:52,921 --> 02:27:56,121
for Jake

1557
02:27:58,040 --> 02:28:09,890
oh that's sweet anyway that's a Gordon

1558
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:34,690
Freeman reference gone Gordon wait up

1559
02:28:09,890 --> 02:28:34,690
Gordon she's gone Gordon she's gone yes

1560
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:46,280
because I was thinking it's kind of

1561
02:28:44,450 --> 02:28:48,470
strange how they don't have any Mele in

1562
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:50,900
this game especially being a Viera game

1563
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:56,210
I think that was deliberate for the

1564
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:59,380
crowbar in the next game okay cool

1565
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:59,380
that's it alright thanks guys
