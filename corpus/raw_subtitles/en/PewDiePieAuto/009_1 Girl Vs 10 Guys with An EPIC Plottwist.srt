00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,310
felt kind of a connection but after that

195
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,440
I just kind of it kind of went away a

196
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,419
little bit and then whoever the third

197
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,770
person was and it's cuz initially he

198
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,159
just immediately said he was bad at

199
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,610
planning

208
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:10,529
if someone's vocal just go on a date or

209
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,300
whatever

210
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:14,970
explaining who you really are how you

211
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,550
feel it goes very far in a relationship

212
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,980
I would say was the time Christian like

213
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,470
you know excessive drink how the hell is

214
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,750

215
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,640
fine like if it's excess yeah a little

216
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,720
bit hard the smoking and drinking thing

217
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,480

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,100
do ah

230
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:04,190
what would you say is like a really big

231
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,170
town of yours I guess I can sing but

232
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,600
like I'm not very confident with it oh

233
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,850
cool I mean I'm not like horrible but I

234
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:20,630
haven't really been public about it I

235
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:22,550
guess um okay I don't know who she's

236
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,839
gonna eliminate Tyler he was talking

237
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,649
about twerking oh yeah of course

238
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,420
of course but he also didn't seem like

239
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:33,740
he was very serious about a relationship

240
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:36,170
and then I'm gonna have to uh Caleb no

241
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,670
particular reason just wasn't really

242
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,870
feeling it anymore I guess

243
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,610
damn that's me hair gel guys still in it

244
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,470
I kind of wanted to win at this point I

245
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,420
want to be able to say that I can own a

246
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,790
house but hopefully by the time I'm 30

247
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,680
you know have my family set how many

248
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,630
kids do you want

249
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,399
hopefully by like a boy and a girl to be

250
00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:00,079
honest and then maybe like three or four

251
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:01,519
dogs so yeah with that oh yeah and I

252
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,680
want the boy to be a little older than

253
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,130
the girl see I want it the other way

254
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,690
around believe the boy oh my god for me

255
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,520
something that's really important I'm

256
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,350
trying to become a pilot and I've joined

257
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,579
the Navy to try and achieve that goal

258
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,380
and I'm still working there and that's

259
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:17,240
something I feel like for my partner I

260
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,100
want them to be the same mentality that

261
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,279
I'm in yeah too bad she's unemployed

262
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,690
okay if one person is motivated right

263
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,940
and the other person is doesn't really

264
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,339
care I've got a lot so I'm a musician

265
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,440
actor but I'm also studying political

266
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:34,160
science and I want to be President of

267
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,079
the night and you know being with

268
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,850
somebody that's like committed but also

269
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,970
like supportive and I can learn a lot

270
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,670
from them that that really means a lot

271
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,589
to me what about you I'm leaning towards

272
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,540
psychologists so I can help teens with

273
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:50,140
mental disorders and everything like

274
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,980
that there's a lot of I think genuine

275
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,440
connection and you really like care

276
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,750
about people you know because then you

277
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,279
can look beyond where they are and like

278
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,610
see them for who they truly can't be and

279
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,470
I think that's super special yeah okay

280
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,160
he's gonna win come on I'm cutting one

281
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,160

282
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:14,680
hair gel guy come on don't let him down

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:17,110
I'm just gonna have to cut off Sam brah

284
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,550
look at this dude she could probably

285
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,350
smell the hair gel through the car and

286
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,350
she's like oh no I'm getting a bit

287
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,850

288
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:33,760

here that's cool what about photography

300
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,940
I'm kind of curious about that would you

301
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,040
like portraits landscapes um my main

302
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,710
focus I guess you could say is portrait

303
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,720
um I love shooting animals as well like

304
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:11,230
wildlife yeah you love taking a photo of

305
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,840
me then haha so what's the hardest thing

306
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,820
that you've ever been through and how

307
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,730
did you get through it and how did it

308
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,380
affect damn what a deep question one of

309
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:24,310
the hardest things I've had to go

310
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,590
through was probably middle school

311
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,610
beginning of high school because I

312
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,900
struggled with a lot of depression and

313
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,820
self-confidence

314
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,100
I've overcame it by like I'm starting to

315
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,250
love myself I'm super outgoing and I

316
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,750
help people so helping people yeah Danny

317
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,670
that's amazing

318
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,380
I would definitely say like you have to

319
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,870
embrace who you are because it's unique

320
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,580
and what you bring to the world is

321
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:52,450
different than any other person any

322
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:55,180
other individual all right okay yeah

323
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,280

324
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,500

oh my god please I think I have a

327
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,790
decision do you guys know what's gonna

328
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,430
happen because I think I know Joseph

329
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,830
that last question that he asked me it

330
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,340
shows me that he can actually get really

331
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,020
deep when he needs to be

332
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,610

333
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,650
