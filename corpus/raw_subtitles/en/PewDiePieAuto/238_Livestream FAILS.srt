56
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,079
lesson don't defend a woman well of

57
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:19,900
course they don't

58
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:22,120
why the [ __ ] would they and then the

59
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:29,829
Sims come to add to the recipe she's an

60
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:33,750
attractive woman you know is the lack of

61
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:37,060
eye contact the lack of confidence the

62
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:43,390
posture that's all hit all three Synod

63
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:45,069
mommy I had all the eggs that I would be

64
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,210
so happy if you pulled out a monster any

65
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:48,850
during their that be

66
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,140
funny I mean that's funny III a mister

67
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,000
thought if he saw this he would just

68
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,850
like react like most people be like nope

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,920
keep it there at least like he has some

70
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:00,160
sort of self-awareness so I can't really

71
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,110
hate all night that's really funny

72
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,850
never defend the woman like what are you

73
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:08,140
them just kidding I'm joking by the way

74
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:10,300
it's a joke oh yes please

75
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,670
the content was removed by copper I

76
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,470
claim so I can't react to illinit II

77
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,220
getting bitten by her cat are you

78
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,990

80
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,150
oh wait the music is copyrighted that's

81
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,830
why isn't it at this point okay just

82
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:32,110
imagine the most horrific singing voice

83
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:34,450
of all time basically funny look at the

84
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,560
freaking it gets a huge pile of meat

85
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,960
dude look at that

86
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,810
look at that that's so much I can't even

87
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,870
I'm nice as this is the conclusion of

88
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,610
that illinit e versus cat saga it ended

89
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,470
with a happy ending and the internet was

90
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,660
satisfied that's so funny

91
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,310
there's so much simpler lated kannan

92
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,140
lately okay boomergirl

93
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,800
that did a tick-tock and everyone just

94
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,800
lost their mind

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:05,669
[Music]

96
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,150
internet lost their absolute mind

97
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,849
she has burned the shirt I guess I would

98
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,189
birdie now isn't he out of the race she

99
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:17,350
was a catalyst for the simple war simp

100
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,239
queen basically that's her new name so

101
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,130
basically what happened was this video

102
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,139
got viral you probably know this I'm so

103
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,919
late on this the video went viral is

104
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:26,500
funny though

105
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:31,960
and then people found out she had a

106
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:34,509
boyfriend and she lost like 60 K and

107
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,620
then she made a response saying that

108
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,849
it's okay to simp

109
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,199
maybe I haven't done this in a while

110
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:40,780
maybe this year and we'll see what the

111
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,690
biggest ones are whatever you say boomer

112
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,460
got damaged so catchy though realist

113
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:49,919
post match interview ever that was a

114
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,919
tough loss how do you feel after that

115
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:57,520
yeah it was a good game we had a good

116
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,780
opponents our team wasn't really that

117
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:07,330
strong this year but we'll come back

118
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:08,139
this time expected reaction I don't like

119
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,440
the loudmouth

120
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:13,270
scream it calls boyfriend shy getting

121
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,250
all the girls I'm guaranteeing you

122
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:45,849
there's at least one girl looking at you

123
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:49,690
even though you're the shy guy oh yeah

124
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:51,970
he's really shy that's funny she didn't

125
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,460
get chat is that it can I say giga chad

126
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,919
that's the name of the meme but can't a

127
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,509
might like to say it deadmau5 opinion on

128
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,509
tipping and streamers

129
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:44,930
I'm so controlling Oh No it's so awkward

130
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:47,419
now yeah it's kind of weird as a

131
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,039
streamer criticising tipping although I

132
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:51,169
know it's more complicated than that at

133
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,729
least in America because sometimes you

134
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:55,099
don't get a salary you just get tips

135
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:57,229
which is kind of like that should not be

136
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:58,610
legal I don't even know if it should

137
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,840
maybe it's good for people I don't know

138
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,000
how it works over there so I shouldn't

139
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,880
criticize it so these are like up in

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,840
Miami

141
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,340
going out actually watch this girl do

142
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,640

147
00:07:18,800 --> 00:08:06,490
