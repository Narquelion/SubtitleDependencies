all right gamers today we have a lot of

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,130
stuff to do first off I want to show

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,199
while I was desperately trying to find

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,660
the books we have two new friends two

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,380
new kitty cats so I just been keeping an

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,360
eye on them

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,100
Lulla bleep that I don't know what to

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,100
name the other one so you guys give me

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,840
names and all all top comment besides we

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,340
have you locked in place this guy is not

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,649
gonna change this profession because we

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,840
traded with him that's how this works we

22
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,960
have the freaking chamber which is not

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,300
working at all so we're gonna have to

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,350
redo it there's gonna be a couple

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,079
changes around here just for a brief

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,030
moment we're just gonna cover up this

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,799
window so no one else can see what's

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,110
happening just do it

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,950
just as minor detail no one needs to see

30
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:14,549
what happens in that's so weird everyone

31
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,590
just disappeared all the villagers well

32
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,470
no one could see it apparently villagers

33
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,290
gossip so if you hurt someone they'll

34
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,790
give you worse prices so that's lucky

35
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,610
that they just left and I didn't have to

36
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,670
hurt them why am I always full of stuff

37
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,759
every time I play it's like I don't know

38
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,110
what at okay so these two you lucky see

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,579
they already like each other this is

40
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,710
this is perfect

41
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,350
they're gonna be our new breeders you

42
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,229
guys are gonna be like Adam and Eve yes

43
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:47,070
see see now he's a normal villager I'm

44
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:50,130
taking no chances with you - you will

45
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,920
freak whether you like each other or not

46
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,890
this is gonna happen this is happening I

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,439
mean oh yeah I built that piggy statute

48
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,640
it does it we're doing it more important

49
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:05,369
things okay so here we are the idea is

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,330
that they're gonna stay here

51
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:12,330
I don't know if this works no one's

52
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,160
tested out freaking method then we're

53
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,560
gonna put this here this here and this

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,980
here and I'm gonna have to somehow get

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,620
them down there get in hole Oh perfect

56
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:29,190
no how am I gonna get both for them in

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:31,049
there come on come on oh closed this is

58
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,810
so romantic you will be together forever

59
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:36,120
you will populate an entire city think

60
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,430
about the consequence I will pay you I

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,739
won't pay you but I could you kick come

62
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,890
on you're why can't you stay in a hole I

63
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:49,019
don't ask for a lie yes yes ha ha ha

64
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:53,400
okay gamers they are stuck in the hole

65
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:55,829
of friction yeah we have Brad making

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,019
sure they actually do it you know for

67
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:59,340
moral support

68
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:02,099
now what we're gonna do is wooden plays

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,799
a dispenser that will make food fold

70
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:08,579
downs because they need food to frick

71
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,799
and I don't know how exactly look I

72
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:11,609
think they're already getting a Sorry

73
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,269
Sorry Sorry Sorry Sorry

74
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:18,350
I guess I'll wire it to go here so three

75
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:25,829
up and so we will place dispenser

76
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:29,230
looking down as such oh no I'm stuck in

77
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:35,129
friction BRR No

78
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:39,040
ah gotta push them down the Frick hole

79
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:42,340
pushing they lit Frick Hall I push my

80
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,379
boys down the Frick hole get down in the

81
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,060
hole get down Oh get down in the

82
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:49,980
get-down hole oh yeah get in the Frick

83
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,480
hole

84
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,220
absolutely stunning hey but it will I

85
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,799
know it's kind of silly to spend the

86
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,930
whole kiss time of this it will be worth

87
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:08,079
it trust me alright let's just put some

88
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:11,970
rotten flesh Annie works excellent let's

89
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,920
get all our favorite our finest potatoes

90
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,859
put them in the dispenser as search I

91
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,739
think I would prefer if he like goes

92
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:23,710
well oh sorry that's probably not good

93
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:28,320
right there we go ah I don't need to go

94
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:32,620
near you lose yes that's how I like it

95
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,050
I just want it to be like a total creep

96
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:40,260
in the ground now we can witness the

97
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,260
lovemaking sending the potatoes I

98
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:51,550
thought it would continuously send in

99
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:54,789
potatoes this is super annoying maybe I

100
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,460
need some sort of repeater okay so I

101
00:04:54,789 --> 00:05:01,539
need to figure out a way to make it

102
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:06,220
constant pulse it's going good right he

103
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:07,770
agrees okay so now signal is constantly

104
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,540
pulsing

105
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:14,710
this doesn't make any sense though like

106
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:19,600
how do I stop it oh I see if I sit right

107
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:21,640
maybe if I had a button then right no

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,160
that doesn't work it needs to be a

109
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:30,060
higher tic and just stop it

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:32,470
just click it again doesn't work at all

111
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:37,660
if I have a lever though I can just

112
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:41,040
brink and activate it to stop it this is

113
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,040
so dumb that it might just work

114
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:47,290
okay so I think I figured it out

115
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,570
because now we have a constant pulse

116
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,640
going and then we turn it on which is

117
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:55,650
technically off and then it's just a

118
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:59,230
constant flow which will make it stop

119
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:02,830
big brain let's try it out okay I think

120
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:06,460
I I think I did it man your redstone

121
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,440
engineers better watch out let's try it

122
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:18,460
out bread man

123
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:22,980
I heard it's working yeah when you

124
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:26,560
figure that redstone it feels so good

125
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:30,190
let the fricking begin that's right

126
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,400
enjoy those potatoes they're like what

127
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:37,150
is happening wise potato run from

128
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,770
ceiling don't worry don't worry he can't

129
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,190
see us for me they can't see us from

130
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,190
here

131
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,580
Macbeth back now we play the waiting

132
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:51,670
game let me actually let me clean it up

133
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,310
there I guess we have to just wait for

134
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:59,440
them to very well we shall wait in the

135
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:02,200
meantime I think it's dang time that I

136
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,150
start utilizing this mending thing maybe

137
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:09,310
I over evaluate it what the so we have

138
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,650
this badass Triton right that we really

139
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,600
want it we want to keep this but it will

140
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,940
break eventually I have an arrow in my

141
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,500
skull or our diamond sword yeah let's do

142
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,610
it on our diamond sword this would

143
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,550
probably cost a lot but it will

144
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:25,710
definitely be worth it so we put mending

145
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:30,460
on it and now hey something actually

146
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:33,940
spawned for the first time when we get

147
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:38,590
XP maybe try it on some people who-who I

148
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,730
think we can spare a couple you see that

149
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:46,330
you saw that on the sword

150
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:48,430
it went up sorry people for oh my god

151
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:52,380
they are already cooked the pork chop

152
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:57,130
because they burn oh that's so sad

153
00:07:52,380 --> 00:08:00,160
why am i laughing ah so the experience I

154
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,770
get from cheap chop chipping goes not to

155
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,750
me goes to the sword so sword lasts

156
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,230
forever now I won't level up though so

157
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,060
that's that's a problem I just keep

158
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,880
hearing them flipping and plopping but

159
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,950
no freaking and friction you know what I

160
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,980
mean I know I'm not supposed to be in

161
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,900
here but come on guys you gotta do me as

162
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,730
but I come back there better be a baby

163
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,300
that's all I'm saying I think it's safe

164
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,730
to say as disappointing as is this the

165
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,950
frickin machine doesn't work and I can't

166
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,480
figure out why maybe it has something to

167
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,330
do with the fact that their restraint

168
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:38,860
down there you know wow how many did

169
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,540
they spit out 64 guess you guys don't

170
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,460
like potatoes huh if you guys are

171
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,530
disappointed just imagine how I feel

172
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,120
alright maybe we should just go with a

173
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,650
more natural approach and just hope that

174
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,839
they do something

175
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,400
it's like you build someone a freak

176
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,550
chamber you think that I'd least be

177
00:08:51,400 --> 00:09:00,339
grateful
