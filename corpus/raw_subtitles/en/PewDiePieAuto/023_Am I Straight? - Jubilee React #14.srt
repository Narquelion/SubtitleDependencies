watching all of them say honestly now

because it changes but just from looking

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,119
i know that's the point is that you

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,360
can't tell by looking at someone

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,640
what their orientation is except if

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,799

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,320

[Music]

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,160
i know the point is that you can't judge

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,920
by their

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,080
okay my mom actually asked me when i

66
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,360
tried to tell her she basically took the

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
reins and she's like are you gay i'm

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,519
like

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,760
i was a little bit later so i kind of

70
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,000
hit it for a long time i was like 23.

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,840
it was like an anxiety round because

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
it's so short you can't really say

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,159
anything

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,280
so i was like let me say something so

75
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,959
then i'm not the one that doesn't say

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
anything before the round is over

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,920
i came out to my sisters when i was 17

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,519
and then i came out tomorrow when i was

79
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,239
21 because she found a cochrane in my

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,080
room

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,360
she found a what a [ __ ] running in his

82
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,440
room is that a metaphor

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,879
is that a gay metaphor or something she

84
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,879

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,280

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,239
that he's insane he's the gay i mean

88
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,920

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,200
there's no way what kind of man wears

92
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,920
shorts and

93
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,720

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,760
easy all right easy easy curveball i

104
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,840

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,120
cringe honestly cringe that they felt

106
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
for that he's so

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,560
obviously plus he's like he's got the

108
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,079
gay posture

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,000
look one two three oh maybe that's the

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,759
thing one two three four

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,840
maybe that's the gay posture to have it

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,080
behind

113
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,040
it's not me sometimes people tell me i'm

114
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,960
not i don't like

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
necessarily look gay or quote unquote

116
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,680
what people might assume

117
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,759
looks gay just like the long hair and

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,520
maybe the clothes just like very i

119
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,840
thought long hair was super gay sorry

120
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,040
dave but i honestly what

121
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,360

126
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,919
do a hybrid

127
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,520
okay let's do a hypothetical real quick

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,000
if we were all on a baseball team

129
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,840
would you consider yourself bruh if if

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
black james charles isn't gay i'll

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,560
believe anything

132
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,639
anything can be real i i believe in

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,199
ghosts now

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,759
a pitcher a catcher i'm a catcher

135
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,960
pitcher

136
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,120
okay what does yeah we we we know

137
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,560
black james charles we know you don't

138
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,199
have to say it like that you don't have

139
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
to say it

140
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,560
i'll do both yeah pitch and catch i want

141
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,560
to say yeah more of a catcher

142
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,680
okay see they can pick what they want to

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
do it's gotta be

144
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,479
so much more fun being gay it's not when

145
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,400
did everybody know that they were gay

146
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,840
and what age the birth literally my

147
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
birth literally i had a boyfriend like

148
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,280
kindergarten i

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,240
probably i believe you might do wait who

150
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,720
is this

151
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,160
oh he kind of flew under the radar then

152
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,240
he you could be

153
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,160
you could be there no oh my god yes

154
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,320
literally his name is christopher and we

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
kissed on the slide in like kindergarten

156
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,680
and i was like i'm gay

157
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,639
mine was really suppressed during high

158
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,880
school um

159
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,400
if no one knows i'm trans so i have two

160
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,919
coming out stories so that's very

161
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
difficult to come out to your parents

162
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,639
multiple times well yeah technically

163
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,479
that's a weird story to lie about

164
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,160
that's very specific all right i believe

165
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,400
you come out three times

166
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,160
one i thought i was a lesbian because i

167
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,319
was born a woman so i thought

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
okay that's the thing and then after

169
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,759
that i was like no

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,440
i'm trans so i had to come out again

171
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,560
after that and then

172
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,080
i was like yeah i'm gay too many times i

173
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,360
mean he had three times where he came

174
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,039
out which i get you can come

175
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,120
in you can go out you can come and go

176
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,840
out but i'm just like i don't know

177
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,080
that's way too many times

178
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
how do you just make that up he doesn't

179
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,280
believe

180
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,560
it was just so repressed because my dad

181
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,479
was super homophobic

182
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,840
and you know which happened a lot in the

183
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,600
black community so

184
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
it was one of those things where yes

185
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
super heavily protected and guarded

186
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,360
and then it just kind of came to a point

187
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
in my life where like i realized like

188
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,960
this is my life i need to

189
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
you know do something for myself and not

190
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,560
live in that fear

191
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,840
so of course i ran away to san francisco

192
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,800
and and that kind of helped me like

193
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,680
accept it more

194
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
damn you forget about that i think the

195
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
the

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
the thing with coming out as gay it's

197
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,599
like uh a lot of people and i think my

198
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,360
approach a few years ago as well was

199
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,599
like oh it shouldn't matter

200
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,520
just uh it shouldn't be a big thing who

201
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,039
cares and i i still want to believe that

202
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,080
but at the same time there's clearly so

203
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,240
much homophobia

204
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,680
you see it everywhere online since

205
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
you're not surrounded by it you kind of

206
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,800
forget that it

207
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,280
it does exist so it's important to

208
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,840
remember and not just brush away

209
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
i don't know i don't know i was bullied

210
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,120
in high school for being gay

211
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,560
well i suppressed mine so yeah i know i

212
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,880
was dodging that bullying i'm not gonna

213
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
lie

214
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,440
i was getting bullied it'd be kind of

215
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,039
weird to come in here and like make up a

216
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,680
bunch of stories about how

217
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,280

218
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,280
be like actually i'm straight like

220
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,800
saying like i was gay but they're like

221
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,240

time and i thought maybe he was kind of

245
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,800
using that to kind of like trick us all

246
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,880
into thinking he was like a beyonce fan

247
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,320
so i was just like let me get him out

cry

271
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,959

especially where you're going out

402
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,600
