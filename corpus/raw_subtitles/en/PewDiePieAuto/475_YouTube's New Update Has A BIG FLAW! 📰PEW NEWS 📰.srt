you has told us that we need to do a

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,360
better job preventing harassment on

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:43,230
YouTube doubt doubt I'm pressing the X

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,289
it's a big X here we consulted with a

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,090
wide array of creator style experts and

12
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,219
organizations to update a harassment

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,239
policy which changed today doubt here's

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,070
what it covers all right well let's read

15
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,660
through this let's break this down the

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,600
official blog let's go through it

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,980
doesn't matter the thing that I've

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,840
learned about YouTube's policies is that

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,000
it doesn't matter what they say what

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,250
matters is how they enforce it and we've

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,990
already seen how it's done they may they

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,060
change this harassment policy their

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,030
first move their first order of business

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,950
apparently was to remove idubbbz leafy

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,930
content cup that was it thank God they

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,619
updated the policy so they can get rid

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,869
of this video finally what if you read

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,939
the blog post it says beyond threatening

29
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,420
someone there is also demeaning language

30
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:38,000
that goes too far too far idubbbz too

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,340
far when I dub said chin small too far

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,380
it's so stupid

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,780
apparently allegedly leafy himself has

34
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,060
said that this is complete bogus his

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,340
whole channel leafy himself is made of

36
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,979
criticizing other channels come back

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,649
leafy come back we miss you we need you

38
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,290
diet we're in dire need over here heel

39
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,420
knee first of all why retroactive Lee

40
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,329
takes down videos if you're gonna make a

41
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,119
new policy change then go from there

42
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,869
don't go back in in old videos to say

43
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,870
actually this one this one bad what is

44
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,650
that fix reading more in this blog post

45
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,840
it's

46
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,250
clear that they made this as a response

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,939
to what happened earlier this year

48
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:23,569
between steven crowder and that vox guy

49
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:26,489
and Crowder was poking fun of his

50
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:28,500
homosexual mannerisms which I will not

51
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:31,290
replicate because whenever I think about

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,299
it I just can't believe anyone would do

53
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,310
that I'm joking of course we'll get more

54
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:36,750
into that harassment hurts our community

55
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,060
by making people less inclined to share

56
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,530
their opinion and engage with each other

57
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,290
we heard this from time and time again

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:46,139
from creators this does the opposite

59
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,090
YouTube creators are [ __ ] degenerates

60
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:51,510
they're the worst people out there

61
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,870
speaking from a youtuber we pull the

62
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,750
worst imaginable just to get views on

63
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,359
this side that's how we get paid thus

64
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,579
far yes I use that word the only thing

65
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:05,939
keeping these YouTube vultures in check

66
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:08,400
are other youtubers we have this anarchy

67
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,980
system okay and don't come and ruin it

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,260
for us YouTube the rule is if you do

69
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,040
dumb [ __ ] on YouTube you will get called

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,560
out on it

71
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,780
we need that it's the only thing keeping

72
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,290
us sane YouTube don't take it away from

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,019
us please a couple examples and this is

74
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,319
just a handful daddio five making videos

75
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:30,510
abusing children his own kids or step

76
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,250
kids I don't know was it YouTube that

77
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,260
strike down those videos was a YouTube

78
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,930
that took the first step in action to

79
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,090
make sure something happened there no no

80
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,129
it was other youtubers guess they can

81
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,379
just flag them down for bullying now the

82
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,599
same tactics is used I'm not gonna name

83
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,370
the scumbags name but it's same tactics

84
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,949
is used right now we're another

85
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,620
degenerate creator is getting criticized

86
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:54,840
by other youtubers the way the tactic he

87
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,669
uses to strike it down is to copy strike

88
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,250
those videos so he gets the money from

89
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:02,099
those creators now you're just giving

90
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,069
more tools to these scumbags to strike

91
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:07,049
down criticism Logan Paul showed a video

92
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,959
with a a [ __ ] dead body

93
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:12,810
a corpse it wasn't removed by YouTube no

94
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,639
no no no no no it was removed by Logan

95
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,250
after other people criticized him

96
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,049
promoting gambling to kids did YouTube

97
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,630
do anything about that no [ __ ] you know

98
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:23,940
it was other creators that notice it and

99
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,950
called it out making videos milking

100
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,350
people's reason

101
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,750
passing our YouTube gonna addict policy

102
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,700
for that because previous leads

103
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,140
youtubers telling people to not do these

104
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,240
things and otherwise they would get away

105
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,860
with it if YouTube know what's good at

106
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,420
them they'll keep their [ __ ] hands

107
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,590
out of this well-developed

108
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:44,870
100 percent unclog system where you dumb

109
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,000
you get called out that's just how it is

110
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,220
I don't dumb [ __ ] to I get called out

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,320
it's epic it's not epic actually but

112
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,240
it's good it's good for everyone

113
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,920
further on they say we've always removed

114
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,600
videos that explicitly threatened

115
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,820
someone reveal confidential information

116
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,130
and encourage people to harass someone

117
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,980
moving forward our policy will go and

118
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,590
step further and not only prohibit

119
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,110
explicit threats but also implied

120
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,300
threats we don't want to be dumb fury

121
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,520
enough so we're gonna dump three some

122
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,520
more we're gonna go a step further on

123
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,960
our dumb finish Bucky implied threats I

124
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,300
think it's really good because YouTube

125
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,320
100% knows the intent of people the

126
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,850
video called

127
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,920
and why they censored the thumbnail

128
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,350
because it was just completely horrible

129
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,640
it's called the death of HD HD it was a

130
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,950
video criticizing a straight street

131
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,990
whatever your opinion on the video is it

132
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,600
got removed and I think it was because

133
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,580
he was holding a gun towards h3h3 in the

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,240
in the thumbnail I think I think that's

135
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,240
how I remember it

136
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,920
eh trees it's scared for his safety

137
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,810
because today that video needed to be

138
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,940
gone I mean everyone knew a she or she

139
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,040
was in big trouble because of his

140
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,470
personal safety thanks to that thumbnail

141
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,450
I mean my god what do we have done no

142
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,850
one thinks he's going to shoot a tree

143
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,130
tree just cuz he holds up a gun no one

144
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,500
is fearing for a safety why are you

145
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,170
doing that why is there no distinction

146
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,990
between intent and actual action it's

147
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:11,120
not that hard to tell in a part in

148
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,980
English so I asked you to provide this

149
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,870
cuz I was kind of worried where they're

150
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,080
gonna draw the distinction and they said

151
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,300
that this tracks will fall under

152
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,520
artistic content and scripted comedy and

153
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,100
sanap is fine but you can't abuse the

154
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,410
artistic content as an excuse to keep

155
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,640
harassing someone a lot of people raise

156
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,010
the question I've seen other youtubers

157
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,920
being like okay so why can't late-night

158
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,420
show hosts you know make fun of Donald

159
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,280
Trump as an example because they're

160
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,810
pretty relentless with it to a point

161
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,000
where it just stop being funny years

162
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,919
ago but apparently it's an American

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,950
media rule this is just what I've heard

164
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:48,980
that says that you can ridicule public

165
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:51,160
figures that's fine thank God thank God

166
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,720
public figures are still up to ridicule

167
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,639
aren't we old public figures on YouTube

168
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,980
isn't that the point like this doesn't

169
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,440
make sense to me why do they get a pass

170
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,660
and some don't it seems very selective

171
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,460
if someone understands explain to me I

172
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,070
don't understand this it should be the

173
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,200
same and to summarize this I think it

174
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,940
seems the same case for a lot of

175
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,919
YouTube's update where the intention is

176
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,630
good I don't think people should get

177
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,400
attacked for their sexual identity or

178
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,380
but it's always like this is what we

179
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,330
want to strike down and then all these

180
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,669
other things and consequences is the

181
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,960
result of it and I don't understand how

182
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:25,970
that happens every time

183
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,400
it's like hopper wasn't enough there's

184
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,710
no kids content or YouTube and there's

185
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,950
no edgy content anymore on YouTube but

186
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:38,990
what we have here encapsulated it's very

187
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:41,870
nice very nice mmm delicious stale

188
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:45,789
content tastes so stale mmm

189
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:49,160
lights are coaching little big things

190
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:53,150
it's so boring but it's so media

191
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,830
friendly poppies Moorea from the future

192
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,360
here I don't have time to record this

193
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,650
but I wanted to make an update on the

194
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,450
whole cough less situation that I

195
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,550
covered last week for those of you don't

196
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,190
know now as a creator you have to tag

197
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,960
your video if it's made for kids or if

198
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,030
it isn't and there's a lot of confusion

199
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,370
based on what is family-friendly then or

200
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,560
what is made for kids and it's still

201
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,289
pretty unclear but hopefully we'll get

202
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,840
more update question mark where the

203
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:19,880
distinction is we sold ready that a lot

204
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,070
of channels were flying that's for kids

205
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,750
when they clearly were not and I got

206
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,639
really upset about it because I think

207
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,820
it's [ __ ] that YouTube besides and

208
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,919
then they're wrong when you could lose

209
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,560
up to 90 percent of your revenue but

210
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:37,459
according to what I've heard it's closer

211
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,409
to 60% okay it still sucks but the main

212
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:41,419
issue I'm making this update is because

213
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,070
because even if YouTube tag your video

214
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,320
ass made for kids

215
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,080
you can still remove that tag it's not

216
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,880
like a branding mating I don't know iron

217
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,980
fork or something you can still remove

218
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,250
it it doesn't matter what matters is

219
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,110
that you

220
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,090
make your own distinction if your

221
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,190
content is made for kids or not and the

222
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,080
fine that is quoted for the two thousand

223
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,900
from the FTC if you make it an issue is

224
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,280
only if you're a big youtuber and I'm

225
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,920
the one that's gonna get that fine if

226
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,540
your smaller youtuber and you happen to

227
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,160
get fine which seems unlikely because

228
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,040
they're not just gonna go over after the

229
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,330
bigger ones first anyway so it's still

230
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,780
very frustrating and it's still very

231
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,940
annoying but it's not as panic mode as

232
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,050
it seems at least that's what I gathered

233
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,540
from it so I just wanted to update you

234
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,670
