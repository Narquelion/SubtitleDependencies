1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
we thought the war was over oh how wrong

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,779
we were

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:12,090
there's been another threat lurking in

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:15,929
the shadows in plain sight I'm talking

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,510

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,619

8
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:26,250
everyone is looking at the wrong channel

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,820
we were looking at the wrong channel his

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,740
family

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,740
so guys drumroll please

12
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,800
that's right guys it's called Coco melon

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,809
you guys probably never heard of it

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,269
before this channel has much less

15
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,070
subscribers than pewdiepie and t-series

16
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:46,620
true how do you think it will catch up

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,769
well wait till I show you the views and

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,649
subs this channel is getting every day

19
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:55,860
ok guys so look Jesus Christ as many

20
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,769
views every single day 69 million views

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,799
a day bruh that's the broad number and

22
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:03,690
it's a kid's channel you will not get

23
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,080
away with this actually that's pretty

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,390
epic

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,679
good job Coco melon good job if you

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,179
compare that to PewDiePie you'll see

27
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:14,729
getting a similar amount of subscribers

28
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:16,770
and views per day than t-series is

29
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,770
getting this past month the channel

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,539
increased its views by 20 percent

31
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:25,890
whereas t-series is only up by less than

32
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:27,210
1% if my math is correct then and 14

33
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,090
months of this channel will pass

34
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,450
PewDiePie and t-series so that wait how

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:38,159

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:41,430
83 million oh no they can't keep getting

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,399
away with it t-series piece we need to

38
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,469
join forces to defeat this evil they're

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,719
gonna take over both of us unless we

40
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:53,219
join forces I am joking of course but

41
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,259
still a my Indian nursery rhymes with a

42
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,719
bit sprinkle of PewDiePie will be

43
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,539
unstoppable what is it that Coco melon

44
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,490
does that makes them so goddamn popular

45
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:04,590
if you look at their channel it's pretty

46
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,710
incredible not gonna lie

47
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,679
their most popular videos almost ten of

48
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,410
them have over a billion a billion

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,900
how is that even possible let's check

50
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,160
out all the boxes that Coco melon hits

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,650
nightmare fuel check I can do that cyber

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,230
added something creepy a minute mark in

53
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,060
the corner for parents that don't can't

54
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,660
figure out how to read the bottom of the

55
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,370
corner let's put it a bigger on alright

56
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,070
gotcha sigh put it in the thumbnail

57
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,040
actually sigh put it in the corner right

58
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,950
now actually sigh inflate the numbers a

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,010
little bit oh yeah insight increase

60
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,720
saturation of this video oh yeah we're

61
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,120
already gaining subscribers and

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,890
as we speak I've been doing it wrong

63
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,830
I've been doing it wrong all this time

64
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,130
but what is coca melons videos what is

65
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,930
it that makes it to Park Valley I cannot

66
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,010
say that number without screaming Jesus

67
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,380
Christ dude

68
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,210
just in perspective how many people live

69
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,740
in the earth like nine billion do I got

70
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,510
that right

71
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,870
7.5 I'd even know and they managed to

72
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,030
get more views on 10 videos than the

73
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,420
population of the earth that's not bad

74
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,300
that's not bad a slight threat but they

75
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,880
have not won yet okay remember two

76
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,980
Orion's toy review I crushed him

77
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,010
everyone was like he's gonna take over

78
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,960
people I smashed him his channel not I

79
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,260
would never hit the child unless I have

80
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,750
to

81
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,420

82
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,730
child cuckoo melon we need to get in the

83
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,240

85
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,260
Coco melon I feel like I'm doing the

86
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,870
same thing here where I'm literally just

87
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,210
making really dumb an ironic jokes

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,860
against a company but we've already seen

89
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,100
how that went so I'm not going down that

90
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,390
road again

91
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,910

92
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,310
classics this one is called I want to be

93
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,020
like mommy and immediately a pattern

94
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,640
that I've noticed on all Coco melon

95
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,520
videos is that they get a ton of

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,160
dislikes which is very confusing no

97
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,440
matter how many views on a video that is

98
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,940
always a ton of dislike what a baby is

99
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,390
clicking dislikes on these videos long

100
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,220
laugh this video this video sucks mom I

101
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,020
don't want to be like mommy at all just

102
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,400
like if they're getting this many

103
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,930
dislike what are they getting somebody

104
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,680
views video bad I just like it now how

105
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,250

131
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:20,870

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,250
and they're not I know the answer and

193
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,920
the answer is just like kids I mean

194
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,540
parents just put the an iPad or

195
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,190
something in front of the kids don't put

196
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,740
on YouTube clearly that's the thing but

197
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,190
so many do they not have kids channels
