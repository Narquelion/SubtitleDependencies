born goddamn alright SpaceX memes gets a

68
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:52,680
solid three thank God for something else

69
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,470
happening can something happen can we

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,090
get some good memes I I didn't want to

71
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,760
point this out but I think it's pretty

72
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:03,900
clear lack of a meme review videos

73
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:05,760
equals lack of memes lack of clapping

74
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,069
seriously that's been so few means

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,829
lately the best one I think is for sure

76
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,950
is that the buff dog meme which is

77
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:16,259
basically a combination of beta and Chad

78
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,690
meme combined with the haha goes bitter

79
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,250
just two simple things contrasting each

80
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,449
other I don't know why I'm explaining

81
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,240
the meme it's so [ __ ] obnoxious

82
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:26,460
anyway rejected people in 2012 I would

83
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,860
go to the gym and improve my personality

84
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,220
to make my crush fall for me reject

85
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,669
people in 2020 I am the best I'm gonna

86
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,770
make a meme right now you can do both

87
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:40,289
it's possible hey guys stop looking down

88
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,510

89
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:44,070

somewhere too meemers now no it's

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,440
another thing I don't like me with good

95
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,539

96
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,360

97
00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:03,630
first graffitis that was a that was ever

98
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,210
made and it was literally I think it was

99
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,669
originated from soldiers but then people

100
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,530
started appropriating it and writing it

101
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:11,909
everywhere so it got really confusing

102
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,229
like who is Kilroy and why is he

103
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:16,979
everywhere

104
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:19,289
