26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,479

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,600

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,600
big deal but i i didn't like the way i

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,799

if you get a bad one you'll become a

157
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,960
philosopher

158
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,000

socrates said or not

163
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,199
which is a very convenient thing to

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,039
bring up whenever you disagree with

165
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,039
something he said

166
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,080

171
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,840
besides it's a disgrace to grow old

172
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,360
through sheer carelessness before seeing

173
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,280
what matter of a man you may become by

174
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,440
developing your bodily strength

175
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,039
and beauty to their highest limit but

176
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,960
you cannot see that if you are

177
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,120
careless for it will not come on its own

178
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,080
