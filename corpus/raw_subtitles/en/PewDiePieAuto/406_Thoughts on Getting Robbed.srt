00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
a few months ago our house is broken

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,060
into no one was at home at the time when

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,370
it happened but it was surprising to

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,290
find out nonetheless the word about the

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,360
breaking got around quickly as news

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,370
articles covered the event most people

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,509
were very supportive of course but a few

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,630
people in the Internet

9
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,949
took the news as a chance to celebrate

10
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,810
rationalizing it as since I have wealth

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,460
and having to replace some items in my

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,789
home it's just a minor inconvenience

13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,560
really for once a reaction about me was

14
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,109
made completely without my influence

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
another irony is that nothing was stolen

16
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,910
from the break-in at least personally

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,829
even my two most valuable items my

18
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,989
camera and computer were left whatever

19
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,870
they took was from my wife unfortunately

20
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,760
I had previously been decluttering in my

21
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,219
house but now I finally shifted to a new

22
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,530
gear I got rid of anything I didn't want

23
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,270
ton of items that I only kept because I

24
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,390
didn't want anyone else to have them or

25
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,829
at least take them like awards all items

26
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,870
that had barely any sentimentality

27
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,300
things I had stored away never to

28
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,629
actually be used if any item lacked

29
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,790
value or utility I sold donated or just

30
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,950
got rid of it at the same time I was

31
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,380
reading about Diogenes the ancient Greek

32
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,119
philosopher who only lived with one item

33
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,850
in his possession which was a wooden

34
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,040
bowl even this he got rid of on the day

35
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,590
when he saw a peasant boy drinking water

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,840
by cupping his hands he tossed the ball

37
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,790
away and said fool that I am to have

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,220
been carrying this superfluous baggage

39
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,710
all this time there are many stories

40
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,780
about Diogenes some seemed too great to

41
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,820
be true but I'm glad to know he at least

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,130
lived you can find him on old paintings

43
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,549
which depicts him living in a barrel tub

44
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,049
or most commonly a large urine if you

45
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,640
know about Diogenes you most likely

46
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,159
already know of his famous encounter

47
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,750
with Alexander the Great Alexander had

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,570
heard about their journeys philosophy

49
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,939
and was personally intrigued by him so

50
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,180
one day he stuck out Diogenes who was

51
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,770
relaxing on a field in the Morning Sun

52
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,140
Alexander as Diogenes if there's any

53
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,530
favor he could do for him he would do it

54
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,479
by our journeys then replied yes by

55
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,110
moving away since you were covering the

56
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,629
Sun Alexander declared shortly after if

57
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,819
I wasn't Alexander then I wish to be

58
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:14,070
Diogenes this is such a perfect example

59
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,200
of two extremes meeting each

60
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,540
I think the fact that Alexander the

61
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,360
world Lord who had reached more status

62
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,580
wealth and power than anyone in his time

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,130
could have ever dreamed up still felt

64
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,320
humbled by their journeys a man who had

65
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,090
seemingly nothing coming to this

66
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,980
conclusion he must have realized that

67
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,560
the things we value actually carries

68
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,360
little satisfaction on its own and all

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,240
the things Alexander had done others

70
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,490
wanted meant nothing to Diogenes in my

71
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,440
own experience what little notoriety and

72
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,510
wealth I have is still far greater than

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,520
anything I could have dreamed up but the

74
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,650
experience itself feels like it can be

75
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,290
compared to an HG part of your body that

76
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,700
is too far away to reach you want to

77
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,370
scratch it to see what it would feel

78
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,230
like to get rid of in the fantasy and

79
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,870
the idea is always there of the pleasure

80
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,030
and satisfaction it could give you until

81
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,920
you finally managed to reach for it the

82
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,890
sensation fades quickly and you're left

83
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,990
the same Diogenes had nothing Alexander

84
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,930
had everything but only one of them were

85
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,790
truly free what was Diogenes philosophy

86
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,160
that even Alexander the Great became so

87
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,660
interested in it Diogenes defined and

88
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,940
was considered one of the founders of

89
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,700
cynicism this word doesn't have the same

90
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,500
meaning then as today cynic meant dog or

91
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,060
dog like which was likely said to

92
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,880
ridicule Diogenes and his strange

93
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,560
behaviors he however took his name on

94
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,540
his self because he actually praised the

95
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,820
dog and its virtues despite it being

96
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,190
used as an insult

97
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,410
Diogenes didn't recognize Society and by

98
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,570
doing so he considered himself above it

99
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,190
he therefore didn't believe in shame and

100
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,290
would do almost anything a dog would do

101
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,450
in public he would be seen sitting on

102
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,730
the street if people insulted him he

103
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,130
would respond by urinating on them it

104
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,130
would be seen masturbating in public the

105
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,600
list goes on a dog lives at ease they

106
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,420
don't think about the past or the future

107
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,290
they live only according to nature just

108
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,170
like Diogenes

109
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,450
despite his obscene actions Diogenes was

110
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,920
still a philosopher but unlike many of

111
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,440
his peers he didn't recognize

112
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,150
metaphysical ideas since to him they are

113
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,150
a waste of time and a distraction from

114
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,950
the moment by our journeys even had many

115
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,230
famous encounter with one of my favorite

116
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,180
philosophers Plato these stories are

117
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,250
also really great he read for example

118
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,830
she himself during Plato's lectures just

119
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,120
to distract the lesson but my favorite

120
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,650
story is there

121
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,830
one of Plato's lectures he was

122
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,449
discussing the metaphysical ideal forms

123
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,970
Plato said that all things have a pure

124
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,440
essence each thing has a form that

125
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,510
defines their true being

126
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,729
Diogenes who didn't like metaphysical

127
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,160
ideas challenge Plato and pointed

128
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:46,710
towards a cup on a table what about this

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,220
cup he said is there an eternal perfect

130
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,290
cup somewhere later responded yes in

131
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,990
fact the cup can take many different

132
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,990
forms but there is a perfect form of cup

133
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,150
Ness that resides inside your head then

134
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,449
he supposedly insulted Diogenes on his

135
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,490
simple-minded take of his complex ideas

136
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,740
Diogenes then responded what about the

137
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,810
emptiness inside the cup is there a

138
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,199
perfect form of emptiness that exists as

139
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,660
well

140
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,699
Plato pause for a moment to think but

141
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,830
before he got to answer the our journeys

142
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,510
pointed to Plato's head and said I think

143
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,050
you'll find it's in here where the

144
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,500
emptiness resides finally about Diogenes

145
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,090
death

146
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,340
there isn't much confirmed about this

147
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,320
either some people say he got poisoned

148
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,960
by eating raw meat others insist

149
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,180
strongly that Diogenes died one day when

150
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,030
he decided to hold his own breath

151
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,010
Diogenes final wish wasn't for a proper

152
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,229
burial but rather to be thrown over the

153
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,780
gates of the city to have the rodents

154
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:44,550
and animals feast on his body as a way

155
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,010
for him to give back to the earth when

156
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,660
he had taken from it Diogenes throughout

157
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,090
history has often referred to as

158
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,280
Socrates gone man their minds were very

159
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,780
different but they both share is that

160
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,990
neither of them wrote down their own

161
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,430
ideas they lived them instead I don't

162
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,530
think you'll see me living in a barrel

163
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,780
any time soon but I think there's a lot

164
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,610
to learn from Diogenes I find it funny

165
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,110
how I lost more items reading about him

166
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,110
than actually getting robbed did
