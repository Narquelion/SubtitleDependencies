keep it going oh that was the whole

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,440

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,640
scale of one to ten it's about a seven

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,120
it's too scarily similar i don't like it

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,200
he just needed to end on that like

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,879

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,200

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,159
that's what he did

85
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,360
okay because he can't actually do your

86
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,040
voice yeah that's a good that's a good

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
point he had to mess around with you

88
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,480

all the blooper reels that i have

117
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,320
i feel like if you just do that like

118
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,560
that's half your impression

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,000
yeah it's so distinct all you have to do

120
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
is match the energy level and then you

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
have

122
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,160
oh okay is that how you do it you're

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
just like

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,120
how quickly can you get it on and off

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,120
like do you have to

126
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
no don't do that you scare me

127
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,919
it used to be different and then i took

128
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,680
an open pitch up and up and up and then

129
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,360
i hit this note that i hit every single

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,880
time oh

131
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,520
it wasn't intended i just got really

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,960
annoying damn i respect that you do the

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,440
same pitch every time though

134
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,120

so weird

197
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,120
it's like before i even started making

198
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,400
videos i don't wonder why i did the

199
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,160
laughing one like

200
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,919
how's it going perhaps i don't know

201
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
let's go back to the speech coach

202
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,520
yeah he's doing that that makes it more

203
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
endearing it opens up the video

204
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,360
immediately

205
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,240
i thought it was like oh it's kind of

206
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,039
friendly to laugh in the beginning like

207
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,360
maybe you're just faking enthusiasm if i

208
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,720
laugh then people will think i'm happy

209
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,160
no no that's not how it worked at all

210
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,160
i remember actually do thinking like

211
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
yeah if i force a little happiness then

212
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,000
at least it will make other people happy

213
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,360

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,040
vpn gets seventy percent off a

373
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,920
three-year

374
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,120
i get it that's all you gotta do so he's

375
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,800
doing he's doing the last thing

376
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,399
holy we exposed him oh my god

377
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,760
how do i make an ad read interesting

378
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
they're really boring i have to read the

379
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,760
script

380
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,000
laughs how do i force charisma

381
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,680
isn't that channel charisma on command

382
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,240
yeah that breaks down people like that

383
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,320
oh really

384
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,000
and if you just do that see if you got

385
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
hyper analytical i'd love to see

386
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,839
like a human analyst look at youtubers

387
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,600
and be like oh my god

388
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,040
they're all sociopaths what's wrong with

389
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,800
all of them

390
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,639
because it's the thing that people react

391
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,240
to right and then they react to it more

392
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,399
and more so you kind of just

393
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,920
that just becomes what you do because

394
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,279
that's the positive things people leave

395
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,880
on your videos being like oh i like when

396
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,680
it yells oh right yeah it's a lot of

397
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,320
energy

398
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,199
so then i just yell more yeah and then

399
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,720
you get into that

400
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,240
no one starts off yelling damn it no

401
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,079

yeah it's just the thing i've noticed

455
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,319
that everyone's impressions is that

456
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,520
they're afraid to get really loud uh

457
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,439
either they're not able to because their

458
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
neighbors will kill them or that makes

459
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,760
sense

460
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,919
they just are afraid they'll cringe at

461
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,480
themselves if they get that loud

462
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,079
there's a there's a level of of cringe

463
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,000
if you don't try hard enough

464
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,120
