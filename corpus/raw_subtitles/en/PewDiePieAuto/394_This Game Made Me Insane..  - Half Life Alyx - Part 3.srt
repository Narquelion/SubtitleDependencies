I forgot how I saw these

232
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,240

234
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:14,799
there it is nice god damn I'm gonna

235
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:18,200
puzzles

236
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:24,739
it's almost like I'm a puzzle God huh so

237
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,460
gone I'll put my shouting laser sight

238
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:28,399
okay

239
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,200
yes I will definitely get laser sight

240
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:31,929
unless I can get LASIK eye for my gun

241
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,700
because I think that's more useful

242
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:38,239
reflex sight ads display the highlights

243
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:40,159
tactical targets burst fire bullet

244
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:43,279
reservoir laser sight maybe I should

245
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,259
save up for laser sight because shotgun

246
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,629
doesn't really work unless you're close

247
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:55,279
range anyway I think I'm gonna save my

248
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:56,599
resin I know I'm crazy like that I don't

249
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,129
know I want laser sight for my gun I

250
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:03,649
think that's the most important because

251
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:04,099
like looking through doesn't really work

252
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:10,339
for me

253
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:11,679
