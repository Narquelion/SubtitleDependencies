wasn't going to live up to the

17
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,890
expectations we didn't read yet know

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,680
what Sonic was going to look like what

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,409
would the size of his peepee be a lot of

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,260
question still unanswered their words of

21
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,510
course a couple fan versions that looked

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,210
very promising people had great ideas

23
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,759
great expectations and great hope for

24
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,790
Sonic this looks pretty good that looks

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,040
like my fan art alright but without

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,979
further ado we do have a live first

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,460

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,300
finally they did it finally a decent

33
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,580
Sonic

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,260
I wasn't sure with all the fan stuff

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,110
that it was gonna live up to the

36
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,030
expectations but this I like this I like

37
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,490
this a lot and I could see what they

38
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,700
went through here they went with a mix

39
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,070
of futuristic style but still capturing

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,080
the nostalgia of the old fans thank you

41
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,260
Paramount Pictures for doing sonic

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,020
justice excuse me we're getting live

43
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,480
reports now saying that that's not the

44
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:31,590
real footage money this guy I can't

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:33,360
believe it let's watch why do they play

46
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,880
oh god what is said why does he have

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,890
human teeth why would you do that what

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,180
is thanks it's just some sort of sick

49
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:45,209
joke he says Christ that's my reaction

50
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,660
and why is no one talking about the fact

51
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,910
that here he came like dodge missiles in

52
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,190
real time but for some reason he can't

53
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,350
dodge an arrow to the freaking knee Oh

54
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,269
arrow to the knee I get it that's good

55
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,540
that's good that's a really good joke

56
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:02,640
this shot of Jim Carrey in the end made

57
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,650
it look cool I think I read somewhere so

58
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,590
it's a pretty legit source I think I

59
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,600
read a comment somewhere that's we only

60
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,519
look for the motard hitting evidence

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,160
here on Pew News saying that this is

62
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,670
just a post credit see very disappointed

63
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,040
and so was a lot of people it has

64
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:23,340
500,000 dislikes and I think people just

65
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,350
have had enough Jeff Fowler the director

66
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,660
of producer I don't know tweeted out

67
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,910
saying thank you for support and the

68
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,070
criticism the message is loud and clear

69
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,079
you aren't happy with the design and you

70
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,299
want changes it's going to happen

71
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:39,030
everyone at Paramount and say I don't

72
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,860
think everyone ok and Sega are fully

73
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,180
committed to making this character the

74
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,180
best he can be

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,810
hashtag sonic movie got a fix fast you

76
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,190

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,040
dead and we killed him

78
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,500
there is however one man one man who can

79
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,480
save us all from the suffering because

80
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,480
he's been carrying that suffering

81
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:07,500
yes four years

82
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,930
Sammy the Frick is the only one that can

83
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,209
save Sonic he's been trying to warn us

84
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,730
he tried to tell us for so long

85
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,820
I mean even myself I've been advocating

86
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,280
for fixing on saving Sonic for years I

87
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,700

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,000
this I have a feeling it's gonna be a

94
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,760
great meme review episode I prefer the

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,020
real sonic I said the real one I said

96
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,900
the real one I mean this version what

97
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,320
every better this mark should have been

98
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,540
better

99
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,700
hey Paramount Pictures I heard that

100
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,360
you're looking for a new Sonic and what

101
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,560
can I say

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,410
I'm your whamon I can do it next for

103
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,479
those of you who some reason don't know

104
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,000
ethica he's a streamer and I featured

105
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,490
him many times on my channel so guys

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,150
what I did was this is my calculator

107
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:19,760
right gonna open it and I'll chicken 1 1

108
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,760
3 & 4 and when I turned around

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,200
most people know I took a freeze over

110
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:31,380
the top reactions and he's become a very

111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,650
popular live streamer but if you go and

112
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,990
ethicist twitter it's just it's a lot of

113
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,900
nonsense I don't I don't know what's

114
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,370
happening I read this wrong using Phil I

115
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,310
thought I think I would go on dr. Phil

116
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,560
that would be something anyway and take

117
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,890
a live stream in himself on Instagram

118
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,100
and someone called the police and he

119
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:55,269
live through me

120
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,269
[Music]

121
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,119
[Music]

122
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:14,720
okay okay okay it's girls who went on

123
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,699
team stars show drama learn pretty

124
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,930
relevant I never heard of it I know but

125
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:19,699
what would you say to them are you

126
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,710
actually crazy are you having a mental

127
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:24,910
breakdown like the cops took you to the

128
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:29,979
the mental place today what happened

129
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:35,060
yeah I went I became God and I walk out

130
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:36,919
that's amazing that's amazing I think I

131
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,479
also delivered probably the favorite

132
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,820
line I've heard in a very very long time

133
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,210
they can do exactly what they've been

134
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:49,250
doing dreamy creamy creamy just watch

135
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:53,120
dreamy creamy creamy dreamy creamy

136
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,220
creamy so okay how did the all this

137
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,289
happen I don't know and I'm not gonna

138
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:01,010
try and force some oh it's so hard to be

139
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:03,530
a streamer and youtuber but he did lose

140
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,630
his youtube account because I think he's

141
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:08,270
streamed porn and then he lost his

142
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,190
twitch account or no the order I don't

143
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,320
think it's important but he lost his he

144
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,870
got banned from twitch because he used

145
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,630
to slur it's kind of odd that there's no

146
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,250
to give kind of attitude but it's also

147
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,530
pretty clear that he's going through a

148
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,050
public breakdown I think anyone can see

149
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,699
that and it seems very similar to what

150
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,400
we've seen before kind of like with

151
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,440
fouseytube last year when he did pooja

152
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,060
Khan and it was all about I'm doing all

153
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,190
these great things I don't know anything

154
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,289
my psychology and I don't know anything

155
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,110
about etiquette but this is just how I

156
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,520
interpret the situation but it seems to

157
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,250
me that it took a needs help and I think

158
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,380
that's clear to anyone except himself

159
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,970
and I know a lot of people are upset

160
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,889
with that decay because this is a

161
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:52,699
repeated pattern that he does apparently

162
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:54,500
and people just wanted to get help and

163
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,360
they know even if they support him then

164
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,969
that won't happen everyone is just

165
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,070
trying different things to get him to

166
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:02,380
actually get help but the thing is you

167
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,850
can only get help if

168
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,310
want to get help and I think it's

169
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,080
important that to get realizes that and

170
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,760
I want people to share that sentiment

171
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,640
with him to make sure that he actually

172
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,530
does and I actually respect that to get

173
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,850
a lot but I would respect him a lot more

174
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:20,770
if he actually did

175
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:23,200
next news Susan which has been in hot

176
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,790
water after a leaked footage I never

177
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,150
thought I would say these words a leaked

178
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:53,830
footage of Susan Wojcicki talking to

179
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:56,230
Jews world let's watch so this was taken

180
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,060
from the whole jumper but I don't know

181
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,100
exactly it's a live stream or something

182
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,170
like that don't care but a lot of people

183
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,360
interpret Susan saying we're gonna help

184
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,510
you we're gonna make your subscribers go

185
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,520
way up as in YouTube being kind of

186
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,310
rigged against creators Jews world

187
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,040
obviously he isn't a youtuber he's a

188
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,360
musician it costs a lot of uproar I

189
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,490
don't think she knew she was being

190
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,160
filmed a lot of people saying like Oh

191
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,710
smaller channels are being screwed yada

192
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,510
yada yada I don't really see it that way

193
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,880
personally I think I'm not supposed to

194
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,830
give him but it seems more to me like

195
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,930
this is CEO talk where you try and

196
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,660
butter someone up it's obviously good

197
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,550
for YouTube if an artist like juice

198
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,320
world is on it okay we're artists in

199
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,260
general it's better for the ecosystem

200
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,580
this kind of taught it I don't think it

201
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,700
means anything I don't think she's gonna

202
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,140
go out and do like change the system to

203
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,090
help Jews world I don't think that

204
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,590
that's not what it meant here but a lot

205
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,080
of people are interpreting them that way

206
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:56,170
I just think it's amazing how it Susan

207
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,080
gets to meet Jews world why don't I get

208
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,390
to meet you swirl I can't believe both

209
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,500
me and Susan listen to angsty teenage

210
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,370
emo brat

211
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:09,670
hell yeah Susan also posted her update

212
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,890
April 30th creator blog where she

213
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,070
followed up on a lot of promises saying

214
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,350
about supporting creator artists

215
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,060
and artist success she talked about

216
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,790
meeting with a lot of creators which

217
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,190
we've seen wait she met Ethan Mila I

218
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:26,820
didn't see that and she linked their

219
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:29,040
second channel I guess that makes sense

220
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,680
she talks about how they added the self

221
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,960
rating system where creators to themself

222
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,730
can rate the video whether its

223
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,860
advertising friendly or not and the

224
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,200
thousand channels have it right now your

225
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,690
boy and it works really well and I think

226
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,850
this changes the point that a lot of

227
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,760
people made with the whole ad pocalypse

228
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,250
where there were a few bad videos from

229
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,810
these really I don't even know what kind

230
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,090
of channels there were but the whole I'm

231
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,310
pocalypse an area started with ads and

232
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,800
white supremacist content you know how

233
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:01,200
those specific videos can affect

234
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,150
everyone on the platform it's just kind

235
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,980
of ridiculous if you think about it so

236
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:09,630
to have youtubers that upload regularly

237
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:12,330
that doesn't do any bad things that it's

238
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,100
100% advertiser friendly and doesn't

239
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,110
swear in these videos anymore and it's

240
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,930
just a good rural overall boy in general

241
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,420
and hasn't had any controversy in over a

242
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,790
week now and I think those people are

243
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,820
doesn't deserve to get lower ads okay

244
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,380
but that's just my opinion I think it's

245
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,030
a step in the right direction and I'm

246
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,400
glad it's happening they also say that

247
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,290
they improve the precision by 25 percent

248
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,660
she also talks about the trending tab

249
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,450
and they're saying that they are gonna

250
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,700
work on having it half creators and or

251
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,920
at least half will be actual creators on

252
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,230
the trending tab so the trending was

253
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,630
rigged all along I knew it no she

254
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,760
actually explained what I thought for a

255
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,520
long time which was a lot of times a

256
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,980
very popular video of mine will not go

257
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,350
on trending and it's just like why Wow

258
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,660
why not like but the reason why is if

259
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,690
all my popular videos got on trending I

260
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,070
would always be I'm trending and just

261
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,050
take over the trending tab and no one

262
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,970
would like that either so it's basically

263
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,190
measured in comparison to my other

264
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,930
videos if one really shoots up that

265
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,450
video gets trending but if my all my

266
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,820
videos are always doing well then

267
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,630
there's nothing to stand out from and I

268
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,850
think a lot of people have a

269
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,800
misconception about that they look at

270
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,540
the view number and they're like well

271
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,430
this video has this many views and this

272
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,360
video is solo abuse why is why is this

273
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,220
one not trending and then

274
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,220
one trending that makes no sense at all

275
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,899
but maybe this is channel that's always

276
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,360
you can't even see how low I'm pointing

277
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,130
right now but then they get like BAM and

278
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,399
then electronic trending and then I was

279
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:44,160
like I would and I think this is just as

280
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,050
a game theory but I think a lot of

281
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,459
companies obviously don't upload videos

282
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,709
that often and then maybe they have a

283
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:51,990
trailer for some dumb schmuck

284
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:53,490
bukka video and I will the sudden I get

285
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,680
some more attention so they're like Oh a

286
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,779
trending Oh even though it's just a

287
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,390
company and it's BS and like screw you

288
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,470
Iggy Azalea like I don't like you and

289
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,200
that's why

290
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,149
so when creators upload frequently and

291
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,829
actually work on YouTube and Carib I

292
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:09,510
than YouTube they don't get trending

293
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:12,180
because they don't upload videos that

294
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,370
shoots up so therefore it's always just

295
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,200
a bunch of mumbo jumbo flung bush mambo

296
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:20,720
and i think i've spoken pretty

297
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,720
eloquently hear about the trending tab

298
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,310
