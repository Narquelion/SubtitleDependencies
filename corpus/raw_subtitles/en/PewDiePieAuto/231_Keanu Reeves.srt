00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:23,019
even here how old is he is over 50 and

45
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:29,829
the paparazzi referred to him as young

46
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:32,320
man that's right young man I know you

47
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:34,570
turned 50 last month an unhappy birthday

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,489

49
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,610
madam maybe I'm getting older or you're

50
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:44,230

51
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,760
never he does Nate number 3 Keano has a

52
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,160
very sad paced

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,560
sad Keanu was a meme that appeared a few

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,530
years ago before meme review was a thing

55
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,720
what there were memes before meme review

56
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,269
what the Freak this was in the era of

57
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,340
memes where people just found a picture

58
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,140
they thought was funny and everyone just

59
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,660
photoshopped it that was really it I

60
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,940
look how many counters look how sad he

61
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,720
is next to sad panda legends say that

62
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:13,450
Keanu is still sitting and still sad

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:17,669
sipping that JPL when I was digging on

64
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:19,430
the web about you I came across this

65
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:22,400
about you

66
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,829
this phenomenon the sad Keanu oh gosh it

67
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,030
was a couple years ago yeah oh man where

68
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,219
people picking fights with you sitting

69
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,859
on a bench eating a sandwich looking a

70
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:33,290
little bit sad and it became like this

71
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:36,980
crazy thing on the internet what do you

72
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,870
think about sort of media attention yeah

73
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:47,900
I don't know I didn't think of that as

74
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:50,030
media attention he was funny people

75
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,230
worried about your welfare um no I think

76
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,139
that's lovely

77
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:57,680
but oh the I think it was people started

78
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:59,900
to do funny things with that sad Keanu

79
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,879
obviously side account it was a meme or

80
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,889
whatever but it doesn't work in a way

81
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,349
because he ah no does have a sad past

82
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,989
there's his clip on Facebook that adds a

83
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:10,390
hundred million views talking about

84
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:27,529
Keano sad past

85
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:27,529
[Music]

86
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,760
you

87
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,690
you

88
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:49,360
[Music]

89
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:52,209
so apparently Keanu was born in Lebanon

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,229
okay how many people watch me from

91
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:59,860
Lebanon and his father is half Hawaiian

92
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:02,050
and his name Keano means cool breeze on

93
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,580
a mountain I don't know if that's true

94
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,770
but that's what he says

95
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,669
Keanu is such an exotic name but that is

96
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,709
your real name

97
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:13,689
yes sir that is my name yes is it from

98
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:20,110
Hawaii yes it's a Hawaiian name and it

99
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:21,879
means cool breeze over the mountains is

100
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,449
there anything about this guy that isn't

101
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,749
cool

102
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:27,519
god damn it Sookie oh no leads clearly

103
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:29,860
suffered through a lot it's almost like

104
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,749
people fetishize his past in a way like

105
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,389
oh he's been through so much and a lot

106
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:37,209
of it is kind of exaggerated as well but

107
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:39,699
I think what's important is that yes

108
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:41,800
he's gone through a lot but he hasn't

109
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,839
let that define him or destroy him and

110
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,360
that's what him is impressive about it

111
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,389
number four am i counting correctly his

112
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,089
lung okay I looked into his interviews

113
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:56,709
and I found this clip and it's so

114
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:58,569
bizarre but Sandra Bullock she so that

115
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:00,550
was her first big break with you yeah

116
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,360
and I asked her because everybody had a

117
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,180
crush on you

118
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,569
if she had a crush on you then and this

119
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:12,369
is what she said I think how sweet Keanu

120
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:14,139
Reeves was and how it was really it was

121
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:17,579
hard for me to like really be serious

122
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:17,579
like he would look at me and I'd be like

123
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,639
never dated really there was just

124
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,639
something about me

125
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,979
not sure I think it's true no he never

126
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,410
you never intimidated not at all

127
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,669
yeah there's nothing to intimidate I'm

128
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,840
not that yes you are

129
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:35,539
but we're but I think we're probably

130
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:42,060
friends for that long because we didn't

131
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:44,039
yeah right is that how you do it that's

132
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,490
how I maybe that's why he didn't want to

133
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,490
be with you

134
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,090
and it is reacting to that click look

135
00:06:52,100 --> 00:07:00,860
how happy is obviously didn't know I had

136
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:02,510
a crush on her oh I can't believe you

137
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:07,970
both had crushes on each other and you

138
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:09,200
you were so scared okay well I know I

139
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,060
mean you ever had a romance with

140
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,060
somebody that you did a movie with um

141
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:21,830
sounds like yes I mean whether it's

142
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,850
whether it's before or after I mean if

143
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,040
you wait until it's over

144
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,080
sure yeah but that's so that so that

145
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,190
chemistry was real because he all really

146
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:35,120
did both have feelings like that yeah it

147
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:37,310

149
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:43,570

150
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,460

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,610
the interview of him talking about

161
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,850

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:44,070
be springtime Jordan company

167
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:49,240

169
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,380
that the thing that's cool about this

170
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,700
film I mean it's cast really very well

171
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:02,200

172
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:05,560
know she's she's brought a very you know

173
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,000
she's been fighting the the this the

174
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:15,960
direction of just being like you know

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,960
they complete damsel in distress okay

176
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:30,580
how do you do not make a move on her

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:33,850
Keanu Jesus Christ my god well all of

178
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:36,550
this aside pass and the non happening

179
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,840
romance this is what led Keano into just

180
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:43,420
becoming social class when Kioto acts as

181
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:46,060
John wick he is John wick okay in every

182
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,760

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,860
training for John wick that love story

184
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,110
movie he's still John wick okay he just

185
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,360
gotta he's clearly such a badass and

186
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,160
have such intense respect for his craft

187
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,380
got a reefs really well

188
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,510
that's funny you can tell Keanu really

189
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,970
cares about giving you an experience

190
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,620
that is special in the film and actually

191
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,870
putting the work and effort into making

192
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,210
that happen he does all the action

193
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:16,090
himself or at least as much as he can I

194
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:20,560
love movies gosh I love movies I love

195
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:23,290
watching them and I love making them and

196
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,240
this brings up to the number 5 which is

197
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,570
Keanu and money there's this question

198
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,450
movies have made so much money three and

199
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,010
a half billion dollars entertain

200
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,400
entertain right yes that's right that's

201
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,010
right

202
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,870
everyone is so obsessed with money

203
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:40,750
apparently it was reported that he

204
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,940
donated 80 million of his 114 million

205
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,490
earnings from the Matrix sequels I

206
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,880
looked around it doesn't seem like it's

207
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:51,100
100% true but he definitely is a very

208
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,200
giving person he has donated a lot a lot

209
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,030
of money and he has also said himself

210
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,890
that money doesn't mean anything to me I

211
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,810
made a lot of money but I want to enjoy

212
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,400
life and not stress myself building my

213
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,590
bank account I give a lots of way and

214
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,240
live simply mostly out of a suitcase in

215
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,800
hotels we all know that good health is

216
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,900
much more important and I think that is

217
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,400
an important distinction of how you look

218
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,200
at the world and how you look at money

219
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,960
and I and I really really respect that

220
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,240
then coming to number five the point

221
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,720
number five is counter Rives and public

222
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,480
when he did the matrix it became such a

223
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,300
smash hit success that people were

224
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,130
obsessed with this film inevitably Keanu

225
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,380
Reeves who is the main star of the film

226
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,720
I found this quote in an interview where

227
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,210
he talks about the matrix becoming a

228
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,980
cult hit and he says he was asked about

229
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,990
the film and it was he surprised that it

230
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,090
became big and he says yes somewhat I

231
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,790
want to make something clear I am NOT

232
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,920
Jesus I am also no prophet or lone

233
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,080
fighter that will save the world

234
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,030
I find it frightening how many people

235
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,610
believe that being acquainted with me

236
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:54,100
would solve their personal problems

237
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,260
that's simply not so but I'm

238
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,480
participating in the next two Matrix

239
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,390
films with enthusiasm I don't know if

240
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,160
he's joking or not or if this is how his

241
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,680
life was actually changed that people

242
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,140
looked at up to him as some Messiah I

243
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,720
could be reading into this wrong but it

244
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,670
is interesting with the kion Owen and

245
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,920
and the public you know there was his

246
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,920
viral clip of him being in the subway

247
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,130
by the way you're not slick when you're

248
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,410
sitting there with your camera like this

249
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,410
is this is how you look like by the way

250
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,920
he clearly just want to live his life

251
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,800
like everyone else and I I can't relate

252
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,710
to that in a lot of ways but when you're

253
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,990
that famous this is inevitable that

254
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,920
paparazzi and living in LA you get

255
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,170
recognized

256
00:12:48,920 --> 00:13:01,520
look how hidden he is we will still find

257
00:12:51,170 --> 00:13:03,560
him look how many cameras you know that

258
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,420
moment when your bike doesn't start it's

259
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,900
a bit frustrating imagine being that

260
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,230
situation with a dozen cameras pointing

261
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,230
at you

262
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,590
and some guy across the street choked it

263
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,090
you need to choke them but yeah it's

264
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,090
like okay got it

265
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,080
god what an awful situation like if you

266
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,790
don't get the bike running what do you

267
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,720
do you're just gonna be stuck there with

268
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:50,410
all the cameras

269
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:50,410
there's my nightmare oh yeah

270
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:58,150
who was that that was John wick he's

271
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,460
also very nice with fans which I do

272
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,460
appreciate taking selfies

273
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,579
please you're one of my favorite doubt

274
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:25,950
[Music]

275
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:27,810
oh you might imagine you're flying

276
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,950
across the country you're tired you just

277
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:34,680
want to go home and then you may with

278
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:37,110
which leads me to the final point

279
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,830
stop asking Keanu Reeves for pictures

280
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,510
okay

281
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,880
I'm sure and listen I want to speak for

282
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,070
him I'm sure he doesn't mind but I feel

283
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,930
like I'm speaking through Keanu he just

284
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,120
want to live normally and not be stopped

285
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:51,030
every moment okay this is what Keanu

286
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,530
Reeves woods okay anyhow after this

287
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,690
video went viral where he says you're

288
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,040
breathtaking the guy that yelled you're

289
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,650
breathtaking from the audience was

290
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,300
offered the game to get it early and he

291
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,130
said no thank you

292
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,320
I would rather if you donate to charity

293
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,540
instead so in the spirit of Keanu Reeves

294
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,880
and making this video I wanted to donate

295
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,280
all the profit that this video makes to

296
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,930
the leukemia Research Foundation it's

297
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,150
working on her donated a lot of money

298
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,540
because his sister went through leukemia

299
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:20,040
she survived it took my granddad and I

300
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,340
thought that could be a nice ending to

301
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,620
it and have a nice Keano effect of doing

302
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,540
something good I know everyone once

303
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,700
ochio Reeves he should be how should me

304
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,860

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,320
