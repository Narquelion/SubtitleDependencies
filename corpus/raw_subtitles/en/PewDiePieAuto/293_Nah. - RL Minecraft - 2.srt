feel less worthless as a human being in

129
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:10,360
real life when my fake online character

130
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,590
is better at least I can improve that

131
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,260
myself

132
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,720
I don't like improving myself I think

133
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:20,700
I'll stick to my fictional video game

134
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,740
character that will be fun for maybe

135
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,930
sorry gamers was that too real for you I

136
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,240
used to be so addicted to World of

137
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,550
Warcraft I mean everyone was that game

138
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,290
was drugs but it comes to time in

139
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,419
everyone's life gamers where you got to

140
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:37,840
realize am I having fun or am I just

141
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,520
wasting time for me was what I had maxed

142
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,800
out my World of Warcraft characters like

143
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,900
you could literally not improve anything

144
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,880
of it it had the best ring it had the

145
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,010
best trinket and had the best everything

146
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,380
and I have just like perfected it and I

147
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:55,060
would spend time like maximizing my

148
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,920
skillset and what the hell is this ah me

149
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,260
