peer-to-peer file-sharing Network in the

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,050
world

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,539
powered by Tron blockchain which means

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,059
it has over 100 million users damn

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,500
that's almost as many as I had this

23
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,359

life and that's a good time baby one of

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,900
the reasons I joined the alive is

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,760
because their mission is to not take any

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,320
of the streamers earnings and that's how

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,970
they support streamers in a huge way

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,710
ever since I joined them they develop a

33
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,210
ton of cool new features and it's been

34
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,640
really nice to watch it grow and deal

35
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,580
I've actually rewards you guys for

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,500
engaging with craters which others sites

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,990
don't do that and get this they also

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,509
have sticker feature sticker feature

39
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,250
which makes it even more interactive to

40
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,000
engage with streamer but yeah that's

41
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,560

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,329

reddit review I like how everyone just

you've accepted it yeah this is just

47
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,159
part of the channel now today we're

48
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,130
reviewing [ __ ] design which it says

49
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,689
bad design but meant to freak you over

50
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,220
which is the worst kind

51
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,890
that's like the most passive-aggressive

52
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,810
way to fly went over this actually makes

53
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,780
me want to be a designer just to mess

54
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,250
with people there's so much bad design

55
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,590
people don't understand how important

56
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,329
design is okay youtuber gets every

57
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,489
single video on his channel copyright

58
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,009
claim despite having the rights to all

59
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,590
the music in his videos mumbo jumbo

60
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,920
mambo jump I loved his outro it was so

61
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,620
good

62
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,810
good this is so sad well it was based on

63
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,330
one small sample that was part of his

64
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,850
outro right that was the issue it's so

65
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,440
moronic that it blows my mind problem

66
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,350
here is in YouTube the problem is the

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,370
music industry what you use two seconds

68
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,140
of our clip that's mine mine the whole

69
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,990
YouTube video that has nothing to do

70
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,250
with it it blows my mind God and when I

71
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,350
think about I guess so angry

72
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,170
stop it Felix stop it the stranger thing

73
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,690
season 1 blu-ray has an unskipable ad

74
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:56,850
for season 2 that contains season 1

75
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:59,340
spoilers what the blu-ray why is that so

76
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,489
funny thank you for buying season 1

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,800
now buy season 2 government you owe as

78
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,010
money it's called taxes how much do I

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,350
owe

80
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,470
government you have to figure that out

81
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,110
me I just pay what I want government or

82
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,600
no we know exactly how much you owe but

83
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,820
you have to guess that number to me what

84
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,690
if I get to rock you got a present what

85
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,720
blows my mind

86
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,570
here in UK's I have to pay be 80 and via

87
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,880
T is based on I don't even know it like

88
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,519
when you sell step right or buy stuff or

89
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,500
higher stuff I generally it's just me or

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,750
I have the simplest business of all time

91
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,489
it's just me recording videos I don't

92
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,980
have that many driver new streams it's

93
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,720
not that complicated but still

94
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,329
government makes an estimate of v80

95
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,250
saying okay based on your income you

96
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,840
probably have to pay this amount in v80

97
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,090
which is pretty large amount of money

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,900
it's like 20 percent or something but

99
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,810
surprise surprise

100
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,700
I never have any v80 costs or taxes

101
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,470
because that's not how my business is

102
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,780
run but I still have to pay in advance

103
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,390
this estimate that the government wants

104
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,340
me to pay and if I forget to pay it or

105
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,470
if I don't pay it in time they charge

106
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,170
you 20 percent of that amount

107
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,730
it's a [ __ ] scam like it's not taxes

108
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,370
it's just a way to trick people into

109
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,980
paying money it's like a parking tickets

110
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,660
and [ __ ] I don't understand Arviat he is

111
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,280
it's a goods and service tax yeah

112
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,919
government we think you're gonna have to

113
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,019
pay this hundreds and thousands and v80

114
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,120
even though historically your business

115
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,260
never needs to pay it but we still want

116
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,730
you to pay it and then we'll

117
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,100
you back the money but if you don't pay

118
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,990
us in time we'll charge you 20 percent

119
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,000
of that amount because shame on you

120
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,960
because apparently you don't tax enough

121
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,940
yeah I get it

122
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,550
rich person complains about taxes it's a

123
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,830
cliche but it it is so dumb that it

124
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,250
makes me angry petition to change the

125
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,840
logo of this sub I gotta say despite

126
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,760
removing the headphone jack and how

127
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,890
stupid and annoying that was at first

128
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,510
now it's kind of like well I guess I

129
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,070
didn't really need it did I know that

130
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,560
you have wireless headphones as a

131
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,690
standard right it's like oh actually

132
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,850
it's quite nice to not have cables

133
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,710
everywhere even though I loose these all

134
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,600
the time it's freakin annoying Wow

135
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:08,280
McDonald's now blocks out the entire

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:12,450
menu to show a emitter so great design

137
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,160
makes it really easy so great here's a

138
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:18,180

332
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,440
what the a FedEx do is they're usually

there's a charge for the package right

334
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,890
there's a tax for whatever reason they

335
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,260
got two packs the package even though

336
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,060
it's a gift technically or samples they

337
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,680
got a tax it well what they do is they

338
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,270
don't charge you or they don't ask you

339
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,150
to pay they just send a letter saying

340
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,100
you have to pay us for what what package

341
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:25,330

349
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,920

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,300
I use for TV and Netflix I'm currently

363
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,130
eight hundred plus miles from home

364
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,350
thanks for ruining one of my few

365
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,480
luxuries I have on the road Hulu what

366
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,280
you're not supposed to are you supposed

367
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,030
to drive and watch

368
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:21,190
I think Hulu saved your life to unlock

369
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:24,910
open hoola when you're at home do this

370
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:26,860
at least every 30 days why get out just

371
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,450
don't use Hulu then this is why it's

372
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,890
good that we have different services

373
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,829
even though it is kind of annoying how

374
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,920
many there

375
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:36,680
stop using it they'll stop pulling all

376
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:45,439
right log democracy literal hell for

377
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:47,089
budget Flyers standing seats oh wow man

378
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:49,790
the thing is like you see so many

379
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:51,860
airlines going bankrupt anyway so I

380
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,600
don't know what their margins are or

381
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,370
because generally people don't care

382
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,529
right they just want to fly cheap as

383
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,480
possible so if consumers can fly more

384
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:01,399
cheaply and this is the option I'm sure

385
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,709
people would do it plus it doesn't look

386
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,959
like you're standing you can still sit

387
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:08,420
right I'm kind of confused by this

388
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,139
I need more context the packaging on

389
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,600
this drink

390
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:19,279
oh is it only like half full the bottom

391
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:20,209
is is like yeah yeah there it is that's

392
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,519
hilarious

393
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:25,040
although the weights to alright here's

394
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:27,829
why this one's bill is five dollars

395
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,600
higher you got a discount I'm not sure

396
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:31,639
Verizon understands the meaning of

397
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,519
discount how does this things happen

398
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:38,149
like American mobile companies to seem

399
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,399
insane Microsoft games create a new

400
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:43,879
process every time it plays an ad so we

401
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,800
can blast it at full volume she says I

402
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,870
was trying avocados for the first time

403
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,889
turn out some genius put a rock in it to

404
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:56,629
make it look bigger

405
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:58,790
what oh sorry they're joking got it that

406
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,040
will be rotten if that's the case my god

407
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,620
I'm stupid I can't buy single-use

408
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,789
plastic bags at the supermarket anymore

409
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:09,470
but companies get away like this I mean

410
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:11,480
to be fair how would they package that

411
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,959
so people can find it right and not

412
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,370
steal it to be fair however the fact

413
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,409
that you can't use plastic bags

414
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,419
supermarkets just freakin annoying but

415
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:22,399
does not help anyone I think I heard

416
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:24,860
that plastic bag was a Swedish invention

417
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:27,140
there were went at it in Sweden and

418
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,730
there was a way to waste less paper

419
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,039
because they were stronger than paper

420
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,780
bags so the idea was that you can keep

421
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,460
using them and recycle them and just put

422
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,770
them in your pocket and then use them

423
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,360
again and and the thing with the cotton

424
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,980
bags is that they produce some what they

425
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,049
take so much water to produce cotton

426
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,800
that you're doing much more harm to the

427
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,750
environment

428
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,700
getting a cotton bag unless you reuse it

429
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,220
like what 600 times or something like

430
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,530
that instead of of just using the

431
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,450
plastic bags a couple more times that's

432
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,700
right I am so broke I understand

433
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,350
