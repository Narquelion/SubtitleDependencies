33
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:27,260

34
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:29,030

53
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,750
simple

54
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,000

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,590

every year and this is what they look

88
00:05:43,310 --> 00:06:19,820
like ok news anchor in my lucky hat fat

89
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,160
I can't contain myself it's too funny

90
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,680
yeah it is kind of wholesome but still

91
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,690
this humour in America this is what

get my $1 charity money I don't think so

95
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,419
inmates went live and someone try to

96
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,320
threaten them with her jail time this

97
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,320
was their response

98
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,110
yeah I heard that

99
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:48,059
everywhere in jail they have cell phones

100
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,830
it's just a thing they just sneak them

101
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:52,649
in how do they keep sneaking stuff in

102
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,669
what who's paying the bill I have so

103
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:56,159
many questions

104
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,770
isn't that point of jail to be in jail

105
00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:06,199

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,159
some people can't take a dad joke

124
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,229
it looks like frost but it's spider

125
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:26,369
season in Australia burn the whole

126
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:28,409
country Oh God oh my bad alright well

127
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:30,209
now we know who did it at least now we

128
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:32,729
can stop him from doing it again

129
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:34,529
if you do win an award tonight don't use

130
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,990
it as a platform to make a political

131
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:39,149
speech right I saw the addition to the

132
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,430
public about anything you know nothing

133
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:43,019
about the real world most of you spent

134
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,470
less time in school than Greta thumb

135
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,070
burg so if you

136
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:51,660
I come up exceptionally an award faint

137
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:53,440
your agent and your God did he just

138
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,020
disrespect my queen

139
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,720
how dare you I feel like this clip was a

140
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,460
lot funnier because they showed Tim what

141
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,260
is the name Tim Cook Apple CEOs face

142
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:08,050
there is like he's literally sitting

143
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:13,180
there made by a company that runs

144
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:15,850
sweatshops in China so okay a couple

145
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,170
things like it's funny right I like this

146
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,820
don't get me wrong

147
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,550
second of all is this is not the fourth

148
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,140
time he hosts the Golden Globe and the

149
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,820
first time he's like I'm never gonna do

150
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,680
this again so like I might as well just

151
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,840
go all-in and that was the whole premise

152
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,340
that's why it was funny because he knew

153
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,380
he was never gonna be able to do it

154
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,510
again here is the fourth time doing the

155
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,400
exact same stick saying oh this is the

156
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,660
actual last time so now I can go all out

157
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,160
sicko mode

158
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,660
are you telling me seriously you never

159
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,610
bought any product that has been

160
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,080
producing China and this is coming for

161
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,030
someone you know me and Marcie we have

162
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,250
our brand Suki where we we produce

163
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,080
ethically in Canada because we want to

164
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,330
avoid sweatshops and obviously there are

165
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,310
legitimate factories in China it's not

166
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,430
like it's all terrible I have something

167
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,650
in my throat my point is what I find in

168
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,420
general is that people don't care where

169
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,490
their product come from and unless

170
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,710
people start caring where their product

171
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,960
are produced then you can't really call

172
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,210
out people like Tim Cook even though I

173
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,010
do agree it's [ __ ] obnoxious hearing

174
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,750
this Hollywood elite preach about a

175
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,820
bunch of [ __ ] because it is tone-deaf I

176
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,710
agree but at the same time I don't

177
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,660
necessarily think his argument really

178
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,250
holds up just wanted to put that out

179
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,870
there everyone that thought he was so

180
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,720
epic when he said that better not be

181
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,670
holding a [ __ ] iPhone that baseball

182
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,780
players hit a ball with wooden stick of

183
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,780
revenge white people

184
