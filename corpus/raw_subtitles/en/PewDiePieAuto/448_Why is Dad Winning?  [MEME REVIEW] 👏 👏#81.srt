much better it was such a dreary and

228
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,579
dark game and I don't even mind that but

229
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:32,070
it was just unnecessary

230
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:33,630
uh yes yes yes yes there's another meme

231
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,910

232
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,529
the le meme name a character that went

233
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,750
through more pain than her outweighed

234
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,140
any humans and I have no math on my

235
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,019
screen

236
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,220
correct and that's a fact name a

237
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,570
character that went through more pain

240
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,209
character that went through more pain

241
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,010
than her back when I was in high school

242
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,200
I wanted to approach this girl on a bus

243
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,000
on my way to school she was really hot

244
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,060
and I knew I'd regret it if I didn't

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,649
approach her there was one big problem

246
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,779
there was a middle-aged lady seated next

247
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:05,820
to her and I couldn't talk to this girl

248
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,860
without with the lady right next to her

249
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,200
I had to think of a quick way to get rid

250
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,870
of the lady and then woke up from my

251
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,060
seat slowly walked to the row they were

252
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,100
