466
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,440
the channel it's written by an old

467
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,520
samurai

468
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,160
how cool is that by the way uh

469
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,640
it's super interesting let's see if we

470
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,640
can show it

471
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,359
it's very short but i really recommend

472
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:21,599
it and there's strategy in it that

473
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:24,400
strategy of the samurai yeah musashi

474
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,400
can you guys see this

475
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,000
so i have the the ground book the water

476
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,000
book the fire book the win book

477
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,160
let's see if i remember son

478
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,599
oh yeah that was about school and stuff

479
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,599
like that i remember

480
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,839
let's do the fire book no

481
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,720
[ __ ] off i own the book

482
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,680
it is difficult to move strong things by

483
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,119
pushing directly

484
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,119
so you should injure the corners

485
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,920
you must study this yeah he always says

486
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,720
that here so you must research it deeply

487
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,000
he always that's it's so funny this

488
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,040
happens when you injure the corner of

489
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,359
his body

490
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,240
and this weakens him it is important to

491
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,810
know how to do this

492
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,200
so you must research it deeply

493
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:38,000
[Music]

494
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,760
some something something something

495
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,400
simultaneously with flourishing the long

496
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,240
sword

497
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,839
we shout during the fight to get into

498
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,240
rhythm research this

499
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:49,920
deeply you must understand this

500
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,599
what is meant by mingling it's a spirit

501
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,240
of advancing and becoming engaged with

502
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,480
the enemy

503
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,599
and not withdrawing even one step you

504
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,599
must understand this

505
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,400
it is necessary to consider how to renew

506
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:09,839
also applies in large-scale strategy

507
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:09,839
research this diligently

508
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,760
oh i gotta reread it so fun

509
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:24,480
anyway back to the game

510
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,359
if you've never read a book in a long

511
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,119
time and you're genuinely interested and

512
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,599
interested it's a really fun one to just

513
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,599
dive into

514
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,280
musashi's martial arts nitenichi

515
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,119
nitanichi

516
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,720
is still taught in dojo no way

517
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,280
how old is the book i should say in the

518
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,280
beginning right

519
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,200
in 1573.

520
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,359
no way that's oda

521
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,359
naga

522
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,960
it's just so cool to get these this is

523
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,960
why i love literature

524
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:19,839
no other medium can trans

525
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:19,839
transport you in time like them

526
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,440
the way of the sword is the moral

527
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,520
teaching of the samurai

528
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,520
fostered by the confucianist philosophy

529
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,880
we shape the tokugawa system

530
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,000
together with the native shinto religion

531
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,319
of japan

532
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,079
from the kamakura period the muromachi

533
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,880
period the wars

534
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,200
court of japan encouraged the austere

535
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,440
zen study among the samurai and zen went

536
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,280
hand in hand with the arts of war

537
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,960
in zen there are no elaboration it aims

538
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,040
directly at the true nature of things

539
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,319
there's no ceremonies no teaching the

540
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:00,079
prize of zen is essentially personal

541
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:02,960
makes sense are you guys bored

542
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,000
you don't think it's interesting should

543
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,000
we just read your book instead

544
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:15,839
i'm gonna

545
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
me

546
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,520

550
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,640
afterwards could be fun

551
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,280
i'm not walking the right way

552
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,280
i have not been studying diligently

553
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:42,079
i did not research it deeply

554
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:53,839
he's under the bridge it's a troll under

555
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:53,839

556
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,839
foreign

557
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:21,839

563
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,319
this is the way

564
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:11,400
[Music]

565
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,800
yeah i was thinking we could start with

566
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,319
a horror story

567
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,319
because that's simple and anyone could

568
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,880
get into it and then i would love to do

569
