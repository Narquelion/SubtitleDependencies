60
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,269

61
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,650
fanfiction writer at this point I mean

62
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:44,540
it worked for Fifty Shades of Grey

63
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,230
it's literally a Twilight fan fiction

64
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:51,170

00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,580
to make an apology videos at the last

108
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:46,469
year's thing so I'm just trying to be as

109
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,379
short and honest with this as possible

110
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:52,259
thank you for your honesty Shane Dawson

111
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,990
a guide to YouTube stars Shane Dawson's

112
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,930
viral apology about his tan this is why

113
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,189
I tell you guys if you need help writing

114
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,289
your apologies

115
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:04,560
just let your boy know cuz you might end

116
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:08,849
up like I mean this apology is 10 out of

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,710
10 I don't know the world so what

118
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:14,159
happened was basically Shane on a

119
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:16,650
podcast it said that he came on his cang

120
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:19,289
and he sounds pretty sincere when he

121
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,479
says it but I used to watch him Donathan

122
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:23,580
like way back in the day and I know he

123
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,529
had with like really edgy and strange

124
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,349
sense of humor it was always really

125
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:31,199
overly sexual and I always thought it as

126
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:33,330
a way of Shane dealing with his own

127
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,089
sexual frustrations he hadn't come out

128
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,069
as bisexual yet so in retrospect it

129
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:39,659
actually makes a lot of sense so while a

130
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,169
lot of people might be shocked by this

131
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:45,169
it's obviously just Shane making a joke

132
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,210
but the fact that it says it in such a

133
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,979
serious tone I also understand why some

134
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,589
people think it's real although it's

135
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,349
clearly not real okay but the most

136
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:57,839
important thing out of all this is of

137
00:05:55,349 --> 00:06:00,180
course yes that's right everybody the

138
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,930
memes I mean this just brings whole new

139
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,969
meaning to sad cat means I can't look at

140
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,330
them the same way I just know Shane did

141
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:12,960
something bad to that sorry cat why did

142
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,409
she go to you ah oh they're so sad and

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
cute

144
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:17,610
Shane hurt you didn't he just point out

145
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,839
the GP way to chain touch you the only

146
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,779
reason I'm bringing this up is to

147
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:25,379
deflect from this story that I brought

148
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,449
up on a podcast and I thought it was

149
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,840
hilarious like but apparently he was

150
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,190
more like shocked by it so the day at

151
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,630
like he went to tell everyone in school

152
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,450
that I didn't masturbate in my cat and

153
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,130
I'm like that's not what I did but then

154
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,169
I realized that first of all all right

155
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,030
let me just say guys in case you're

156
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,980

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,110

I didn't put my dick anywhere near my

161
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,060
cane I never done anything weird with

162
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,190

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,510
chucky cheese when they find out Shane

187
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,520
Dawson was effing his kin Chuckie Cheese

188
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:59,320
I bet they're the ones that discovered

189
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,510
this the Shane Dawson meme gets a

190
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,060
7-point gay cats by the way the cat is

191
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,710
Dave I feel bad like honestly a lot of

192
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,450
people are memeing this but a lot of

193
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,880
people are actually taking this very

194
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,160
seriously and are actually mad at Shane

195
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,350
Dawson and going after Shane Dawson and

196
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,210
attacking him just for this you know in

197
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,070
a way I can really relate to him because

198
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,229
you know he had an energy pass that

199
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,590
obviously follows him around and it's

200
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:27,440
not who who he is anymore so I can

201
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,510
relate and I feel bad so it'd be nice

202
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,029
and support chain everyone and also

203
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:35,270
Shane happy marriage that were you

204
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,919

205
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,020

exist they do in fact exist you know

208
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,100
when you watch something on

209
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,140
flicks and then the subtitles just shows

210
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,730
up being like noise in the background

211
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:55,250
like an audible sound or like music

212
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:59,960

on the toes here okay but let me just

233
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,530
ask one simple question what language do

234
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:55,250
deaf people thinking they never heard

235
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:59,920
language then how do they think a very

236

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:10,070
time it is but you don't understand sign

239
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:13,610
where's language and it's 8:54 so you

240
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:17,420
have to improvise that relatable moment

241
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:20,300
when it's 5:23 and you don't know the

242
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,080
time okay alright I'm sorry for being
