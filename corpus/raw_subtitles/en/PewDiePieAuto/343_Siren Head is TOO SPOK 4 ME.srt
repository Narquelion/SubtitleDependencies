100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,720
this reminds me of physics class when

101
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,760
you study why the ambulance sounds light

102
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,480
louder when it

103
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,280
travels towards you or the notes i mean

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,760
sounds higher

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,760
is how it is i forgot my physics class

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,840
yeah the wavelengths get stretched out

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360

108
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,239

original creator

it's four months ago jesus am i slow or

149
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,759
what i'm a 24 year old

150
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,520
soldier and after what happened to me i

151
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,639
had an uncontrollable fear of sirens

152
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,960
every saturday i feel like i

153
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,720
heard about this before every saturday

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,720
night at camp i can hear screams that

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,240
only i can hear i wake up my friends

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
sometimes just to see the reaction and

157
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,880
maybe

158
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,479
figure out a solution about it maybe

159
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,680
check it out or something but they never

160
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,280
heard a thing

161
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,360
every time i hear those screams they're

162
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,520
either a man or a woman

163
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,199
or a child scream but there's something

164
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,360
peculiar about them

165
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,120
it has this quite noticeable static

166
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,160
sound every time someone screams

167
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
or should i say whenever scream plays

168
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,000
it sounds like it's coming out of a

169
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,440
siren and it wakes me up every night

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,360
i learned to ignore it and i thought

171
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,280
it's probably just me imagining things

172
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,919
since i didn't like sirens that much as

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,199
a kid either too loud to be enjoyable it

174
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,120
wakes me up every night

175
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,479
and it sounds very realistic so i

176
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,400
thought i should ask the headmaster if

177
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,240
our sirens accidentally play those weird

178
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,840
sounds at night next morning i talked to

179
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,680
him about it and he said that it may

180
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,160
have been an error but even if it was

181
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,120
the signs were turned off at night only

182
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,120
the alarm ones

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,960
were on i tried to get him to look

184
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
deeper into this thing because i doubt

185
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,160
it was just an error and i was sure it

186
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,520
was coming from a siren

187
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,960
but he said he thinks i'm talking

188
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,800
nonsense and sent me to do some

189
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,639
exercises with the other soldiers

190
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,160
he might have been right i maybe was

191
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,520
just a bit paranoid this night the

192
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,520
sounds weren't that loud

193
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,039
it sounded as if it was playing from

194
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,639
somewhere inside the forest

195
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,639
i couldn't take it anymore i had to

196
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,199
check it out i grabbed a flashlight a

197
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
shotgun

198
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,400
and sneaked out a camp to go into the

199
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,160
forest and investigate

200
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,759
i know i may sound like a dumbass for

201
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
doing this like going out of

202
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
camp to check it out but those screams

203
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,840
were making my sanity fall apart

204
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,560
i kept walking and walking nothing was

205
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
found

206
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,720
but i could hear the sounds getting

207
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,360
louder i was sure i was approaching it

208
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,479
you're approaching me i ended up in a

209
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,639
straight dirt road

210
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,560
then i saw something it was too dark to

211
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,759
see but i could see something really

212
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,199
freaky in the dark

213
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,199
it was in the middle of the road so i

214
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,800
pointed my flashlight on it and there it

215
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,879
was a slim monster

216
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,479
that was about as tall as a tree having

217
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,720
long arms that could reach its toes and

218
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,520
for a head two sirens connected into a

219
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,360
tube

220
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,960
it looked very skinny as if it was only

221
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,919
bones but you could clearly see some

222
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,759
flesh on it

223
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,759
and it had metallic wires going through

224
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,800
its body i was terrified but without a

225
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,120
second thoughts

226
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,919
i immediately held my gun and shot it it

227
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
didn't die

228
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,360
but the bullet marks were clear and i

229
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,879
could see some blood running down but

230
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,039
instead of showing signs of pain

231
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,639
it started walking towards me without

232
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,400
any second thoughts i ran the opposite

233
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,160
direction from where i was facing

234
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
the siren mimicked my scream and played

235
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,879
it again oh that's so creepy

236
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,759
the static sounds always get me feeling

237
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,160
in my stomach

238
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
but from close up it was more terrifying

239
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,280
it then started to play

240
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,840
some other weird sounds coming from its

241
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,960
iron such as tornado warnings amber

242
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,959
alert announcement

243
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,640
and generally announced sir speaking

244
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,080
about scary things such as murders

245
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,479
criminal escapes and other messed up

246
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,399
stuff

247
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
i could run really fast but even though

248
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,000
it was walking it wasn't that far

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,159
away from me let's say i was far enough

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,480
for it to not catch me i grabbed my gun

251
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,640
again

252
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,480
stopped and shot a siren the sound it

253
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,080
was playing were glitched out i managed

254
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
to outrun it but it started approaching

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,560
me pretty quick

256
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,480
i was far enough but i could still see

257
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,560
in the dark i was running for about half

258
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,080
an hour felt more like an eternity

259
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
our distance didn't even change by a

260
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,880
centimeter it felt like i was running on

261
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,959
an infinite road

262
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,959
luckily i could see a car though someone

263
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,320
was there whoever it was i needed them

264
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,560
to get away from that thing

265
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,519
but to my disappointment it was long big

266
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,120
mistake stopping

267
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,800
the monster was now a bit closer and the

268
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,000
road got really bloody so it slowed me

269
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,160
down oh that's so creepy

270
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,600
i got out of the road and got inside the

271
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,760
forest it didn't come in

272
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,360
i could see it facing at me but it's not

273
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,279
moving i saw my camp

274
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,040
i was relieved but still scared to stop

275
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,360
and relax i asked the guards to let me

276
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,720
in

277
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,240
and since they knew me they obviously

278
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,760
opened the door they asked me what i was

279
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
doing outside this lane and how did i

280
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,600
get out

281
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,680
i apologized and asked them to keep it

282
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,279
secret but i later explained to them

283
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,959
what i saw and how i felt

284
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,399
they probably felt sorry for me and

285
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,480
thought that i was being paranoid

286
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,040
so they told me to get some rest i swore

287
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,720
to them i didn't lie for what i had seen

288
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,080
they still didn't believe me i shrugged

289
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,920
it up and went back to bed

290
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,519
that night i was so terrified it was the

291
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,839
most scary experience i ever had

292
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,600
around 5-6 a.m i woke up to sounds of

293
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,839
screams and subtle smell of smoke

294
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,959
i came outside to see what woke me up

295
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,040
everything was on fire

296
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,480
towers were torn apart and i could see

297
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,320
piles of dead bodies

298
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,680
the thing that caught my eyes though was

299
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
what i had seen some hours ago

300
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,240
that tall skinny siren head monster it

301
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
was responsible for everything

302
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,120
soldiers begged me to help them but i

303
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,560
could do nothing about it they were

304
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,240
literally torn in half

305
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,600
the monster saw me and reached out to

306
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,680
grab me it missed

307
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,120
the whole camp was on fire i even

308
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,440
wondered if i was in hell

309
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,320
i ran and i ran it chased me but never

310
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
stopped running

311
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,920
after running for so long i came to the

312
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,920
end of the cliff and now that there was

313
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,440
light i saw the monster more clearly

314
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,360
and now it was more terrifying than

315
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,680
before it stopped walking

316
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,040
i'd hear a crispy yet soothing voice

317
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,959
coming out of the siren

318
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,160
do you like heights mark how could this

319
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,000
monster know my name

320
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,680
this had to be a never-ending nightmare

321
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
but it was reality

322
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,519
come to me i begged the monster not to

323
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,320
kill me i cried and i asked it to leave

324
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,640
me alone

325
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,480
to my surprise it left not sure if it

326
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,760
regrets its decision or just wanted to

327
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,200
get revenge later

328
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,959
as i watched it turn around and

329
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
disappear into the woods

330
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,000
i felt relieved that i escaped out of

331
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,440
the situation

332
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,519
i went back to camp just to see all

333
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,440
those dead bodies and broken buildings

334
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,120
but i had to call someone or i wasn't

335
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,120
leaving this place i'm always carrying

336
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,600
my cell phone so i called 9-1-1 and told

337
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,600
them

338
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,800
to come to the camp address when they

339
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
arrived they told me to explain

340
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,360
everything

341
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,200
what happened and how i survived it i

342
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,800
described everything by detail

343
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,519
but they thought i was joking and told

344
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,680
me to act serious i told them i was

345
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,920
and they finally took it seriously sort

346
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,680
of they said they'd investigate this

347
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,839
i packed my stuff and they brought me

348
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,440
back to the city i went back home and

349
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,200
was happy to see my wife and kids

350
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
they were surprised i came so early i

351
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
was supposed to come five months later

352
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,079
i explained to my wife what had happened

353
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,680
and she just wouldn't believe me

354
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,120
she said i probably needed some rest and

355
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,160
got all this [ __ ] out of my crazy

356
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,160
imagination

357
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,480
all this makes me curious am i living in

358
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,519
a nightmare was i actually paranoid

359
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,040
whatever it was it's done for now

360
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,639
i pushed the curtains aside and opened

361
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,959
the window to get some fresh air

362
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,399
i looked outside it felt good to be home

363
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,560
but what i saw in the distance

364
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,720
made me feel shocked that monster was on

365
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,320
top of a building really far away

366
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,079
i tried to ignore it and went to get

367
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
some sleep i probably need to book a

368
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,800
therapy session

369
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,040
that was really creepy it's a cool

370
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,959
creepypasta gets you in the mood man

371
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,120
it seems like people are just jumping in

372
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,800
to become like the next slender

373
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,320
i mean at least slender had gameplay

374
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,000

siren head approves it was the same

436
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,040
thing with slender

437
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,480
the story about slenderman kept changing

438
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
you know people came up with different

439
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,160
ideas

440
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,480
he abducts kids or he does this or that

441
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,519
and it always changed like what does he

442
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,920
do what is he

443
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,800
it's all just based in people's mind i

444
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,800
think that's fun

445
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,880
how the internet does that hey we got

446
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,639
some siren head facts

447
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,040

448
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,920
oh god but why

449
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,199
fuse with dried skin it's a pretty cool

450
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,519
concept

451
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,199
surprisingly effective will remain

452
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,079
motionless while hunting that's so

453
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,880
creepy

454
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,000
seen in rural town areas and in heavily

455
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,839
