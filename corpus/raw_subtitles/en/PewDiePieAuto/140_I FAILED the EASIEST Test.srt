written

38
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,340
I assume this is plus coz double

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,040
negative but you don't write it like

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,890
that so it's already a it's up that's 6

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,369
is the answer 6 6 times 3 is 12 divided

42
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:05,550
with 2 is no sorries 18 divided by 2 is

43
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:12,150
a 18 9 9 plus 4 is 13 so it is 6 that

44
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:15,810
true no hangman oh wow I would even put
