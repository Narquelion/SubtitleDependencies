00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,630
so most people hear it around 1800 yeah

185
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,759
that makes sense

186
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,399
God Dan alright I'm always thought my

187
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,389
hearing was bad but I guess it's okay is

188
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,600
that what that means

189
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:56,680
alright typing I'm not really used to

190
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,230
this keyboard

191
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,029
Oh God once upon a time there was an old

192
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,060
mother pig who had three little pigs and

193
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,709
not enough to food to feed them so when

194
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:09,610
they were old enough okay here we go

195
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:13,389
Oh God ole mother pig who had three

196
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:18,610
little pigs and not enough food to feed

197
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:23,560
them so when they were old enough she

198
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:27,880
sent them out in to the world to seek

199
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:34,000
their fortunes the first little pig was

200
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:42,630
very lazy he didn't want to work at all

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,630
and he built his house ah oh ah no no

202
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,530
damn was that good almost 100 words per

203
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,530
minute

204
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,950
100 100 percent accuracy how is that

205
00:10:52,530 --> 00:11:01,230
good or bad I can't tell let's see oh

206
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:07,620
damn I came into this like a joke I'm so

207
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:09,930
good I feel pretty confident maybe I'm

208
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,790
not so dumb after all this has nothing

209
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:15,990
to do with intelligence but hey I'll

210
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:19,140
take it IQ tests next maybe oh god we

211
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:22,290
only have memory back left and I'm so

212
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:27,180
bad at memory okay mo what what happened

213
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:28,980
at 13 14 okay most people can do 9 all

214
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,650
right if I can be most people that's

215
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,920
really the goal here okay so remember

216
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:38,670
the the pattern yeah I remembered the

217
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:41,820
pattern alright easy so the average is 9

218
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:44,430
it's it's very easy in the beginning it

219
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:50,610
must be like a big learning curve after

220
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:55,100
9 see I'm already struggling okay come

221
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,100

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,210
I'm missing something

225
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:18,080
oh shoot ah I really only just looked at

226
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:19,410

same with numbers man same with numbers

255
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,779
this is just pain from now on what was

256
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:56,810
the number i legit was it a night I

257
00:13:50,779 --> 00:14:00,770
didn't look yeah god how do you guys

258
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,839
remember E this is really fun four four

259
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,940
five four okay yeah for my boy see I

260
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,580
really struggle the numbers like

261
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:11,240
whenever I have to remember passcodes

262
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:18,050
36.5 it's so tough 36 so five four six

263
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:20,870
three seventeen but I said it wrong in

264
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,150
my head that I got to do that again come

265
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,980
on I said it wrong in my head it doesn't

266
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,890
count if I say it wrong in my head I

267
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,680
can't really talk and and do this at the

268
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:33,589
same time these are really weird cuz I

269
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,540
really focus on one bit and I for some

270
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,670
reason if I focus on one the other one

271
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,209
we'll just stick like the last one I see

272
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,829
well there's be in my quicker memory see

273
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:45,290
I didn't even try to remember the last

274
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:45,920
numbers but they just stuck somehow it's

275
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,990
really weird

276
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,850
actually now I did the opposite that was

277
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,800
way easier I should memorize the last

278
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,529
part and then just look at one part and

279
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,020
type it in as fast as I can okay five

280
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:59,630
one three nine seven five one three nine

281
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,940
seven five one three nine seven five one

282
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:05,329
three nine seven five one three nine

283
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,850
seven five one three nine seven five one

284
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:11,180
three nine seven see that works that's

285
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,350
so cheating what is the average on this

286
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,540
oh god I'm

287
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:22,910
I shouldn't be bragging most people can

288
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:32,920
do this ok 9 4 6 4 6 1 9 4 6 4 6 1 9 4 6

289
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:32,920
4 6 1 9 4 6 4 6 1 9 4 6 4 6 1 9 4 6 4 6

290
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:40,580
I beat the average hey you ok so most

291
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,160
people really struggle around 10 and 11

292
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:49,280
let's see if this strategy works ok 40

293
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:55,940
41 40 40 1 3 6 9 40 40 1 3 6 9 40 40 1 3

294
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:57,530
6 9 40 40 1 3 6 9 40 40 I think I didn't

295
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,450
get it I didn't look at the first

296
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,280
numbers good enough yeah there you go

297
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,380
I'm not I'm not good at numbers clearly

298
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,710
my strategy didn't even even work all

299
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,750
right

300
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:11,060
