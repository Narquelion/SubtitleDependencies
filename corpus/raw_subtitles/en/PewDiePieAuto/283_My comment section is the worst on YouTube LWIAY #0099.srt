319
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:30,770
4,500,000 treats if it costs $1 to plant

320
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,740
one tree surely it's cheaper if we

321
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:35,720
manage to raise a lot of money right or

322
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,180
do they count that if they find 20

323
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,350
million trees it will cost $1 right do

324
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,990

just want to know how it works okay

327
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,320
or does it scale backwards where it's

328
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,240
more expensive I just want to know

329
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,830
because maybe technically we already

330
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,050
