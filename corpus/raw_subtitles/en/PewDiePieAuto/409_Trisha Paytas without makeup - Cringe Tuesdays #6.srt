week's tea comes from Trisha Paytas I'm

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,900
about five weeks late on this it was one

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,430
of those things where you see in your

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,840
peripheral you like I don't really care

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,670
about that but then the more you look

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,010

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,510

15
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,559
things

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,739
Teletubby is not one of them liar

17
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:04,280
manipulator playing victim aggressive

18
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:06,800

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,119

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,190

was the cameraman we send a deeper

28
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,979
Trisha has been wheezing her way in in

29
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,600
different ways where I hope that would

30
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:37,280
never see her again after that video

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,100
she's been part of the david dobrik

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:46,369
vlogs she's been doing her regulars feel

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:54,259

00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:56,810
my car there recently she got there in a

35
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:58,430
bit the drama with Nick although I would

36
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,220

37
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,610
brain cells great keep watching you see

38
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,590

who would make a cover of her song and

40
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,619
Nicole called me the beautiful song

41
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,519

42
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,430

43
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:35,970

46
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,610

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,349
like I have loved you for so long as a

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,070
opposed to be cringe we're getting into

89
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,440
the cringe the cringe is bad area if it

90
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,299
has meaning behind it

91
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,370
okay but the best part about this is

92
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,650
that even though Trisha clearly publicly

93
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,660
said that she subscribed to him watch

94
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:30,730
his videos and wanted to collab with him

95
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,730

subscribed in the comments of that video

108
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,180
the only thing I heard of him was what

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,130
he did my warrior brah well I thank you

110
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,740

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,620
fans want to hear an apology I'm not

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,730
sorry I feel like you don't know anyway

113
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,730
anything you really know can you

114
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:23,720
acknowledge that ghosting him was rude I

115
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:25,669
don't I don't think it's not really you

116
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,740
know you're messed up big time if Paris

117
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:28,790
Hilton is the voice of reason I don't

118
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,120
know what you want me to say like I'm

119
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,290
not gonna pawn as this person is like

120
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,720
like you know what I mean like there's

121
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,160
something like a little off here asked

122
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,960
he lied I didn't

123
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,760
I felt harassed by him that was it was

124
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,720
still insane it was so insane it's so

125
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,220
scary to me so then she just completely

126
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,080
changed the story because you know

127
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,640
Trisha can't be the bad person the

128
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,860
reason why she goes to him was she was

129
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,410
scared of him that's right because

130
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,680
Naqada avocado had a thumbnail where he

131
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,570
had a knife and said I had enough and

132
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,550
she's just scared of him so now that we

133
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,910
know that she's not a good person it's

134
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,740
okay to make fun of her yeah the next

135
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,900
stop came from H Street Street where I

136
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,419
followed this it was really funny

137
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,430
basically Ethan did a video calling out

138
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,080
the Instagram versus reality subreddit

139
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,180
where you have pictures like this I

140
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,650
actually wanted to make a video in this

141
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,090
my my eye that's too high I'm not

142
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,630
touching that someone's gonna lash out

143
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,250
lo and behold Trisha Paytas saw that

144
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,289
video cuz she was in it I can't even

145
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,320
tell him is any of these Trisha Peters

146
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:33,000
like honestly cannot help there

147
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,620
why do you why are you even a model if

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,229
you're gonna modify your looks that much

149
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,820
it's like from beauty queen to WWF

150
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,300
wrestler in two seconds

151
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,650
you cannot Foix up your heart and soul

152
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,449
remember that this girl tried to use a

153
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:51,060
face filter on Instagram and her phone

154
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:53,280
blew up she is the best isn't she not

155
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,930
the best would people even recognize her

156
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,699
if they saw her on the street I mean I

157
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,320
mean to be afraid you probably do this

158
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,330
with almost anyone probably not to the

159
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,370
same extreme but you can take a photo

160
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,780
there's no ugly photos of me however but

161
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,910
over someone else you could take an ugly

162
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,830
photo and then like a BAM photo and be

163
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,389
like yeah this is Coachella verse

164
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,440
throwing down in the McDonald's parking

165
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:15,720
lot at 3 a.m.

166
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:19,380
Chella vs. WorldStarHipHop oh that

167
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,680
cannot be the same person to Coachella

168
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,660
versus open-casket funeral so how did

169
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,400
Trish I responded to this video of

170
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,800
course she had the most eloquent

171
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,979
thought-out response that really put

172
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,470
Ethan to place please Allah Cline h3 do

173
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:38,419
not raise your child to be as ignorant

174
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:42,150
as your husband I would divorce him ASAP

175
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,750
as he is causing so much damage to young

176
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,330
women

177
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,460
it's basically second act I never been

178
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,830
more disgusted I think that's pretty

179
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:52,050
fair just tweeting someone's pregnant

180
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,419
wife how to race their child and to

181
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,340
leave their husband Jesus Christ could

182
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,780
you have been any more gross about it I

183
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,940
wasn't gonna say anything but obviously

184
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,610
when people attack ela it's mask off and

185
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,320
I saw her profile pic and I go who was

186
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,210
this rude person I don't recognize her

187
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,000
from her profile picture does anyone

188
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,470
know her she then made a video at 6:00

189
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,500
in the morning sitting on the kitchen

190
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,360
floor hey guys what is up is and then

191
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,580
she even admits to not even having to

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,510
watch his video big platform and like

193
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,860
shaving these women like I did

194
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,360
fast-forward to my part I don't really

195
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,099
watch the other people he talked about

196
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,880
Chloe and then right after me Jesus

197
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,460
Christ

198
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,710
I felt like Ethan's video yeah it was

199
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,839
making fun of people obviously that's a

200
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,520
sensitive topic I get it but I think

201
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,860
it's worth criticizing these things

202
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,390
where Instagram has just become this

203
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,419
staple of how people compare themselves

204
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,240
to

205
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,950
look on these insanely retouched photos

206
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,320
or edited photos me like okay why don't

207
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,120
why not look like that when the reality

208
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,279
is actually quite different and I think

209
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,470
that's a lot more damaging than making

210
00:08:51,279 --> 00:09:02,860
fun of it don't need a beep beep like

211
00:08:53,470 --> 00:09:05,410
that Dowell like the reason I post those

212
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,510
ugly photos next to eight pretty photos

213
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:11,440
wait so she's the one that posed these

214
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:13,870
photos she's the one that she's the

215
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,850
source other people can't laugh at it

216
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,510
though cuz I do I always want girls to

217
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,199
know that like it's okay to like be like

218
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,050
this

219
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:24,279
this was Ethan's message as well that's

220
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,720
literally what he said if you had

221
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,240
watched the damn video instead of

222
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,810
lashing out on his wife Jesus Christ

223
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,089
dude

224
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,220
now Trisha Paytas has done some pretty

225
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:35,350
funny things she said some pretty great

226
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,110
stuff I feel like she does play into the

227
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:41,130
dumb blonde role like she purposely try

228
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:44,500
and make her stupid dogs are and are

229
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,570
mammals right yeah dogs are mammals

230
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,760
they're humans or no they're not human

231
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:51,370

God created I love you do this that is

233
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:57,910
an amazing sense yeah dogs are mammals

234
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,620
they're humans dogs are human no they're

235
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,320
not human they're part of the animal

236
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,820
kingdom that God created I love you

237
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,070

238
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,380

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:15,240

284

stomach for cringe Tuesday's that's

00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,410
stricture paid us everyone I'm sorry for

286
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,880
bringing this to light

287
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,890
I feel like Trisha belongs in this

288
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,800
category of youtubers I just have no

289
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,780
shame it's like the mukbang videos no

290
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,640
one wants to watch those videos you

291
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,280
might say oh well some people like them

292
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,990
sure like what 2% of people that's not

293
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,940
the reason they exist there they're

294
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,680
flashy thumbnail and people are grossed

295
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,450
out by them people don't want to see

296
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,070
that people are outraged about them this

297
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,630
kind of content that no one wants to see

298
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,880
it's kind of content where you're crying

299
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,190
on camera deliberately which I would

300
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,690
never go just whatever it takes to get

301
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,780
views on YouTube there's no shame

302
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,590
whatsoever but Trisha is the exception

303
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,270
of at the same time just being insanely

304
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,980
insecure which is not a good combination

305
00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:00,580
she does have some likeable qualities

306
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,580
though like she's

307
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:15,860
what you never played super simulator

308
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:19,250
you know it's fun right I'm not supposed

309
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,529
to give my opinion but give it a try and

310
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:25,130
then you can tell me if it's good or not

311
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,459
not convinced yet okay I'll cut you a

312
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,490
deal

313
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:30,370
the game is available for free and

314
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,440
that's a great price
