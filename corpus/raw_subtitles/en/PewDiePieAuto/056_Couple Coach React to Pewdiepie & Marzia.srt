because i was going to norway

192
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,800

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,400
his subscribers before he met marzia was

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
this a first-time thing for him was this

209
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,440
new to him

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,560
all i know is the conversation between

211
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,199
them was so

212
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,120
adorable and it was romantic from the

213
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,199
get-go i thought maybe they were like

214
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
chatting about video games as friends

215
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,720
for a while and then somebody talked

216
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,720
about visiting each other

217
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,479
and it was kind of cute and innocent but

218
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
no they got right to the point pretty

219
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,399

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,880
dating coach think about

224
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,560

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,320
someone

229
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,600
you you should not acknowledge it at

230
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
least somehow

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,680

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,120
as much as a year

244
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,560
usually when someone recognizes me or us

245
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,040
they'll come to me first and then

246
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,519

incredibly well and i just want to head

272

this home

273
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,399
one last time and i don't want you to

274
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,959
get involved but this is so important to

275
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,399
me because

276
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,000
like i said this has changed so many

277
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,519
people's lives lana rhodes

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,880
would never want to go for pewdiepie

279
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,880
who lana rhodes

280
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:52,959
is that what some e girl

281
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,120
i would probably not be found attractive

282
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,560
in a lot of circles i mean like let's

283
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,600
let's put aside the fact

284
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,880
he's incredibly famous put him with 500

285
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,680
000 subscribers you know

286
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,160
not really well known and he goes into

287
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,800
some

288
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,800
random sports bar in new jersey put him

289
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,800
in like a business networking event

290
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,120
somewhere in idaho i don't know

291
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,399
his personality may just seem too weird

292
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,959
for those people too

293
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,480
out there uh interested in video games

294
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,800
and pokemon and like

295
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,800
isn't that for kids or something a lot

296
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
of people could see him that way and say

297
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,279
hey

298
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,640
i mean you're kind of you're not like

299
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,920
ugly but like

300
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,720
that cool man a lot of

301
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,640
women a lot of people could see him like

302
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,480
that

303
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,079
pewdiepie doesn't go in those worlds

304
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,399
pewdiepie doesn't value

305
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,240
those worlds felix goes to places and he

306
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,279
hangs with the people

307
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,279
that he values i feel like i just

308
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,920
listened to the most elaborate way

309
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,880
of someone telling me i'm a loser virgin

310
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,520
but uh i'm

311
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,279
uh yeah

312
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,880
[Laughter]

313
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,800
he was literally selling hot dogs for

314
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,680
labor when she messaged him oh that's

315
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,519
right

316
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,880
i was oh man who's this felix guy

317
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,279
messaging martial we need to tell pierce

318
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,079
no you could say yeah he had millions of

319
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,240
subscribers

320
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,399
he was really big and that's why marzah

321
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,519
was initially attracted to him

322
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,480
and i would say no what i would really

323
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,519
say is

324
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,079
felix made videos that he was interested

325
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,480
in

326
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,399
and he attracted people that were

327
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,440
interested in similar things

328
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,320
that also god he spent so much time on a

329
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,480
point that is just

330
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,519
completely wrong you don't have to start

331
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,160
a youtube channel

332
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,600
there's so many other avenues to give

333
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,839
value to the world and

334
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,800
find people that connect with you in

335
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,839
similar

336
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,320
ways i mean it does make a good point

337
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,240
yeah it's easier to find someone uh if

338
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,040
you enter the circles of the kind of

339
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,720
people

340
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,040
that you are comfortable with it's much

341
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
easier to find someone that you like and

342
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,360
you don't have to pretend to be someone

343
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,920
else

344
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,079
to sort of get uh girls if that's the

345
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
goal or guys or whatever you know i'm

346
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,200
saying

347
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,959
you like the peepee of the poopy i ain't

348
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,320
judging you

349
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,320
bro bro bro b

350
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,079
i he's actually has a good point i

351
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,399
remember that especially when i was um

352
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,160
younger it's like i was never really a

353
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,560
party guy but i kind of felt like i had

354
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,440
to be

355
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,519
to get girls let's get rips that's where

356
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,200
you meet them so it's like oh i love the

357
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,320
party yeah

358
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,360
i love to do all this [ __ ] you pretend

359
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
you're someone else

360
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,519
um but it's not going to be a long

361
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,079
long-lasting relationship doing that

362
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,760
youtube is just one avenue for doing so

363
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,639
and that's the way that felix did and

364
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,160
that's the way that

365
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,199
marzia met felix that's about it for

366
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,160
today guys

367
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,600
oh my god he made such a long point that

368
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,600
is so wrong

369
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,639
you share those interests with those

370
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,320
people you are

371
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,160
naturally going to fall into

372
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,360
relationships with people that you're

373
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,959
attracted to

374
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,880
i don't think me and martin necessarily

375
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,000
shared that many interests when we met

376
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,079
we both love japan

377
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,199

introduced to me

382
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,959
we've been watching a lot of dating

383
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,639
shows lately and i keep thinking how

384
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,800
stupid it is for people to have these

385
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,320
criterias of who they want to meet

386
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,760
because it's like if you really like

387
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
someone you're not going to give a [ __ ]

388
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,880
about

389
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,920
these criterias and it doesn't work the

390
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,240
other way around

391
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,000
he has to be taller than me he has to

392
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,160
have a bigger nipples than me

393
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,760
he has to like if you really like

394
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,199
someone it doesn't matter

395
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,199
