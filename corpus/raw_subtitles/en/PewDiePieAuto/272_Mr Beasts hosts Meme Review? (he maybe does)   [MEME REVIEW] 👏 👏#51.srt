00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,440
don't know we've never gotten this far

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,010
how do you follow up an episode like

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,949

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:27,869

10
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,559
freakin do this - like a pure excited

11
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,680
when it's Steve Urban's birthday and

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,550
nobody seems to be celebrating this is

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,309
very sad but but the pipette out out of

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,850
nowhere comes Google and Google knows

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,340
we can't just let things be positive we

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,010
can't just have nice things

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,140
Pizza that's right Pizza everyone

21
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,590
decided to take the moral high ground

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,590
and as a response to this Google header

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,200
PETA posted this Steve Urban was killed

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,080
while harassing array the mental

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,909
gymnastics of this organization he

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,580
dangled his baby while feeding a

27
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,040
crocodile and wrestled wild animals who

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,240
were minding their own business you know

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,560
who should be minding your own business

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,290
PETA I you you shut up today's Google

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,290

33
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,150

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,750
everyone dislike that no one likes you

35
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,549
PETA

36
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,220

37
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,049
anything you say someone replied Steve

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,290

39
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,409

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,860

week's meme review we have a meme that's

151
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,150
been sitting lurking in the background

152
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:36,490
for quite a while and it's kind of

153
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,380
taking on many different shapes and

154
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,960
forms and I don't really know how to

155
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,040
summarize it but I'll try my best to

156
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,980
explain this god-awful atro shitty name

157
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,890
Ricardo Ricardo started off with tick

158
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:54,130
tock trolls okay here I am basically

159
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:57,040
trying to watch some some tick tock

160
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,440
videos and then out of nowhere this

161
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,640
fricking guy comes in and I'm like I'm

162
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,640
not gay I don't like this

163
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,590
it's basically the skedaddle skadoodle

164
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,440
your dick is not one it's basically that

165
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,680
level of tear okay first you get annoyed

166
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,300
but then it happens again and and you

167
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,140
just look at him and you're like oh god

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:29,070

you know I'm not gay but if I had to

171
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,180
pick between the tic-tock girl or

172
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,820
Ricardo I'm gonna have to think really

173
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,220
hard about it at least the eternal

174
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,100
struggle between good and evil

175
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,740
tick tock girl versus Ricardo well

176
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,290
Ricardo is stronger I have to say that

177
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,900
he has more muscles so I think he's got

178
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,760
the win on me

179
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,980

to look like the leech like that's why I

237
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:09,529
only did all this but I get barrage by

238
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:11,959
tweets every day so uh why are ya one

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:18,049

both weeks should get a diaper seems

241
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:20,869
like the simple fix

242
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,819

and so you just tell my god I gotta help

245
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:28,850
hold it in and you just blew up that's

246
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:32,929
funny cuz that's like an eight or nine

247
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:36,740
for me we got it next mr. B's PewDiePie

248
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:38,240
putting in know everything it's pretty

249
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,949
accurate up until he started

250
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,269
live-streaming it literally it's

251
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:43,490
something that's like hey do be like

252
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,799
that but seriously it does kind of hurt

253
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,600
when you put a lot of effort into the

254
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,100
board campaign a few pies the next day

255
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,449
or whatever just like I don't care if I

256
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,970
get past I don't really care about being

257
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:57,470
number one and they just like ah but we

258
00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:00,410
do we care game review I am NOT a racist

259
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:03,110
but that's how every racist person

260
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,799
starts up everything they say I'm not a

261
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,129
racist

262
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:10,040
but there's so many things I want to say

263
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:10,579
I just can't I'm not as savage as

264
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,379
PewDiePie

265
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:15,259
you know like he would probably say

266
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:18,139
something slightly racist here t-series

267
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:20,660

270
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:28,110
attractive men yeah I

271
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,490
that was a long time ago active woman I

272
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,240

it up the good part that's how many yeah

278
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:46,260
this the meme should just VIN this it is

279
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,140
boom problem solved okay all right I

280
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,360
think we have Tula Super Bowl ad TV but

281
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,400
no key mysteries supported the most by

282
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,690
spending a lot of money for PT pad same

283
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,070
QT five hundred thousand times that

284
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,839
helped me indeed if I receive eight

285
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,600
hundred thousand plus subscribers first

286
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,000
off I don't think I ever tweeted that I

287
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,920
think he did no I never tweeted that

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,970
that is a fake tree but anyways let me

289
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,770
clear it up a little bit

290
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,600
basically when I said PewDiePie hundred

291
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,339
thousand times I said I was going to try

292
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,290
to buy PewDiePie yet the game plan was

293
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,120
to sell stuff to PewDiePie shirts and

294
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,010
hoodies like this make a few million

295
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,630
dollars off of it and put that towards

296
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,210
the end that is what I planned on doing

297
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,589
and that is why I said that but after I

298
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,630
uploaded that video we ran into some

299
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,640
complications I learned that there's a

300
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,020
really good chance of Superbowl probably

301
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,700
wouldn't approve the yet like there's

302
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,320
some marijuana company that didn't get

303
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,700
approved even though they offered like

304
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,860
ridiculous amounts of money for the

305
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,959
Superbowl and so then I had a dilemma do

306
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,950
I sell stuff to peopIe shirts telling

307
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,480
everyone I'm gonna take all the money

308
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,580
and put it towards a Superbowl ad and

309
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,290
then you know make a few million dollars

310
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,580
but then the ad gets declined so then

311
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,440
I'm stuck with a few million dollars and

312
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,490
then yeah obviously I give it to charity

313
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,140
but then people would be even more

314
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,400
disappointed I didn't know I just I

315
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,110
didn't know if they would reject or

316
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,570
approve yet so I never went through with

317
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,520
the idea of selling this like really

318
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,860
hard with the promise of buying a Super

319
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,540
Bowl ad so after that we decided to make

320
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,800
these shirts and the blankets and get a

321
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,360
you know seats right behind the

322
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,470
goalposts to promote them because they

323
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,880
said we're gonna do something at the

324
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,440
Superbowl and we didn't want to not

325
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,800
deliver anything just what we written

326
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,470
that yeah so this meme doesn't have

327
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,190
accurate information so it's labeled

328
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,860
inaccurate

329
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,500
does not get it ready next during like

330
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,630
Oh God oh man the pain is so great that

331
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,250
a woman can almost imagine what a man

332
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,270
feels like when he accidentally kills

333
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,580
the dog in Minecraft

334
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,560
Hertz with your minecraft dog falls in

335
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,450
lava I may not be able to relate to a

336
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,310
