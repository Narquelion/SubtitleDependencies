1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,269
everyone did an oopsie

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:13,300
[Music]

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:27,989
my name is glue

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:27,989
[Music]

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,320
area border and you're watching the most

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,449
respectable news site outlet of all time

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,480
that is not our personal bias that is

8
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:45,449
just straight-up facts now some news for

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:48,010
a lesser media outlet bus feed everyone

10
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:51,610
pathetic BuzzFeed prints a one-off

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,760
magazine wow that's incredible

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,820
wow how innovative going back to print

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,760
what a great idea and put Momo on the

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,860
cover this is phenomenal work by speed

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,659
good job by speed you really did you're

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,400
really outdone yourself this time by

17
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:08,650
speed can I sound a little bit more

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,140
condescending so this was on my Twitter

19
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,700
newsfeed for some reason Twitter decided

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,850
hey you want to know about this

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,430
BuzzFeed everyone it's a and I loved all

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,100
the responses to this basically no one

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,170
cares

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,810
good call moving to brain booming

25
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,090
industry so you're telling me the

26
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,579
creative director said when history

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,450
looks back at bus feeds number one issue

28
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:36,549
we want the iconic mama to be undercover

29
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,979
well well well too bad there won't be

30
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:41,289
any history for BuzzFeed I know this is

31
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:44,950
so sad last month it was reported that

32
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:46,840
as many as 2,100 people have lost their

33
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,990
media jobs in the past two weeks

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,499
BuzzFeed having a cut of 15% of its

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,780
staff this is so sad okay I'm not giving

36
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:57,009
my opinion but I'm literally shaking and

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,200
crying right now

38
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:05,979
BuzzFeed who hire such amazing people

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:09,550
like Joe Bernstein oh god no no I lied

40
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:12,040
not Vice to Vice laying off ten

41
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,470
percenter they were of course vice at

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,230
are such incredible journalism I mean

43
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,450
this is a huge blow for journalism how

44
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,910
are we possibly going to survive now

45
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:26,920
obviously people losing their job is not

46
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:29,620
to be celebrated but but kind of hard to

47
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,900
feel bad for companies that have run

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,660
these smear campaigns and not just

49
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,069
against me but other people as well are

50
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,049
you supported a keep thinking they can

51
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,640
do this kind of stuff without getting

52
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:42,709
away with it obviously there are many

53
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,650
factors involved but I find it ironic

54
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,799
and funny how a BuzzFeed two years ago

55
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,620
after the Wall Street Journal scandal

56
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:53,750
posted about my downfall writing his

57
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,269
downfall fields and the capitalist it

58
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,459
feels non conformist it makes us feel

59
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,230
all the things we love to feel when

60
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:03,379
trying to prove we're better than that

61
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,510
well well well what a downfall indeed

62
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,019
have fun BuzzFeed I'll be laughing all

63
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,220
the way

64
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:12,200
next news next news comes from Captain

65
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,879
Marvel that's right y'all know I would

66
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,049
talk about this the reason why I haven't

67
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,459
done a few news in a while this I

68
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,739
haven't been too invested in what's

69
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,720
happening and it's been kind of nice to

70
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,389
be honest but this is one of those news

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,680
that you just can't you can't escape

72
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:26,900
it's been literally everywhere

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,150
recommended in all the feeds Rotten

74
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,430
Tomatoes explains why it removed

75
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,919
thousands of audience reviews on Captain

76
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,549
Marvel's opening day well I don't even

77
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:39,590
have to research this Disney paid that

78
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:43,400
that is not facts that is just pure

79
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:46,400
speculation but it also most importantly

80
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,989
is my opinion basically if you don't

81
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,540
know what happened here the Captain

82
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:53,239
Marvel audience score review on Ron

83
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,190
tomatoes was at 33% and then a lot of

84
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,650
review stirs disappeared and got deleted

85
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,859
some people were estimating over 50,000

86
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,260
and now it's sitting at 55% like ratio

87
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:05,599
now whoever still enjoys Marvel films

88
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,299
you know that's that's up to you but a

89
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,609
lot of people define this as trolls you

90
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:12,349
know this is trolls and therefore we

91
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:14,269
have every right to remove their review

92
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,329
you're a troll then your opinion doesn't

93
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:19,340
count basically is trolls that's a good

94
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,560
excuse to remove freedom of speech if

95
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,010
you're a troll then you're not allowed

96
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,090
to voice your opinion this annoys me so

97
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,830
much because it reminds me of the

98
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,479
goddamn Amy Schumer thing I don't know

99
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,550
if you remember her Netflix special

100
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,860
which was one of the worst thing I've

101
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,780
ever watched and Ikey I watch that with

102
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,810
an open mind five percent liked this

103
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,030
film according to Google users after the

104
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,310
bad reviews came out on Netflix from

105
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,770
name is Schumer special they removed the

106
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,719
five star rating system which now makes

107
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,740
it impossible to find something that you

108
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:51,960
actually like on Nathalie

109
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,720
I've just given up trying to find stuff

110
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,720
from their run to Maine said that it was

111
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,820
a bug a bug that removed ten thousands

112
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,490
of audience review okay Ron tomatoes

113
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,820
sure sure are we expected to believe

114
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,200
this now you might ask yourself why why

115
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,210
was it getting bad reviews at the

116
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,430
beginning well some people obviously

117
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,500
liked the film some people described it

118
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,450
as bland and not that interesting and I

119
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,370
mean considering how many Marvel films

120
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,860
they've done at this point it's probably

121
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,200
kind of hard to innovate personally I

122
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,690
think a lot of people dislike this film

123
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,120
because of the main Cara main actress

124
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,160
brie Larson who is probably one of the

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,830
most unlikable lead female characters

126
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,380
I've seen in a long time I mean just and

127
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,890
one more question um what does it mean

128
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:41,040
to be a woman in film it means it's

129
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:43,860
really hard and if you're a woman of

130
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,420
color then it's really really hard god

131
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,250
everyone just wants to be a victim don't

132
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:52,200
think imagine being the lead lead of a

133
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,850
multimillion what is it like 500 million

134
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,690
was the pledge for this baby doesn't

135
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,330
matter and then say it's really hard to

136
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,220
imagine being attractive being paid

137
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,280
millions and then going it's so hard

138
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,700
like Jesus Christ imagine being the

139
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,640
figure of a female strong character and

140
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,290
going it's really hard Jesus Christ

141
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,420
now what's ironic about this whole

142
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,090
situation but review skins removed is

143
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:21,240
that Libra and Larson hundra herself in

144
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,310
the past expressed that she doesn't like

145
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,670
the way the system of reviews is done

146
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,980
because a movie that she liked what was

147
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:32,250
it a tangle in time or something was

148
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,260
called a wrinkle in time got bad reviews

149
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,490
her response to that was basically well

150
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:41,460
it wasn't made for you 67% of white men

151
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,350
are making these reviews that's why it

152
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,580
got bad reviews because it wasn't made

153
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:51,300
for white man okay released findings

154
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:55,290
that 67% of the top critics reviewing

155
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,620
the 100 highest-grossing movies in 2017

156
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:01,080
were white males less than a quarter

157
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,849
were white women and less than 10% were

158
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,029
unrepresented men

159
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:10,119
only 2.5 percent of those top critics or

160
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:12,009
women of color it's important to note

161
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:13,809
the fact here that brie Larson doesn't

162
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:15,789
hate white man and I'm also saying I

163
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:18,069
don't hate white dudes I'm just saying

164
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:21,069
I'm not supposed to give my opinion but

165
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:23,889
I'm just saying am I saying that I hate

166
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:28,179
white dudes no I'm not let me try and

167
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:32,859
unwrinkled this she hates white students

168
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:34,419
or I and for the third time I don't hate

169
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:35,049
white dudes now whether you agree with

170
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,739
her or not

171
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:40,779
I think her politics is what muddled

172
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:42,129
people's opinion about her at least and

173
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:43,449
I think that's fair you know not

174
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,789
everyone wants to politics and

175
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,709
everything and I see it is getting kind

176
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,569
of knowing at this point I think what

177
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:52,839
annoys me the most out of all this is

178
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:54,939
it's the straw Manning of if you didn't

179
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,279
like this film then that means you're a

180
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:59,289
troll or that you don't like seeing

181
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,319
strong female characters or yada yada

182
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:04,299
yada it's the same thing every time I

183
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,039
stumbled upon this footage for example

184
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:07,569
there are people who get very bent out

185
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,939
of shape about the fact that she's a

186
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,459
woman and that buries a woman and wants

187
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:15,909
to see women moving into an equal place

188
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:17,860
inhumanity to men sad it must be sad to

189
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:21,279
me that kind of dinosaur wandering

190
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,499
toward the Tar Pits ah yes

191
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,089
that's why Aleta battling Joe was

192
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:26,979
getting so much hate as well that's what

193
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:29,259
people are been out of shape over that

194
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:32,289
movie getting released or Wonder Woman

195
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:34,930
or literally hundreds of female main

196
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,539
character films no one cares no one is

197
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,490
making this argument that people don't

198
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,029
want equality or seeing strong female

199
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,099
character

200
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,529
whatever it was he said and wants to see

201
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,600
women moving into an equal place in

202
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:49,000
humanity to men or that women can move

203
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,269
in tune equal plays out a man no one is

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,370
saying that no one maybe like a very

205
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:57,069
small percentage but of course anyone

206
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,120
that dislike this film you don't want to

207
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,740
see wither then you just don't want to

208
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,139
see women moving in to the same place

209
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,520
you know what people don't realize how

210
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:06,470
hard it is being a female news anchor

211
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,950
but you don't see me complaining about

212
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,620
it now 400 times more important news dog

213
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,870
showed up for story time at library but

214
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,870
nobody came to read to him no

215
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,940
unfortunately nobody signed up to read

216
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:26,750
to sting at the White Bear Lake library

217
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,910
I'm shaking and crying what Felix this

218
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,680
news was posted a year ago why are you

219
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,640
talking about this now it is still

220
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,030
relevant

221
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,280
goddamnit Forbes attacks PD PI that's

222
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,440
right they wrote this article saying

223
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,650
it's time to unsubscribe from PD P

224
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,690
versus T series okay alright they're

225
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,330
basically saying both channels have been

226
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,280
irresponsible prioritizing the attention

227
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,740
growth of their channels instead of

228
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,320
helping to create a wholesome YouTube

229
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,540
community Oh Forbes just care about

230
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,660
creating a wholesome YouTube community

231
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,460
support the creator's the community is

232
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,760
what God involved with this I didn't

233
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,770
even start this whole thing it's the

234
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,450
community that keeps it alive and

235
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,700
they've done so many incredible things

236
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,680
that I'm so proud of and the reason why

237
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,290
they're bringing this up is because a

238
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,680
few days ago it came up that someone

239
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,690
defaced a world war 2 memorial by AB

240
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,250
writing subscribe to PewDiePie this has

241
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,950
been covered in so many different places

242
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,450
and obviously it is desire it's

243
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,910
disgusting you know I don't think I've

244
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:33,440
done anything to condone this sort of

245
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:36,530
behavior but of course a Forbes right

246
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,730
right after that I've said a good meme

247
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,640
for a good cause

248
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,560
and I sort of implying that they even

249
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,350
wrote it straight out the Creator hasn't

250
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,700
made any effort to temper the extremes

251
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:51,830
of his fanbase what am I gonna do like

252
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,430
first of all that's just not true I

253
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:57,050
already said in many times that don't do

254
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,900
anything legal because I would obviously

255
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,770
look bad on me but doing this sort of

256
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:05,050
hack print acts

257
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,030
people doing protests people being

258
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,560
holding up signs all these things are

259
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,140
just amazing and really fun to follow

260
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,720
and I think it's really cool no I don't

261
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,130
think I've done anything to to condone

262
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,350
this sort of behavior

263
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,180
obviously it's disgusting obviously I

264
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,920
don't condone it whatsoever

265
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,130
I don't know why anyone got in their

266
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,680
mind to do this it's just stupid most

267
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,690
likely it's just a kid it looks like

268
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,910
they just grabbed a stone to scribe it

269
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:34,840
in and the mix of large and small

270
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,820
letters kind of signifies it as well it

271
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,380
looks like it's many different kids it

272
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,060
looks like you could probably remove

273
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,750
that pretty easily at least which I'm

274
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,180
really glad because I would hate for

275
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,740
that to to be there if anyone knows if

276
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,180
it has been removed please let me know

277
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,900
because it's just terrible

278
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,940
honestly don't do this I don't know it's

279
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,360
like I'm expected to say don't do this

280
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,530
obviously don't do this do I shouldn't

281
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,660
have to say it even

282
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,550
but of course Forbes has to go out of

283
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,710
