stigma to freak the Boston dynamic robot

think getting shot in the knees and Plus

160
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,370
that would make digging the grave a lot

161
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:15,180
harder if you're laying on the ground

madland until 1979 Sweden classified

283
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:43,639
homosexuality as a mental illness that

284
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:45,499
year activists took the classification

285
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:50,149
as an illness to its logical extent

286
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:51,980
