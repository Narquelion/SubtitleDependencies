thank you

62
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:55,569
next dose so basically the way I find

63
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,040
out about all this was that I was

64
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:59,260
literally googling myself

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,669
I don't normally google myself okay

66
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,230
because I would needed a picture of

67
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:03,970
myself for thumbnail I don't I'm not

68
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,370
dilute sir I swear I don't think I would

69
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,409
go myself what is this now media portray

70
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,680
pewdiepie is a loser to sell his success

71
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:13,780
story says huge damage it never ends

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,370
there's so many articles coming out

73
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,519
lately I'm just like I can't keep up

74
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,620
with this I mean that goes for anyone I

75
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,510
thought it was so obvious when I said

76
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,400
that it's like when you sorry this is a

77
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,139
complete sidetrack by the way just

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,030
happen to see this it's cuz I did the

79
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,040
Q&A video and a lot of people had a lot

80
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,290
of responses to that or just echoing

81
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,970
what I said he said this in short

82
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,319
pewdiepie things media portrayed tried

83
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,389
to pretend my as a loser so that his

84
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,220
success story could be sold okay

85
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,379
I mean obviously I was kind of a loser

86
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,430
but not just like epic loser I was

87
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:45,099
in-between loser

88
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,810
okay there is a thing there is such a

89
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,030
thing don't even try to pretend it isn't

90
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,549
so another thing I mentioned in my past

91
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,919
video was that media always under

92
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,780
evaluates me after all the controversies

93
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,909
before it was like beauty pie make 200

94
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,650
billion and now it's like oh pretty pie

95
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:02,019
made less than I don't know some other

96
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,370
youtuber I'm like I'm pretty sure like I

97
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,859
don't know their personal business or

98
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,150
whatever but I'm pretty sure okay 14

99
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:09,790
billion views okay

100
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,129
14 billion views I mean four billion

101
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,470
sorry but then the Sun was like okay all

102
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:17,560
right well then we over valuate the you

103
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,810
then 54 million in 2019 apparently I

104
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,959
made 54 million guys it's just so crazy

105
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,030
it's every good so it was like

106
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,979
I get that people want to know the exact

107
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,690
number so people are just gonna make up

108
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,860
a bunch of stuff but this thing doesn't

109
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,259
make any sense

110
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,630
it says January I made five point eight

111
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,389
million and then it says it in December

112
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,580
I made two point nine it should be the

113
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,440
opposite because December is usually at

114
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,530
least almost like three or four times

115
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,449
more than January but here they evaluate

116
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,100
January almost twice as much as December

117
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:49,289
like that makes no sense

118
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,710
and what's the brofist logo what does

119
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:55,349
that mean I'm so confused so this study

120
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,910
was based this was based on a study this

121
00:04:55,349 --> 00:05:00,330
research was carried out by online

122
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,580
Marketplace on Viacom what is that they

123
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,370
just link to the website I try to find

124
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,490
the study I cannot find it um Papa

125
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,509
s'more eeeh and I do research I am so

126
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,280
confused

127
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,500
nothing even shows up when I search

128
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,430
PewDiePie but my favorite part of this

129
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,110
article is the little fun fact window

130
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,639
PewDiePie scandal you know in case you

131
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,590
forgot you remember this

132
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,570
huh you remember this you remember this

133
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,580
and then I want forgot about this just

134
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,620
in case you forgot we just in case you

135
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,210
forgot we have to mention this also we

136
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,460
made it a bullet point list just so it's

137
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,740
easier for you to in case you forgot in

138
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,539
caves anyone's forgotten it seems to me

139
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,440
that a lot of times when people bring up

140
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,510
bad things I've done

141
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,740
then fans wants to respond to me like

142
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,210
well actually you know he's done a lot

143
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,889
of positive things like look he's done

144
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,470
charity and then the response is like

145
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:49,020
just because you did charity doesn't

146
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,210
mean it absorbs order yours bad behavior

147
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,979
but it's like well the point is just to

148
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,680
contrast it if you're constantly

149
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,120
bringing up all the negative over and

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,830
over and over then yeah you're gonna

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,389
paint a bad picture that's the whole

152
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,460
point people aren't saying if the

153
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,110
charity he's amazing that's not the

154
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,849
point everybody why you're only allowed

155
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,669
to make one side of the argument you

156
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:11,070
would never see a PewDiePie's charity

157
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,780
deeds or whatever like a list randomly

158
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,729
in an article that's just not happening

159
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,740
that's my point I'm not saying what I

160
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:19,289
did was okay it's just like it's always

161
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,729
there always okay so apparently I made

162
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:22,440
almost three times more than dude

163
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,659
perfect so there you go thank you the

164
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,669

165
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:28,249

184
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:10,669
a week ago that isn't really news I want

185
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,469
to bring this up mainly just to clarify

186
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:15,319
what I said in the video was that I was

187
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:17,539
comparing fan culture from different

188
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,839
going in the more Asian region compared

189
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:22,909
to smaller Scandinavian countries you

190
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,559
know it's very very different so that

191
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,779
made me think that that's a train

192
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:28,009
behavior the reason I was so annoyed in

193
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,019
Malaysia was because people were

194
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,909
literally entering our hotel and it felt

195
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:34,519
like we couldn't leave our hotel because

196
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,169
people were just looking for us and it

197
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,409
felt like we were being hunted almost

198
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:41,149
but I will say you know I was being a

199
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:43,549
bit dishonest when I spoke about

200
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:45,169
Singapore because actually the first

201
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:47,089
time I got recognized in Singapore that

202
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:49,339
was like a huge thing for me because

203
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:52,969
I've never been recognized as a

204
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:54,319
celebrity before quotation mark I don't

205
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:56,419
know if you have footage of that but it

206
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,279
was absolute madness it's something that

207
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,649
I've learned that I I personally don't

208
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,149
enjoy but I would be lying if I said you

209
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:04,009
know I hated it the first time it

210
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,809
happened especially back then as well

211
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,909
because YouTube wasn't really a thing

212
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:11,119
back then it wasn't recognized even by

213
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:13,519
the media or anyone so to see the effect

214
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:15,409
that had on fans was kind of it was kind

215
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,999
of cool to see you know I just wanted to

216
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:18,769
point that out I'm sorry if I was a

217
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:21,529
little harsh to you at Singapore and

218
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:23,629
Malaysia it's not your fault okay like

219
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:24,619
that was fun I'm not gonna lie just so

220
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:30,169
we clear all right

221
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:32,089
Sorry Sorry I'm sorry next juice alright

222
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,099
this is one of my favorite things I've

223
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:38,870
heard it in a while because it's just so

224
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:41,570
funny so there's this new meme called

225
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,849
new guy that trends

226
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,529
this as well when I go to myself new guy

227
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,570
meme trends following controversial

228
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:50,180
PewDiePie comic I'm just like how does

229
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,670
that relate to me I am so confused so

230
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,009
basically what happened was only ng

231
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,199
pointed out that he saw someone else who

232
00:08:55,009 --> 00:09:00,009
made this webcomic and it goes like this

233
00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:02,569
I won't show the artist because it's

234
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:04,850
it's besides the point but basically

235
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:05,839
it's saying hey hey oh what's so funny

236
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,870
new guy

237
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,380
hey that millionaire gamer bro - SH bag

238
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,149
totally got robbed hey hey hey how do

239
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,160
you like it if you were robbed new guy

240
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:17,870
says oh wow I can tell we're gonna be

241
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,060
the kind of co-workers who become good

242
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:25,490
friends wow really

243
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,810
hell nah he'll now the thing is like so

244
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,440
this is the person that made the

245
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,769
webcomic

246
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,500
and this person is trying to vilify a

247
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:35,569
new guy but that person is so tone deaf

248
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,759
they didn't understand that they make

249
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:38,360
themselves look like an idiot it's so

250
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,970
weird

251
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,860
what's the word for it it's so unselfish

252
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,589
this is the first thing I saw today and

253
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,990
people started parroting it saying baka

254
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:53,420
it's not like I wanted to be your friend

255
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:59,420
or anything new guy Oh new guy

256
00:09:53,420 --> 00:10:01,490
later that night Oh new guy if only you

257
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,819
knew we could be so much more than

258
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,860
friends so good great

259
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:10,040
everyone Helga from hey Arnall if you

260
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,380
guys saw that comic new guy empathetic

261
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,079
caring places himself in the shoes of

262
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,100
his fellow man questions sociopathic

263
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:18,139
behavior

264
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,870
it was happy when he thought he made a

265
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,060
friend even one lacking empathy he has

266
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,980
all landmarks of a good protagonist if

267
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,899
he were real he'd make a good friend I

268
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,240
want to be friends with new guy he seems

269
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:31,519
great he's not judging so the artists

270
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,769
also made this comic where she

271
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,209
misinterprets this blonde girl is saying

272
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:37,010
that she has a girlfriend when in

273
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:38,509
reality she just meant that she has a

274
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,519
friend that's a girl and then she

275
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:43,100
follows up with saying okay well sorry

276
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:46,490
but that is infinitely less interesting

277
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,920
to me okay great

278
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:52,040
so let's look at that way I don't use

279
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,050
Twitter anymore how's it work

280
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,870
hashtag new guy I just love had this

281
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,610
spawn this new guy thing how can you not

282
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,590
love him he's so cute

283
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,560
I love how they try to make him as a bad

284
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,690
person and it's just like and I love how

285
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,030
his base of probably a real human

286
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,840
interaction that happened over someone

287
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:14,330
celebrating me getting my house robbed

288
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,610
people who are hurt hurt people ever

289
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,770
since realizing that I swore I would

290
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,650
never hurt anyone the pain ends with me

291
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,480
I really like this message cuz I don't

292
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,580
know anything about this person who

293
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,680
wrote this webcomic and and I really

294
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,360
highly don't want anyone to seek out

295
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,100
this person or anything like that I

296
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,070
think it's more the point here is that

297
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,200
to react in a way that is so I don't

298
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,940
want to boohoo me or whenever I'm

299
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,860
looking at this outside of my own

300
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,050
context but the fact that you know

301
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,330
people who react in this way about

302
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:47,120
something unjust happening to someone to

303
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,640
me is you know it's not normal they I

304
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,250
feel like it's not normal behavior to

305
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,840
react this way I think a lot of times

306
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,240
when people project anger on the

307
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,820
internet or in what towards other people

308
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,380
it sounds like they're probably dealing

309
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,510
with something their own and they're

310
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,250
just lashing out on other things which

311
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,930
it's not new it's always gonna happen

312
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,060
you know I sound like that guy we're

313
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,300
really haters hate themselves you know

314
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:13,970
but there's a clear distinction to me

315
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,460
wishing actual harm on someone or

316
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,560
something illegal to happen to someone

317
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,930
as a way to celebrate it even if you

318
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,180
don't like him it's not normal to want

319
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,430
that to happen to someone genuinely like

320
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,710
haha that's the weird part of me and and

321
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:30,080
and how that line is blurred because I'm

322
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,760
a millionaire apparently when it's not

323
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,500
about the money it's about the personal

324
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,210
space and it's weird how no one

325
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,160
understands that and that's what new

326
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,840
guy's saying it's like well you wouldn't

327
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,550
like it if it happened to you so yeah

328
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,260
man I'm explaining to this poor late but

329
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,940
I hope you understand hey there's really

330
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,770
hate themselves with the point of new

331
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,740
guy is that just understanding that yen

332
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,510
just because people who are hurt hurt

333
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,670
other people doesn't mean you have to

334
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,760
attack them back you know even if they

335
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,770
have a bad take or a bad idea so now you

336
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,340
have this comics about this person being

337
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:03,080
canceled insult but new guy steps in I

338
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,690
was created to be the part of an

339
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,430
insensitive joke but through love

340
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:11,120
and kindness you turned me into

341
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,640
something amazing for 20/20 new guy new

342
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,240
guy I just also like it because it's

343
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,860
clearly gone so overboard a lot of these

344
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,320
back and forth interactions on it on the

345
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,360
internet that it's it's nice to see just

346
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,980
someone be like all right from now on no

347
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,560
more of this you know so yeah there's a

348
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,030
ton of really funny fine arts and comics

349
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,550
about there's new and memes about this

350
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,890
new guy I also like this person who

351
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,170
pointed out just how shape language

352
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:39,140
usually aggressive and active is

353
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,880
triangular and static and trustworthy

354
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,890
are square shape so they literally just

355
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,840
made themself into a villain and this

356
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,630
person they try to make it as a bad

357
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,760
person as somewhat trustworthy it's so

358
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,680
unintentional and tone-deaf that it it

359
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,020
created this really strange phenomena

360
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,550
which I endorse I think it's great when

361
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,900
you're supposed to be the dumb guy but

362
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,900
at the end you turn into the good guy

363
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,260
