00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,000
heart is ball game that's good that's

24
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,920

27
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,450
the reasoning behind women who won't

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,210
take their husband's last name because

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,310
my last name is best that's great

30
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,420
no that's the Sully pun I would actually

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:32,040
marry someone just to get that name

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:34,020

one of the most common names in the

35
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,729
world

36
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,360
David Brown what's a little fun fact

43
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,350
one of the things you had that's working

top-tier petty

49
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,300
if only I had a garage then I would be

50
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,040
successful too

51
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,230
this name was not in my garage that's a

52
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,940

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:30,070
like nice houses okay privilege I've

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,800

for our kids and for their future nice

59
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:45,340
you don't need too much bro you're

60
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:47,530
littering I get it but at the same like

61
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,780
its nicest leaders participating but at

62
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,480
the same he's gotta change some people's

63
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,850
minds but yet technically I appreciate

64
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,780
the Nick on camera strap with it oh it's

65
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:00,160
a camera I don't even notice oh I mean I

66
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:08,770
knew that I mean you're allowed to use

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:10,360
this jar okay telling a dangerously

68
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,980
overweight person not to lose weight

69
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,990
because they're beautiful it's like

70
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,360
telling an alcoholic not to stop

71
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:20,410
drinking because they're fun this is

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,360
true well I think that's just true where

73
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,550
does the technically start coming in I

74
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,200
yeah all right that's a good point like

75
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,910
this isn't annoying me in anyway it's

76
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,870
not like yeah suppose you're right it's

77
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:33,370
like yeah that's correct

78
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,830
small peepee question mark am I allowed

79
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,810
to designate peepee size or is that just

80
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,050
exclusive to you no no you're full of

81
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,440
gang absolutely okay small peepee next

82
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,440
that's all good

83
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:51,370
once you get a taste of that small

84
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,530
peepee power would you eat six donuts

85
00:03:51,370 --> 00:04:00,100
honestly my takeaway from this chart is

86
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:05,410
that donuts actually true for me what do

87
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:09,900
you mean I didn't know no energy drink

88
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:17,290
oh my god you're right now I see it what

89
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:18,970
I think yeah okay still I think sugar

90
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,100
does worse than fat cuz a bunch of sugar

91
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,610
companies paid nevermind this is getting

92
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,860
too late

93
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:28,500
no I think you're right okay when does a

94
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:33,390
joke become a dad joke when it becomes

95
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,700
apparent technically the truth not

96
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,590
mildly infuriating but this is uh yeah

97
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,710
thank you link for nothing

98
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,240
waving verified link and assuming that

99
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,700
guys from Fire Emblem they're all from

100
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,720
Fire Emblem on they yeah Nintendo

101
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:52,140
Twitter never trusted lamps in video

102
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,360
games are using real electricity I like

103
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:58,940
this way my brain too small explain it

104
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:03,360
how does a PC or games console function

105
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,500
okay all right okay this is peak I think

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,790
this should have been the top of all

107
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,340
time this is brilliant

108
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,990
that's very technically the truth I want

109
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,460
to find a flaw in this no it's just true

110
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:18,360
this doesn't feel satisfying you know

111
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,650
why not it's like I don't know yeah

112
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,750
alright you're right it's like if

113
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,800
someone tells a joke that isn't fun yeah

114
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,750
I guess that was a joke

115
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,070
feels like a dad joke like uh yeah

116
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,660
alright yeah ok

117
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,710
we should definitely download all the

118
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:37,140
puns ok that wasn't a plan damn it so we

119
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,570
have Mexico Egypt and Indonesia from

120
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,669
three different places what does this

121
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,980
mean that my friend is exactly the

122
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,440
question you have to ask it means that

123
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,620
this is one of the best ways to pile up

124
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,630
rocks and not have them fall tough

125
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:55,080
that's really satisfying someone just

126
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,210
being sensible there oh my god yes so

127
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,610
many people believe like oh my god alien

128
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,830
the Egypt's like aliens yeah that's

129
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,010
gotta be in a coincidence they saw some

130
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,710
video or something right that's

131
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:11,560
something that's yeah coincidental but

132
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:14,840
can be risk his explaining the basics

133
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,640
[Laughter]

134
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,890
alright get on that Shane come on stop

135
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,140
making water videos Millennials aren't

136
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:26,370
buying diamonds why I can already answer

137
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,990
yeah it's like you in the picture there

138
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,430
no it does kind of look like me to be

139
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,650
sipping that java application to ask

140
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,220
them to attach their resume and then

141
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,710

privileged Thanks I mean yes then that's

145
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:52,870
the better attitude that was another one

146
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,520
of the things that was a marketing

147
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,380
campaign to make people feel guilty for

148
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,420
not spending money right you have to

149
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:02,460
spend a third three months of your

150
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,460
salary on a dime and do that did you

151
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,730
[Laughter]

152
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,610
what exactly is the consequences of

153
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,200
being wrong about climate change even if

154
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,420
it all turned out to be a big mistake

155
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,190
oh no we've frickin made the world a

156
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,080
healthier and better place to live and

00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,880
multiply 3 by 0.3 33 we get zero point

185
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,089
nine nine nine so what happened to zero

186
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,590
point zero zero one find it on the knife

187
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:52,040
oh thanks well

188
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:55,279
like the knife that's yeah that's how

189
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,320
rounding works as brilliant every single

190
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,450
a time in maths that there's like

191
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,730
top-tier mathematicians in the world now

192
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,620
using we find it on the knife I know

193
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,230
there's a bunch of annoying like math

194
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,330
things were like oh and one is actually

195
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,220
equals two if you do it like this just

196
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:15,850
add maths they don't yeah and maths the

197
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:18,350
idiots all right for the record right

198
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,330
chicken can't afford an umbrella so she

199
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,060
uses her wings she can't afford an

200
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:30,140
umbrella what she used her wings to keep

201
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:33,650
her chicks out of the rain yeah

202
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:36,620
technically she cannot afford that oh my

203
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:43,060
god I like how this is kind of hurting

204
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:46,240
you yeah I mean if she sold her chickens

205
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,770
she could afford a and that's legal

206
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,350
technically she could do that yes it

207
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:54,050
yeah so you're wrong David Bell in

208
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:56,870
reality plants are actually farming us

209
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,940
by giving us oxygen daily until we all

210
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:03,950
eventually decompose so they can consume

211
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:07,160
us I knew it I'm being in that or the

212
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:09,560
conspiracy I'm vegan wait if we can't I

213
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,330
hate plants that's a great concept see

214
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,980
this is a great reason for why we need

215
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,190
to keep destroying the earth because

216
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,490
otherwise we'll destroy us we can't let

217
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,860
the plants win guys come on calm planet

218
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,230
the planets plants actually feel pain I

219
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,690
remember I've heard about that yeah yes

220
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,730
of vegans I still like petting creatures

221
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,060
that seems like the Fedora version of

222
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:38,930
like its earlier VR you're vegan do you

223
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:43,010
know plants feel pain yes yes you're not

224
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:45,050
so sympathetic after all huh no I used

225
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,200
to be one of those proper auntie vegan

226
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,880
kids growing up when I went through ants

227
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,890
with my friends and even though veganism

228
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,390
was a thing when I was growing up I had

229
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,529
quite a few vegan friends when I went to

230
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,060
restaurants and they bought like a

231
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,800
vegetarian or vegan thing I would get

232
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,310
like the meat platter because I wasn't

233
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,310
at all

234
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:10,510
so out of character yeah I've changed

235
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,790
significantly hopefully it's like that

236
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,120
one clip of the guy who eats at steak in

237
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:21,160
front of their vegan right so that was

238
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,839
me I thought I was so cool I can't even

239
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,230
matter to begin being annoyed by that

240
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:31,690
unless you're right most of the time so

241
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:37,750
yeah it's like so are you vegan named

242
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:41,200
every Dave diet reveal that's the title

243
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:44,200
of this video now a single sperm has 37

244
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,649
point 5 megabytes of DNA information in

245
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,990
it

246
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:50,260
that means that a normal ejaculation

247
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,060
represent a data transfer of 1.5 hundred

248
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,450
oh one thousand five hundred and eighty

249
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,839
seven point five terrible that's a lotta

250
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:01,209
information to swallow oh yeah that's a

251
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,709
good joke I appreciate that you know

252
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:07,870
it's a good joke when I say out loud

253
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:09,250
it's a good joke yeah right it is

254
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,589
fascinating though how you can measure

255
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,220
the amount of data that can go on yeah

256
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:17,079
it's so far ahead of us biology it shows

257
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,010
how limited we are as a species as well

258
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:22,110
that's literally it

259
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,110
right if anything the plants should

260
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:29,980
right well I don't know how much that a

261
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:34,149
plant can I just meant like compared to

262
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:37,300
a computer Agnetha and I'm only 15 just

263
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:42,130
into Singh age 58 what's your Excuse I'm

muscle at that age that does not work

266
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,220
that dude looks like a like a character

267
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,320
from a fighting game dude he looks

268
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,329
straight out of Joe you submit oh you're

269
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,760

allow it

279
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,110
that's fine if it's an epic win like

280
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,240
that yeah against the epic man himself

281
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:30,700
that's got a war a swearword t-shirt is

282
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,680
always an epic win car companies always

283
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,330
advertise how quickly their cars go from

284
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,950
zero to a hundred but not a hundred to

285
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,680
zero even though it's a lot more

286
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,930
important that's a good point it's too

287
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:47,500
easy to cheat in that category by using

288
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:49,900
a wall I hate the subreddit now no Tom

289
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:55,170
chocolate tastes way better than theirs

290
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:58,630
so why don't talk lane oh yeah oh yeah

291
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,820

292
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,410
technically the truth yeah I don't care

293
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,630

you're buying or watching Amazon I

301
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,690
learned the hard way that if it says you

302
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:35,830
can swim with it this only applies if

303
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:42,520

done this too much like you think so

308
00:14:52,120 --> 00:15:01,900
yeah there must have been a time in your

309
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:05,140
life where you to read that and $2.00 is

310
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:07,090

technically the truth not really funny

314
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:19,790
no see they always seem to like that do

315
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:23,490
twins have the same size peepee

316
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:25,560
now we're asking the real questions as a

317
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:30,600
twin I can say my peepee is definitely

318
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:34,890

that's literally actually me with my

324
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,160
sega's scheanette she doesn't drink a

325
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,490
lot even water I don't know how she does

326
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,520
it

327
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:55,920
that's what that sounds really unhealthy

328
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,260
yeah I don't know oh nice

329
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,770
cheers to you I don't know how she does

330
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,900
it she's not human we'll find out in

331
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:06,690
1977 we received a radio signal from

332
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,280
space that lasted 72 seconds and to this

333
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,340
day we still don't know where it came

334
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,340
from

335
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,990
dumbass is that one of those things

336
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,810
that's just everyone thinks is true but

337
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,840
it's not true at all I feel like it is

338
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,910
or that it's been already like explained

339
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,820
yeah exactly yeah it is funny though

340
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:29,600
because on there on the first satellite

341
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:39,030
that we sent out they may like this

342
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:40,950
pictures in them yeah yeah what's that

343
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,360
satellite call I guess it makes sense to

344
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,920
do it have math equations and stuff

345
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,780
right shows and tell yeah that's where

346
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,840
they had pictures of humans they've got

347
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,470
DNA down there oh wow oh wow that's so

348
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,980
cool

349
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,510
Hey look hideous find this oh and

350
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,040
there's someone twerking down there is

351
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,160
that what the hell is nice well what's

352
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,830
the point of adding centimeters why I

353
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,360
guess like comparable and then it's

354
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,420
kilograms like showing the weight I

355
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,690
guess I guess seconds makes sense right

356
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,600
yeah it's for measuring stuff what's

357
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:15,540
that seconds for what like how long they

358
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,210
live what I think so yeah how developed

359
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,310
it is I like this drawing someone had to

360
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:23,280
draw alright so we need you to draw like

361
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,620
this sick ass frog dude this is what

362
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,750
aliens will see they'll be like what the

363
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:36,710
small peepee

364
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:38,270
I think I Rama y know what these are the

365
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:47,720
things they chose to include all this

366
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:49,190
stuff the aliens think oh this is just

367
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,910
how they consume things all the time

368
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:55,100
pouring it from a gigantic blast for the

369
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,740
meetup ceremony then start pouring down

370
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,780
water I'm surprised no company like paid

371
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,670
to get their stuff in this oh my god

372
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,680
you're right there's so much with that

373
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,080
who's the real queen of the sea let's

374
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,090
argue Mona left her family to save her

375
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:20,720
village and the ocean area left her

376
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:22,490
family for Marin fare my son was just

377
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,960
born and another dad at the nursery

378
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,670
congratulated me and said his daughter

379
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,230

00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:44,210
marry each other sure like my son is

381
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:46,310
gonna marry someone twice his age to be

382
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,600
honest it's not premarital sex if you

383
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,870
never get married

384
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,490
I thoroughly appreciate this one she

385
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,230
found a loophole yeah yeah

386
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,240
does that mean you wouldn't be sinning

387
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,110
isn't it weird how we pay money to see

388
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,000
other people

389
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:03,800
you mean prostitution concerts or the

390
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,980
movies glasses nice I like the fake Jim

391
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,440
and they set this up just for him

392
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,750
you mean right all right I saw my boy

393
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,200
cry across the bar tell some girl he

394
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:18,190
travels for work that man that's smooth

395
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,260
that got me more than it should have

396
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:25,010
it's still smooth technically true take

397
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:28,160
a tree I love that take out means dating

398
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,900
and murder take him out if you're a

399
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,290
praying mantis it can be all three at

400
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,450
once

401
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:37,890
oh yeah cuz they yeah all right dating

402
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,440
technically a praying mantis cannot

403
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,970
understand the concept of dating okay

404
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,700
your shoes are on the wrong feet

405
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,530
I don't have any other feet fair enough

406
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,360
I feel like this was one of those things

407
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:52,800
that some parent pretended that child

408
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,300
said all right yeah look at my child how

409
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,190
quirky yeah

410
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,470
what a fun view they have on life I wish

411
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:02,910
I was yes they enjoy jokes like that

412
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:06,920
happy you're painting the answer like

413
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:12,030
the word just cuz I don't like a joke

414
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:13,620
I'm not saying that all right I think

415
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:17,010
you're happier than I expected you to be

416
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,810
like you from knowing you like from a

417
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,940
distance my assumption was that you

418
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:23,490
would have some like making this kind of

419
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,260
thing so regularly I thought yeah surely

420
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,480
he's depressed then I met you I'm like

421
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,010
oh god he's not well it is making me

422
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,510
more depressed as we go so you're not

423
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:35,280
wrong one time I went to hand someone a

424
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,500
bowl of hot soup and my brain tried to

425
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,060
say careful it's hot and here's your

426
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:44,220
soup so instead I bloated Apple too

427
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:46,590
careful it's ooh yeah you should be

428
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,930
careful if it is hot okay let's see

429
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,760
what's on your mind it's freaking weird

430
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,180
that in order to go to sleep you have to

431
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,670
pretend like you're as seen this yeah I

432
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,740
don't pretend that I'm sleeping

433
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:01,380
technically a lie technically falls and

434
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:05,610
ER get the flip out of here small peepee

guarantee you yeah

442
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,550

he when they're right he was under a

444
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,760
tree on the floor yeah that's what

445
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,380
people say when that out in like the

446
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,780
park or something I'm going for a walk

447
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,700
on the floor what's that what's the

448
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:45,030
other one with the water they yell at

449
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,200
Eureka and it was in a bathtub that's

450
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,820
floor yeah

451
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,100
he jumps out of the bathtub onto the

452
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,220
floor

453
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:58,230
behind a fire famously walked on the

454
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:58,230
floor oh this is like a pyramid yeah

455
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,679
except knows the truth nothing

456
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,020
worthwhile has been discovered sitting

457
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:07,570
down I think on it on a chair I think

458
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:10,030
that's the thing we know absolutely not

459
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,549
being a serial killer is much like being

460
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,860
a comedian in that you either hit it big

461
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:20,110
and yet your own Netflix special or you

462
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:25,179
spend eternity popping up on this is

463
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:28,150
great oh that's so true but I do feel

464
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:30,340
like they all show up anyway right it's

465
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,679
so weird how like no one has a problem

466
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,200
with like making serial killers super

467
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,640
famous wait I missed a point being a

468
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,500
snare kill as much like being a comedian

469
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,020
right it's a real jerk

470
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,850
that's clever yeah that's the first

471
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:50,440
really clever joke we've come across it

472
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:52,480
yeah yeah yeah okay so I'm not the only

understand the subreddit weasel I got

478
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:09,549

479
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,510

480
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:15,490
