great don't touch it don't ruin it don't

198
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,150
touch it don't ruin it taking a break

199
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,950
because of fatigue taking a break to

200
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,720
grow out of beard without the awkward

201
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,520
middle of stage I was actually thinking

202
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,870
about that it could be a good time to

203
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:25,090
grow out of my beard damn it oh how do I

204
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:27,430
have that power I don't understand when

205
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:35,860
you see your favorite youtuber yelling

206
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:38,230
at you confuse happiness I would I

207
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,820
explained in another video that I was

208
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,980
going to do this but Marsha has stopped

209
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,990
in me by rolling up the window YouTube

210
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,610
rewind should have parodied a vendor's

211
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,360
end game with all the youtubers going

212
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,700
back to fix rewind that is so sad and

213
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,210
the Internet has the best ideas that's a

214
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,580
great idea

215
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:59,260
what a loss of virginity that's so good

216
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,920
oh my god I was so funny you can see it

217
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,780
in front of me

218
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,910
you could have Elon Musk in it being our

219
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:07,390
actual Iron Man I'm sure he'd be down to

220
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:10,690
it my crippling depression from not

221
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:17,620
getting a comment Edgar the Pug but damn

222
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:19,420
is it me or is it me and the boys

223
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,400
appearing one more time before the

224
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,040
decade ends all right there it is gamers

225
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,560
there it is a good pirate never takes

226
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,950
another person's property isn't this a

227
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,110
paradox that means a bad pirate takes

228
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,000
another person's property but that makes

229
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:41,650
a bad pirate a good pirate because

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:44,560
that's what I mean trying to get this

231
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,340
last pivot do you feel out I can strong

232
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
that's big enough

233
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,810
PewDiePie quits YouTube saying he's too

234
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,390
tired to go on amazing every word of

235
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:56,200
what he said is wrong you did it mirror

236
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:58,120
you did it whenever I see these fake

237
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,200
stories I'm just like have they always

238
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,780
been fake or is it now that it's become

239
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,040
worse you know what it makes you

240
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,170
question sort of what

241
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,390
they're stories that you heard we're

242
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,010
wrong and growing up right

243
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,200
I remember hearing about Michael Jackson

244
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,570
gonna guerrilla or something like that

245
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,470

just felt like I was wasting time and it

252
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,200
was it's not a productive side and I

253
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,390
don't want to support it since the N

254
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:47,020
