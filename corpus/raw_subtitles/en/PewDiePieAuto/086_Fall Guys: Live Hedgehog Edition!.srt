you're gonna get a seesaw

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,440

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,520
to show you don't have beer and finally

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,039

again it's the most disgusting thing

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,319
i've seen because his butt looks like

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
his face so he looks like he was pooping

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,239
from his mouth

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,440

he will definitely go through this i'm

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,440
thinking like where should we place it

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,680
i think he should like go up the sofa

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,720
and then slide down

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,120
front flip up the seesaw you know what i

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,640

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,360
fast

96
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,360

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,599
hedgehog

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,280

101
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,280
