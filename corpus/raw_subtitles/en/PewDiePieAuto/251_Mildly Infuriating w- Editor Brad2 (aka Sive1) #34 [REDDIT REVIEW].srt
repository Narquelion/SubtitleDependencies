34
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,040
breaking wait that's the actual course

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,880
of the site yeah

36
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,799

even gotten started

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759

145
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,040
praise

146
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,320

148
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,360
specific area yeah a lot of people do

149
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,880
that they're like oh this is so great

150
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,240
unlike google maps and stuff and you

151
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
just get like two out of five and then

152
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,280
the review is like oh this is amazing

153
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,560

158
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,800

159
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,880
white black asian gay

160
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,560

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
the only time i've been in a car

192
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,800
accident was when i drove

193
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,160
to get like a cable that i desperately

194
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,319

you went into a car accident yeah

196
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
because i left

197
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,199
so i went to this kid's store and

198
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,400

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,240
do

248
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,960
[Music]

good job we literally had this with brad

252
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,080
one it was the same thing like the

253
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,599
reddit we reviewed

254
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,279

258
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,919
infuriating it was a social sciences

259
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,279

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,040
oh okay

261
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,399
if it was a science or math degree you'd

262
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,920

263
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,360
