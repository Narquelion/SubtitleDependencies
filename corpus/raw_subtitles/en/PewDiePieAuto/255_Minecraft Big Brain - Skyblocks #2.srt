15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,909
the very start of the whole video it

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,560
just took us 24 I actually some some

17
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,659
kids recognize me and they were like

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:22,409

like you want more of that I was like do

20
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,130
you have it like if so how to make a

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,380
cobblestone generator and then they were

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,240
like I don't know I'm like okay cool no

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,100
one actually nobody actually knows they

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:39,659
just like now now we make here you get

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:43,110
one pickaxe - oh yes senpai let's mine

26
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,430
the freaked out of this yeah I don't

27
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:50,430
know why I thought it would wake up with

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:53,430
two of us that makes enough yeah thank

29
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,899
you for for me we're speedrunning this

30
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,930
there you go alright yeah

31
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,320
can she believe a Smee but here takes a

32
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,649
kit what what's wrong would have to

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,939
invent new swear words because minecraft

34
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:09,030
well you start using the word flip what

35
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,430
the flip can't dig the dirt you know

36
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,970
that'd be bad okay don't like craps down

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,190
to pick this up or something

38
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,990
oh my god you're still back I am okay

39
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,880
well I can't ever pick up stuff I won't

40
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,700
burn myself a lot you can get like the

41
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,500
right spot you know this is like an art

42
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,030
okay wait I'll do it I'll do it because

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I think it's easier for me to grab them

44
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,410
yeah I guess yeah

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,600
the desync that's what I blame anybody

46
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,040
using the using the precious dirt to

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,220
make a bridge right now are you serious

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,760
I need I need a baby are you serious I

49
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,160
need you using the dirt right now we

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,420
need to get back to where we were when

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,150
we get over there we're gonna have to

52
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,640
like make a farm or something we I can't

53
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,050
believe you right now like am I crazy

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,120
but I think our cobblestone generator

55
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:56,440
was actually better it was weirdly

56
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,120
enough you could actually catch it

57
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,860
without it you didn't have to worry

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,170
about breaking your dirt or anything you

59
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,200
just used to went to town yeah I'll put

60
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,450
the stuff in years it's easier I could

61
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,550
never seen the memes they shouldn't

62
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,050
there wasn't good news I just thought

63
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,090
however almost like this are you doing

64
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,790
more like yet all right but we did it

65
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,920
the good way yeah but did you see ours

66
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,989
though how good it was so what are we

67
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,470
supposed to do next it's like what we'll

68
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,239
see Ken we'll see okay well me okay cuz

69
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,340
I'll see more blocks out here I mean

70
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,840
technically we can make infinite blocks

71
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,640
now so there has to be some other

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,650
mechanic to it right all right well I

73
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,850
mean don't we just after we get the

74
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,200
cobblestone you're pretty much this

75
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,330
guy's survivor right it's gotta use what

76
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,220
we have I don't know what's the point of

77
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,720
Skyblock really we've already beaten it

78
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:46,930
I miss our cobblestone generator so much

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,290
you can never recreate art that's a

80
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:54,010
problem all right we're good

81
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,150
bing-bing-bing-bing whoa I know how you

82
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,660

83
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,570

89
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,680

92
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,670
there's a whole lesson right

93
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,090
okay so that means we need flint and

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,900

136
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:25,610
I am spread out spread a problem I have

137
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,390
an idea we should spread out as much as

138
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,370
possible

139
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,010
oh good thinking yeah

140
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,560
yeah so how deep this is go three

141
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,760
there's a mmmm I don't know how we get

142
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,389
the very bottom pieces though without

143
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:41,300
them falling off maybe do everything

144
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,610
it's getting bigger I like it yeah yeah

145
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,150
I like what he gets bigger wait I can't

146
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:54,080
we're playing minecraft minecraft sake

147
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:55,910
ah just play we need to pick the lava

148
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,889
back up so we can dig around and I don't

149
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,080
know is the answer when will you have to

150
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:04,400
use our big brains magnet then do we

151
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,700
have to like oh dang it I lost one sorry

152
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm sorry I'm sorry

153
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,880
oh my goodness your mom okay we're gonna

154
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,760
it's over playthrough over

155
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,940
no I'm worried about more trees don't

156
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,190
worry I got you more tree yeah you know

157
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,660
if we started planting trees then we

158
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,389
would actually have like epic trees

159
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,740
right now but no do we want to let me

160
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,840
such a pain to get enough cobblestone

161
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,090
and go under this so we don't drop any

162
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,250
and make the most of our space that we

163
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,360
have yeah we are moving everything from

164
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,800
the bottom up we just move everything

165
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,150
from the top down so that way we don't

166
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,889
worry about the bottom blocks falling

167
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:42,740
into the void now that's a bigger brain

168
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:44,750
yeah I think it's too late for that now

169
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,910
though we should know that before a

170
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,130
cobblestone generator will work out with

171
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,720
it what if we make cobblestones well we

172
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,400
still need turn the darkness for the

173
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,720
farming if we make cobblestone I don't

174
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:00,169
have a pick anymore since that not me

175
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:02,690
off oh oh the water Oh garsh

176
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:04,700
I think we have some good space yeah

177
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:08,080
last night we party started perfect or

178
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:11,450
anything gamers but do it pro gameplay

179
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:15,770
wait retching how the Frick did we get

180
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:19,430
flint and steel ah I see a question big

181
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:22,280

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,020
I'd be careful this block right here if

212
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,279
you want to get unless you want to get a

213
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,290

215
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,980

216
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:13,050

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,000
use a cactus I'll ever talk back about

362
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:13,810
cactus

363
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:23,800
alright wait I actually haven't good

364
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:25,990
stuff well now I can die when you forget

365
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,939
to write your last will if you if you

366
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,470
look up Skyblock there's like a list of

367
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:30,910
challenges it's like stuff to do like

368
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,190
stuff to challenge yourself to do

369
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,360
because this cow block is literally just

370
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,980
you know the two blocks that's it

371
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,510
everything else is just gonna make it on

372
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,400
your own right so there's no more

373
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,770
islands I don't think so

374
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,180
I think that's it they just get too and

375
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,500
then they're like good luck if you get

376
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,090
to the second island so you can get food

377
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,560
and actually survive then you spread the

378
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,450
dirt out and then from there you're just

379
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,530
like you're just surviving until you can

380
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,060
go to the nether and do whatever in

381
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,860
there but how would you go to the nether

382
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,490

to wait for like a lava flip to hit the

401
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:51,580
thing really yeah big brain I guess one

402
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,010

yeah I think it's gonna work right okay

409
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:22,360

Lama needs to flow on this level we

built that I built him sitting him too

433
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,420
too far down so we need to lower

434
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:52,240
everything and the only way to do that

435
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:55,480
is if I jump off and I place the block

436
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,830
while falling big brain why don't we

437
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:10,510

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,640
everything are you kidding me you need

451
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:08,690

throw the LOB on top of the wood will it

457
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:24,530

bucket down or something before you die

461
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:43,340
with it I have a big brain right now

462
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:45,290
yeah I'm gonna finish to eat more lava

463
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,750
means more flipper dippers right

464
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,790
you go try me more lava more lava we may

465
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:54,250
use it here we should probably protect

466
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,250
little tree I mean we already lost melon

467
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,830
oh sorry

468
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,900
okay well eventually something should

469
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:09,260
catch on fire right yeah this is this is

470
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,450
big oh I see it oh that was close well

471
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:15,290
place more wood so that it's more likely

472
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,250
to catch on fire right are you okay yeah

473
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,280
I'm fine

474
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,500
okay so ice I put the random and then

475
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,450
once they're on fire we'll connect them

476
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,070
Christian mark everything my big brain

477
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,510

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,720
did like dig the two out and then just

479
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,100
put

480
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,260
would over the top of it and then just

481
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,680

487
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,700
a new idea I don't feel so good I have a

488
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:57,830

why does tree not grow we did bone meal

495
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,890
for tree I guess you know we could get

496
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,810
bone meal if we actually had like enough

497
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,300
surface area to her bad gas bond that we

498
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:24,970
could like the bad guys dropped for it

499
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,970
oh my god I have a big brain idea boy

500
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:31,760
bad guys can only spawn when there is no

501
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:34,790
when there's light darkness so we should

502
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,760
make a platform over there and cover it

503
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:40,520
with from light so get brain so they oh

504
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,340

what we just need to kill them they

539
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:26,660
spawn first
