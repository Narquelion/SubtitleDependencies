00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
hello it's time for me to share one of

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,400
my most

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,360
deepest darkest saddest

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,759
stories that i ever held inside and not

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,799
told

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,960
anyone in over 15 years

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,960
that's right i broke my ass

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,359
it's not something i'm proud of and i'm

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,000
only making this video

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,560
to make sure that this happens to no one

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,039
else

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,880
i was young i was foolish and this could

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,000
happen to anyone do you know where your

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,239
ass is right now

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,200
you have to be aware at all times

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,239
otherwise

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,559
you run the risk of experiencing

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,399
the same pain i did long long long ago

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,120
i'm making this video because i made a

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,520
promise in a video a couple years ago i

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,160
said

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,399
i admitted that i broke my ass i'll tell

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,120
people in the future about this story

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,039
and i finally gathered enough courage i

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,559
finally gathered enough strength

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,570
to tell my story about how i broke my

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,840
ass

[Music]

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,200
i'm really appreciative people

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,240
gave me their respect and support for

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,439
doing this

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,520
it's not easy to talk about

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,880
but i will do my best to stay strong

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,439
throughout this video

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,560
[Music]

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,360
when i was 15 in sweden i was an awkward

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,479
swedish

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,759
weird underdeveloped little child

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,680
that's right everyone i used to be the

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,280
short kid you think i'm insecure about

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
my height for no reason

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
this has nothing to do with the story

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,880
i'm just giving context i didn't like

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,960
interacting with people i would prefer

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,720
to just sit home and play video games

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,520
i know the perfect cliche of a nerdy kid

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,479
nevertheless during summer we didn't

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,960
have a computer

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,240
at our summer place i had completely

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,560
different friend group there

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,000
there was basically internet was

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,759
non-existent so

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,280
i had no other choice but to hang out

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,080
and socialize with people

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,520
so even though i was a weird awkward kid

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,160
two months a year i

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
became a normal swedish boy i became a

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,520
summer child

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,720
and actually went out partying and did

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
all the stuff you do

62
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,120
so one week during the summer there's a

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,599
it's called sailing week i think

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,160
where everyone or a lot of people rent a

65
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,560
boat

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,760
they go sailing and they go from harbor

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
to harbor

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,519
and they get drunk and party so

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,400
me and my friends rented a sailing boat

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
altogether

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,680
well i think i think i was 50. i don't

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,080
know exactly how old i was

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
but me and my uh two closest friends we

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,840
rented a boat to

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
do basically just this i don't know why

76
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,080
my parents thought this was a good idea

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,440
i definitely would not let my kids do

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,440
this especially

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,959
mine with what we did i'm not gonna go

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,480
into details but i know what you're

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,440
thinking wow felix you have so many

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,920
amazing talents

83
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,920
you must be really good at sailing oh

84
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,640
yeah i was actually a sailing instructor

85
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,319
at one point

86
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,920
not really i mean i was a sailing

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,480
instructor but i was goddamn awful at

88
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
sailing

89
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,920
i really just got the job thanks for my

90
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,120
mom thanks mom i remember uh

91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,720
during the so it was basically me and a

92
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
bunch of really young kids

93
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,239
and then during the beginning of the

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,080
course we asked like who wants to stay

95
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,920
up with felix and all the kids when yeah

96
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,360
me me me and i'm like yay i'm finally

97
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,599
popular with kids

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
kids like me this is great and then at

99
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,000
the end of the course

100
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
they ask the same question who wants to

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
stay with felix today

102
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,400
no one complete silence no one wanted to

103
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
say it with me all the kids hated me

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,640
because i wasn't good at sailing and we

105
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
kept capsizing and i kept lashing out on

106
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,080
all the kids because they sucked at

107
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,000
sailing and how is that my fault i'm

108
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,360
just the instructor

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,200
i also won one sailing uh

110
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,879
competition once which wasn't really a

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
sailing competition but it's one of

112
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,400
those things that i carried with me

113
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,480
throughout these 15 years and go

114
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,239
yeah i'm good at sailing i'm not good at

115
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,400
sailing and i'm willing to admit that

116
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,239
nevertheless we went sailing me and a

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,000
couple friends and it was a great time

118
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,640
we we partied and that was it

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,799
the problem is i get really really

120
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,959
really motion sick or seasick and anyone

121
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,159
that gets seasick you know how awful it

122
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,280
is it

123
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,919
stays with you until you get out of the

124
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,320
boat

125
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,400
it doesn't leave you for all this time

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,479
and it seems impossible to get rid of

127
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,639
you just want to die and it's not a good

128
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,680
feeling i didn't like the feeling

129
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,479
so i thought okay i'm gonna come

130
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,960
prepared

131
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,479
so i bought this motion sickness tablet

132
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,800
which is supposed to help with it

133
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,479
but they came with two side effects that

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,040
i was not intending for

135
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,479
number one it made me extremely sleepy

136
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,440
for some reason we had these weird

137
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,080
regulations in sweden where

138
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,840
with drugs i guess we don't really have

139
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
sleeping pills like in america

140
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,880
a lot of times what doctors do is that

141
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,240
instead of giving you sleeping pills

142
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,160
they say hey just take these motion

143
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
sickness tablets they do the same thing

144
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
and i didn't know about this so i

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,080
remember one time one of the days

146
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,680
during the sailing week it was so stormy

147
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
outside i remember looking outside be

148
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,280
like oh my god i'm gonna die from

149
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,120
seasickness if i go out on this

150
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,400
so i just downed a bunch of these motion

151
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,000
sickness tablets

152
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,759
being like it's not gonna happen to me

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,039
yeah i basically just drugged myself as

154
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,759
hard as i could

155
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,520
completely passed out i don't know how

156
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,240
long i was out but i remember

157
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,160
i was waking up way later in the evening

158
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
being super confused i didn't know where

159
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,800
i was

160
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,400
i looked outside i thought we arrived in

161
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
the new harbor realizing

162
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,000
we didn't even leave the shore everyone

163
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,000
was too afraid to sail that day

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,160
so i basically just drugged myself for

165
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,680
no reason but felix we want to hear how

166
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
you broke your ass well i'm getting

167
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,880
there

168
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,840
okay papa needs some watch time there's

169
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,600
another symptom

170
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,520
that i haven't mentioned yet and that

171
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,759
symptom is balance

172
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,039
that's right motion sickness is

173
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,280
connected to your ear

174
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,199
which is connected to your balance so i

175
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,919
would say or at least i like to think

176
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,639
that that's why my balance wasn't the

177
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,280
pristine

178
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,199
top condition that it's usually in i can

179
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,919
stand on one leg probably longer than

180
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,639
any other

181
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,800
person alive i pride myself in having

182
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,960
extremely well balanced

183
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,880
in everything thanos catchphrase

184
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,360
perfectly balanced as all things should

185
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
be

186
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,800
was actually invented by me i have

187
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,680
amazing balance

188
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,479
but taking these pills it knocked over

189
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639
my balance

190
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,319
then we were also on this boat drinking

191
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,160
obviously as we were sailing

192
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,639
and that knocked down a few points on my

193
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,639
balance

194
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,319
scale as well and i think you know where

195
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,199
i'm going

196
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,319
with this sometimes when you sit down in

197
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,080
a sailing boat

198
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,919
it's a little bit awkward to sit down in

199
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
a sailing boat they're kind of weirdly

200
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,840
shaped so

201
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,680
it's not always the perfect place to

202
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,280
place your butt there's also a lot of

203
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,560
big objects

204
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,560
a lot of hard objects

205
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,840
that you could possibly fall on i was

206
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
gonna sit down

207
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,520
everything was fine it was a beautiful

208
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,479
sunny day we were all drinking

209
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
beer alcohol-free of course i was gonna

210
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,919
sit down

211
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,759
and i remember it so vividly i can

212
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,560
replay the whole scenario

213
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,080
in slow motion i was gonna sit down and

214
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,080
i was gonna grab my friend

215
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,680
while sitting down because like i said

216
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,280
it's awkward sitting down in a sailing

217
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,880
boat so i was gonna get help from my

218
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,479
friend to sit down

219
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,599
but this son of a gun moved away

220
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,120
in last second and i remember

221
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,120
so clearly just

222
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:32,160
falling out of my grass my hands knowing

223
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,479
oh god whatever my ass is gonna land on

224
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,000
it's not gonna be beautiful and let me

225
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,080
tell you it wasn't beautiful

226
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,039
i landed on a bench i don't know what

227
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,039
that's called in english

228
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,360
it's basically what you rail in the

229
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,319
sails with and it's pretty much as

230
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,160
uncomfortable

231
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,400
as you can imagine oh it's called winch

232
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,840
in english okay i screamed out

233
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:58,720
in terror in pain in shock

234
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,599
my ass ah my ass i was completely

235
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
immobilized

236
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,680
i couldn't move but most importantly i

237
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,840
was in deep

238
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,680
deep pain it really hurts to break your

239
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,319
ass i wasn't sure exactly what had

240
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,160
happened

241
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,319
but i knew something was wrong so me and

242
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,560
my friend as soon as we entered

243
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
we came to shore we came to harbor we

244
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,879
had to go to the hospital

245
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,599
we did the scan to confirm that yes

246
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,280
indeed

247
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,280
there was a crack in my ass

248
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,000
i didn't no longer just had one crack in

249
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
my ass i had two cracks in my ass and

250
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
that was

251
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,640
one crack too many to have let me tell

252
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,680
you i remember feeling very shocked

253
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,519
about this it was

254
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
a very traumatizing experience and

255
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,880
realization and i wasn't sure what they

256
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,599
were gonna do with me

257
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,080
how do you treat a cracked ass i thought

258
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,279
maybe

259
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,360
they would give me some sort of a

260
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,560
bandage kind of like a diaper or

261
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
something like that

262
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,760
and i remember asking the nurse what are

263
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,519
you gonna do and she's like well we

264
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,800
can't vanish your ass can we and i

265
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,399
thought yeah i guess you can

266
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,240
you live and you learn so instead they

267
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,560
just gave me a bunch of painkillers

268
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,480
and sent me off even though i had broken

269
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,320
eggs you know usually when you

270
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,920
break something i never actually broke

271
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,680
in anything in my body

272
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,519
so i was actually kind of looking

273
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,720
forward to it because everyone

274
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,640
you know when they're a kid they break

275
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,320
an arm they break a leg or whatever and

276
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,600
everyone's like oh it's so sad for you

277
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
and they get all this attention

278
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,440
they get people riding on your bandage

279
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,920
and no one's gonna ride on my

280
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
bandage ass bandage i realize all i have

281
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,680
to deal with

282
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,279
is the pain and suffering and most of

283
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,080
all the humiliation

284
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,279

287
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,519

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,480
