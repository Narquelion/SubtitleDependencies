16
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,500
annoying part is that no one knows

17
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,630
what's gonna happen if it was clear the

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,939

20
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,710
okay but now there's so much doubt and

21
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,520
confusion so I would wait a little bit
