llama draw from dammit what original

246
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,410
idea was to have like lava to drop I'm

247
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,870
super high so I built this giant power

248
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,360
of redstone and it took so long to like

249
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,640
get the redstone up there and then I

250
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,340
burned down half the house by accident

251
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,970
and I was just like God and then I

252
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,970

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,390

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,590
in opposite direction

304
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:53,350

resting lava I think you're supposed to

310
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,890
go like a hundred blocks north or south

311
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:12,400
and if you don't find one then go east

312
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:15,070
or west is that it's like the best way

313
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,800
of covering the most ground 100 blocks

314
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,400
