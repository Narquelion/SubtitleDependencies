150
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,250
man of common sense would rather be the

151
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,440
case just like anyone else wouldn't like

152
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:13,130
trees if they had common sense when fans

153
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,760
see Felix in public whoa feet where is

157
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,840
like water if they go in the water

158
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,040

159
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:34,310
start next me Wi-Fi drops down one bar

160
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,990
YouTube video quality yeah it's pretty

161
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,210
accurate oh god here we go again

162
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,030
pewds when he sees this make for the

163
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,890
million types so you know huh so you

164
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,140

165
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,900
glad I'm glad you deliberately want to

166
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:51,230
torture me you're so evil no wonder I

167
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,630
mean to you me sees there is another

168
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,610
meme ready to Scrolls later there is

169
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,860
another I saw one that was really funny

170
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,400
I sent to Jack with the potato one well

171
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,539
maybe it comes up later Frank an

172
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,490
ultimate two Frick

173
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:06,740
but it's less offensive but off

174
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,419
still satisfying using casual

175
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,400
conversation rather than genuine anger

176
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:17,360
it is less versatile than the real

177
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:19,340
f-word and is not used to refer what

178
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,840
that's un-freakin'-believable

179
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:27,520
I never seen such BS in my life whoever

180
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:33,289
wrote this you'll be sorry

181
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:36,770
cuz I'm gonna prick you ah ah ah that is

182
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:39,190
really cutting it to get to fraud come

183
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,190
on Danny

184

191
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:06,080

mark I appreciate you but the big brain

246
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,450
time makes no sense it puts it in the

247
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,160
wrong context you say big brain after

248
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,590
you've done something that's big brain

249
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,840
saying it's big brain time implies that

250
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:32,270
it hasn't occurred yet when you say it's

251
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,400
big brain time it's like I'm gonna do

252
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,620
something really dumb but if you say it

253
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,440
then it's not my brain it's not big

254
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,350
