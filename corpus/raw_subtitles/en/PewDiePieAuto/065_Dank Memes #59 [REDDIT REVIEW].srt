how how's it doing it oh it's just doing

52
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:30,190
that okay I thought it was holding the

53
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,560
legs of an ant to pretend to be an end

54
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,670

like the instrument rip off my shirt in

60
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,050

00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,000
can't be bad for everyone

65
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,500
why is everyone pretending like they're

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,690
the [ __ ] Joker like that's the

67
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,400
relatability is it because everyone on

68
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,550

69
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,450

70
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:18,880

73
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,340
thinking all right remember remember

74
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,140
what are you what do you don't remember

75
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,060
cuz you didn't experience this Zoomers

76
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,710
remember when he was actually frowned

77
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,230
upon to be a nerd okay

78
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:35,170
I remember because I lived through that

79
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,120
alright then shows like OC came out with

80
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,980
like Seth Cohen that guy being a nerd

81
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,750
and still kind of cool and quirky right

82
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,490
before then you had that you were

83
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,560
ashamed to admit you play video games

84
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,420
basically right and if you're listening

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,310
to this thinking no I'm never about to

86
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,580
ask if you didn't live through it okay I

87
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:54,790
paved that path for you you're welcome

88
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,760
okay years of suffering this whole Joker

89
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,370
appropriating of oh he's so he's so he's

90
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,330
so sad and still so epic you're welcome

91
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,280
okay

92
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,470
don't take that for granted you know how

93
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,560
in America you have all the oil thank

94
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,720
the troops here thank the Nerds okay

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,850
maybe I went a little far on that but

96
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,890
you it's just an analogy you understand

97
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,780
okay the reason why goals don't kill

98
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:20,100
people in real life is because they did

99
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,229
these people would become ghosts anymore

100
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,820

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:54,490
people under 21 smoke cigarettes letting

184
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,770
18 year olds take on a lifetime of debt

185
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,950
for an education

186
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:02,169
letting 18 year olds die overseas in a

187
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,820
war started before they were born

188
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,800
wait I thought they didn't let people

189
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,080
under 21 drink in America I'm so

190
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,789
confused then yeah a lot of a lot is

191
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,000
that the government does it's just

192
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:16,150
[ __ ] excuses to tax like in Sweden

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,580
we can buy alcohol when we're 18 but we

194
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,860
can't buy alcohol until we're 21 in

195
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,680
stores we just have to buy it from bars

196
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,320
and that makes so much sense that my

197
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,870
brain almost explodes from sense says

198
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,339

French nuclear pop where should we put

200
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,209

plants has to be Nexus to see or

202
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:41,709

because it's true that's awful awful

206
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,310

208
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:02,170

244
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:35,710

247
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:45,400
obesity humid what that jug star liquor

248
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,560
chubby chubby just for real though I see

249
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,220
so many people with overweight look at

250
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:54,190
this dog looking no Chuck no Chuck

251
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,350
everyone has a fat pug you never seen a

252
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,050
pug that isn't chubby chub now you ain't

253
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:03,100
good he don't invade me shave me shut up

254
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,510
shut up go back to Cape it is kind of

255
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,209
mean to over feed your pet is what I'm

256
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,810
getting at and I think pugs generally I

257
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,270
don't need

258
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,070
gonna rant about bugs actually never

259
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,330
mind it's this generally they're all fat

260
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,650
okay that's all I wanted to say but

261
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,090
they're not supposed to be fat just

262
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,410
because everyone's pug is fat and they

263
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,460
already have breathing problems so it's

264
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,460
not good for them that's all I'm saying

265
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,460
these ready videos are just me going on

266
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,320
random tangents about topics that

267
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,420
doesn't matter Apple's most expensive

268
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,620
Mac Pro can cost fifty two thousand

269
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:34,420
depending on 450 mm I'll sell you a much

270
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,880
better computer and it comes attached to

271
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,560
a car money that's crazy

272
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,450
why the [ __ ] would anyone spend that

273
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,910
much on that computer just cuz it's a

274
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,220
Mac it blows my mind I'm trying to

275
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,410
convert Marcia to Android but man it's

276
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:52,210
hard me playing Minecraft finding the

277
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:54,460
diamond for the 4000 uh finding diamond

278
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:57,310
for the 4000 time it's funny because

279
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:01,150
it's true only real minecrafter can

280
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:04,180
understand me checking my inventory in

281
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,890
the middle of a boss by people who think

282
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,020
baby oda should be meme of the decade

283
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,330
literally everyone else

284
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,890
how do people on Iran Nicola think this

285
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,690
how did they come to that conclusion I'm

286
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,790
so confused

287
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,160
imagine not being able to rotate your

288
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:22,720
plug this post was made by yo plug gang

289
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,640
damn actually I watched Tom Scott video

290
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,770
and he told me that the EU plug is

291
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,050
actually the most superior plug because

292
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,520
of its safety mechanism and other things

293
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,320
that I don't remember but I watched a

294
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,690
video and enjoyed it when you go to a

295
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,700
friend's house only to pet his dog I

296
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,830
gotta say though people that get too

297
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,600

302
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,650
dog because they don't have ya know feel

303
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,480
like I'm ripping on people that are

304
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,870

310
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,120
fittest more ideas like this please

311
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:14,560
[Laughter]

312
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,959
self-driving Mercedes will be programmed

313
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,310
to sacrifice pedestrians sacrifice

314
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,009
pedestrians you meat run them over

315
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,839
to save the driver mersen's gets around

316
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,430
the moral issues of self-driving cars by

317
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,509
deciding that of course drivers are more

318
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,920
important than anyone else

319
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:29,600
Mercedes somewhere you may die but

320
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,199
actual sacrifice time will they this is

321
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,209
exactly my video and the whole moral

322
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:37,490
testing I did a year a year ago moral

323
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:39,470
machine it's this website where you you

324
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,540
basically answer if a car should judge

325
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,550
for I don't know kill the old guy or

326
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,850
steer the driver and I'm like well if

327
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,069
I'm manufacturing a car I'm not gonna

328
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,170
sell a product that sacrifices the

329
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:52,790
driver so it made the whole video

330
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,949
completely pointless I'm like kill that

331
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,529
kill that kill that but it seems like

332
00:13:54,949 --> 00:14:00,350
Mercedes already figured out as much as

333
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:03,350
I'm a Tesla fan that by the guards that

334
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,790
make me respect Mercedes so much and at

335
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,529
least they have the balls to say it as

336
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,199
it is yeah I'm gonna kill the driver

337
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:10,910
he'd bought the car so happy I grew up

338
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,709
with this but damn this is better

339
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,059
nothing makes me feel like a Boomer than

340
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,220
trying to figure out how to add friends

341
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:20,360

they discover they are made out of meat

351
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:47,870
