just making videos I remember it so much

159
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:25,339
when you're fat a failure in school and

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,559

worst YouTube channel man your homes

165
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,629
assembled this is made like five years

166
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:42,409
ago when people used it and hate me oh

167
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:44,659
how things change oh wait nothing's

168
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:47,229
change we've gotten some requests by our

169
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:49,519
fans to have you on the off the pill

170
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,689
what are you saying you're down well

171
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,180
there's never been a more convincing

172
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,899
arguments of other people want you to be

173
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,819
on our show so I mean how could I refuse

174
00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:01,369
other people have told us this so

175
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,080
therefore I suppose we will ask Wow

176
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:05,990
really guys you want me on the show

177
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,379
why thank you so much I'm joking I would

178
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:12,129
like to be but a podcast is like a

179
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:12,129
double-edged sword

180
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:21,689
okay I committed to this analogy I guess

181
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:23,519
I don't want to do them and I'll

182
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:27,749
probably just get say something that

183
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:31,619
