41
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,269
dramatic but that's not who I am that's

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
not what this video is about it's just

43
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:20,970
this video makes me this video is just

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,700

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,230
the end you can get a refund at no

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,450

onion get a full refund also I can still

48
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,300
use it

49
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,290
it has asbestos in it but I can still

50
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,810
use it that's great

51
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,030

nice Thank You Jojo see what thank you

53
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,560
to be fair play devil's advocate maybe

54
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,470
this is one of those things where God

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,269
I'm trying to think maybe this is one of

56
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,280
those things where it sounds bad but it

57
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,260
really is not that big of a deal this is

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,150
the only way I can defend this I don't

59
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,820
know and I don't care to look into it

60
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,600
because I'm Mary ham and research that's

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,959
for [ __ ]

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,360
next news update update news update

63
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,910
nerves get excited for Update news team

64
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,620
few verses face cleanser on my update

65
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,890
yay I really want to know more about

66
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,579
this please tell us yes I will I will

67
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,130
okay calm down

68
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:13,260
Kieffer's lawyer has spoken out in an

69
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,930
interview previously what we know about

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,820
the faze clan vs t few lawsuit was the

71
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,650
fact that face client kept saying oh we

72
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,299
tried to just give him like an updated

73
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,500
coupon track but he just said no he

74
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,239
doesn't want to be part of face he just

75
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,769
like he doesn't want to be part of it he

76
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,560
said he's so unreasonable like why does

77
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,690
he not just negotiate with us well

78
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,370
apparently as it turns out through t

79
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,739
pers lawyers that they did they try to

80
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,489
give a legal version of the contract to

81
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,680
them which face client then adjusted so

82
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,660
much in the sense that it became illegal

83
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,910
again faithlyn was presented with the

84
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,160
contract turner would accept it was you

85
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,310
know as close to a legal contract and

86
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,020
you can get but parent

87
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,080
that wasn't good enough for them and

88
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,330
they decided to mark up about half of it

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,069
get rid of about half of it put in their

90
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,550
own provisions which again made it

91
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,319
illegal

92
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,650
once again obviously this is interesting

93
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,390
because it changes sort of what was the

94
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,069
dynamic as what was said but at the same

95
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,890
time what their version of the conduct

96
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,050
could have been easily as unreasonable

97
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,130
to face client as basic alliance

98
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,080
contract to tea whew

99
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,700
so it could be whatever yeah in the end

100
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,260
it could it doesn't even matter

101
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,489
another point that was interesting that

102
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,620
was brought up was there's sixty

103
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,419
thousand dollars that face Klein had

104
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,040
only taken from T few and that was it

105
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,570
that's all they taken but the lawyer

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,850
brings up well he's actually brought

107
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,790
them in so much more money just from

108
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,979
being in face thousand dollar figure as

109
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,740
to what they made off him it's

110
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,220
disingenuous I mean you realize how much

111
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,860
money

112
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,400
today's plan is making by having Turner

113
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,650
as part of its team how much advertising

114
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,530
they're selling how many sponsorships

115
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,930
that they obtain because Turner was part

116
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,810
of their team it's almost laughable to

117
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,150
think that they are saying that they

118
00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:00,050
took sixty thousand dollars from him and

119
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:03,050
that's it when they've made millions of

120
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,660
dollars okay alright it's a good point

121
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,550
right that's why phase wants to have t

122
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,820
feel part of face to begin with so that

123
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,580
they can make money um its clout his

124
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,680
epic fortnight cloud smash like if you

125
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,240
were like fortnight but then again if he

126
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,680
makes him that much money through brand

127
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,229
deals then why the hell did he only make

128
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:27,110
sixty thousand from it right or what's

129
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:31,460
20% I mean math help me sixty times X X

130
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:35,630
times X times zero twenty three hundred

131
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,039
thousand that's my mad TV's only made

132
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:43,250
three hundred thousand for through brand

133
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:45,830
deals from face coin alright next dodgy

134
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,979
veggie versus ksi drama that this has

135
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:52,820
been some of the hot this drama in a

136
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:55,370
very long time like no no one cares

137
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,610
about this even me try to figure it out

138
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,370
I'm like okay

139
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,319
all right well then G upload a video

140
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:12,569
yesterday or two days ago it's very

141
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:14,639
emotional okay so how did we end up here

142
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,800
well let me summarize for you instead of

143
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,740
watching one like five hours of content

144
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,050
three weeks ago today G K sighs brother

145
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,000
uploaded a video saying that he's tired

146
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,729
of seeing as the bad guy and he uploaded

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,099
this video called by and he's like my

148
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,689
brother is not that great okay the main

149
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:32,550
gist of the video was that he felt like

150
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:34,710
his brother didn't sign up for him his

151
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,509
brother didn't have his back and that

152
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,590
he's done a lot of shady stuff as well

153
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:43,710
have you back no matter what family

154
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,750
sticks by you then ksi responded to this

155
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,599
videos here for you whether we're on

156
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,509
good times or bad terms whenever you

message me I always replied edge I want

158
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:57,090
you to succeed in everything you do but

159
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:58,889
Dad you man you have to communicate with

160
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,919
me to me this video seemed pretty

161
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:04,289
genuine he addressed all my I think all

162
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,629
the issues that desi brought up about

163
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,639
the girl drama that happened apparently

164
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:10,199
Capeside slept with a girl that did he

165
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,599
liked some drama that happened during

166
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,150
Christmas who [ __ ] cares that day G

167
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,650
is always getting punched in his videos

168
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,750
or something like that and they do

169
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,629
respond to saying okay moving on great

170
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,000
great thank God just solve this

171
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:26,250
privately like why was this video made

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,289
to begin with I would be a lot more

173
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,419
inclined to pick the G side in this

174
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:31,949
situation if this original video didn't

175
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,620
have a bunch of minerals on it it's a

176
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:36,960
45-minute video very much in the same

177
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,939
style as the Tati call out James Charles

178
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,310
video that was gaining so much traction

179
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,750
if it wasn't for these two things I

180
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,509
would be more inclined to believe the

181
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,969
AG's intention with just wanted to stand

182
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:50,069
up for himself he keeps saying that I'm

183
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:51,779
not attacking case I am just standing up

184
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,029
for myself that my intention was not to

185
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,379
attack him but you are bringing up a lot

186
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,449
of things about your brother

187
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,699
to make him look bad you don't have to

188
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:02,370
do that to defend yourself not all of it

189
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,080
is that way but a lot of it is you can

190
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,240
stab someone and say I'm not trying to

191
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,670
hurt you well that doesn't change the

192
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,550
fact then deggi uploads a fourth video

193
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,990
wearing the exact same outfit what have

194
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:18,530
you been tuned for the past two weeks

195
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:21,330
Tajiks you're surprised edgy oh my god

196
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,800
in this video daddy says that a yes huge

197
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,750
evidence saying that caves I lied about

198
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,580
the girl thing because the case I said

199
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,100
can yes I said he didn't know who the

200
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,290
girl he slept board was actually someone

201
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,380
his brother knew oh my god he straight

202
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,660
up I'm gonna show you some huge evidence

203
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,040
that will just make you question the

204
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,230
whole of my brother's video I didn't

205
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,330
even know she knew you I don't even

206
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,670
remember your name even being mentioned

207
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,190
for all I knew she was just a girl that

208
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:55,320
I met at a concert I didn't even see her

209
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:58,920
in any of your videos so this is case I

210
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,630
saying that he knew the girl was on his

211
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,150
channel but that doesn't prove that he

212
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:06,090
knew that they were together but then

213
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,100
again ksi look at this I have evidence

214
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,620
never remember your name even being

215
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,630
mentioned ball I news he touch his nose

216
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,540
that's like a classic example of lying

217
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,460
ksi liar confirmed this happened what

218
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,830

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,920

right she did she have a cold

241
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,650
I didn't know she had a cold I wish she

242
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,510
had called the next day and I thought

243
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:28,280
she gave me an STD I was pissed

244
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:33,750
that's why I said all the Miche I said

245
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:37,650
oh my god I got a cold I thought you had

246
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:40,310
an STD then it gets very emotional and

247
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,310
very intense

248
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,980
despite daddy's flaws I do like him in a

249
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,140
way he's he has over here you have some

250
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,760
likeable qualities okay I hate to see

251
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,020
him like this I think this has clearly

252
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,810
gone too far Deji

253
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,490
please take a break you'll be fine it's

254
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,790
time to take a break from YouTube this

255
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:11,250
is it's not a good idea in one way you

256
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,380
know he's the one that made the first

257
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,130
video he's the one that started all this

258
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,590
out of nowhere

259
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,770
and it shows again how bad of an idea is

260
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,390
to bring these private matters into the

261
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,490
public eye a lot of people seem to think

262
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,680
like oh yeah people just do all this

263
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,840
crazy stuff to start drama online and

264
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,790
like it's gonna be epic they get so much

265
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,950
views yes they get views from it but

266
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,350
clearly it's taken a massive mental toll

267
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:37,410
on Deji and I do feel them for that and

268
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,810
I think I hope he realizes to just stop

269
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,630
this no one cares who's right and wrong

270
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,520
at this point I don't just it's time to

271
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,650
drop it I will not be talking about this

272
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,690
anymore this is just stupid at this

273
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,070
point I think it shows a it's a fatal

274
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,630
flaw with the YouTube book pal

275
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,160
you know numbers start dropping and you

276
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,650
feel like you have to do something and

277
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:59,790
then at the end was it worth it I don't

278
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:02,130
think so next news doctor disrespect did

279
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,780
something disrespectful what

280
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,000
unbelievable

281
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,400
so doctor disrespect did an IRL stream

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,080
on they eat through floor he was very

283
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,280
much in character making fun of people

284
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,419
at the site

285
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,419
[Music]

286
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,019
then doctor disrespect did the

287
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,649
unthinkable

288
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:39,899
he had very hot poopoo and needed to go

289
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:43,160
and make mud pies diarrhea honey can we

290
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,160
find the diarrhea place

291
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:56,430
and he filmed inside the bathroom so

292
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,430
here's how that footage looked like

293
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:06,829
by

294
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:16,370
ladies a jump I gotta take a diarrhea

295
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,370
grab that

296
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,509
[Music]

297
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,490
this cause doctor disrespect of getting

298
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,860
banned from twitch that's right

299
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,140
everybody so it is against the Community

300
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,180
Guidelines I think on twitch website it

301
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,740
says that sharing content that violates

302
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,290
another reasonable expectation of

303
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,910
privacy from for example streaming from

304
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,890
a private space without permission

305
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,340
should this doctor disrespect been

306
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:53,890
banned yes I don't think anyone is

307
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,430
arguing against he clearly went against

308
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,670
the rules

309
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,230
I and that's just how it is I've seen a

310
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,120
lot of people's picking some sort of

311
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,760
moral high-ground of going I can't

312
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,890
believe I can't believe doctor

313
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,100
disrespect did this obviously I

314
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:11,800
understand that's people want bathrooms

315
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,560
to be a private space and that that

316
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,320
should not be violated I'd get it at the

317
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,680
same time I don't see the baby it's sort

318
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,910
of like the mean with boys locker room

319
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,920
what do people think happened in the

320
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,140
boys locker what if someone saw

321
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,410
someone's penis I have never seen a

322
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:32,290
penis in a boys locker room or a men's

323
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,030
bathroom okay unless you specifically go

324
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,590
slow and you're not gonna receive some

325
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,420
peanut peepee a lot of people have been

326
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,830
saying well there was a kid there was a

327
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,130
kid in one of the urinals

328
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,290
oh well checkmate liberals kids aren't

329
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:47,350
allowed at e3 maybe you should try and

330
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,660
ban him instead huh oh it's illegal to

331
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,730
film in a bathroom okay all right but

332
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,470
let's look at the law number of six four

333
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,760
and seven which everyone brings up this

334
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,560
is the one everyone talks it's illegal

335
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,050
it's illegal okay well what does it say

336
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,430
privacy exists basic existing law

337
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,870
generally makes a person who looks

338
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:09,310
through a hole or opening into a

339
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:12,130
periscope telescope camcorder camera in

340
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:15,130
a bedroom bathroom changing room pin

341
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,100
room blah blah blah blah blah blah with

342
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:21,130
the intent to invade privacy of a person

343
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,590
is guilty of misdemeanor with the intent

344
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,870
was it doctor disrespect intent to

345
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,630
invade the privacy of a person in there

346
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,100
I think that's arguable maybe I'm not a

347
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,470
lawyer so I have no idea what I'm

348
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,080
talking about from this footage of this

349
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,270
it's just following him into the

350
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,250
bathroom stall it's not trying to show

351
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,850
other people this is what I got about

352
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,009
out of it was it a bad idea I was

353
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,290
Lee should he have gotten banned I guess

354
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,670
so that are those are the rules

355
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,500
was this the worst thing that has ever

356
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,269
happened I don't think so

357
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,800
that is not for me to say I think other

358
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:54,690
people should do this I'm just looking

359
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,970
at the context of this I don't see it as

360
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,930
that big of a deal to act so outraged

361
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,399
about okay

362
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,050
it seems more like people are insecure

363
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,240
about their schlongs being shown on

364
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,000
