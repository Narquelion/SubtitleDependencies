00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
hello i wanted to talk seriously and

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,000
honestly for a moment

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,920
about my thoughts on what's been going

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,840
on for the past couple months

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,960
and hopefully you you can get a better

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,040
understanding of

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,880
my perspective i think it's time to end

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,000
the subscribe to pewdiepie movement or

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,720
me

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,480
it's something that started off as a way

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,760
to keep me as the number one

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,880
most subscribed channel on youtube and

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,679
seeing so many people come to my support

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,200
other creators as well has been

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,600
incredibly humbling to me

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
it's really really meant a lot it's

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,040
something i never thought i would

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,800
experience and it's something i thought

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,879
would last also for maybe

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,079
just a couple of days or maybe a week

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,160
but here we are

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,760
it's been six to seven months now and

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,480
it's been a crazy journey

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,719
at first it started off with people

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,680
doing really positive and fun things to

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,600
get attention

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,039
through subscribe to pewdiepie but

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,039
something i learned and

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,559
i think hopefully it's something people

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,800
can understand is when you have

31
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,559
90 million people riled up about

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,519
something you're bound to get a few

33
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,840
degenerates

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
and it started off with someone spray

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
painting

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,799
sub to pewdiepie on a world war ii

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,720
memorial and just so disgusting

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
so disappointing to have my name and

39
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,200
community uh

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,640
dragged into that i addressed it on

41
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,880
twitter i disavowed it

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
we saw that it got removed and and

43
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,479
donated to the park

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,880
hoped that that was gonna be it i didn't

45
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,960
want hateful acts to

46
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,400
overpower all these amazing things that

47
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,439
people were doing all these cool and

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,640
positive things

49
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,960
but then something happened that i don't

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,840
think

51
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
anyone would have predicted the

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,280
christchurch

53
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,200
shooter said subscribe to pewdiepie out

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,000
of the the respect for

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,079
the families and victims involved i

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,479
chose not to address it any further than

57
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,240
on twitter where i disavowed the actions

58
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,360
taken that day and i

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,840
gave my sincerest condolences to

60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,719
everyone affected to have my name

61
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
associated

62
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,119
with something so unspeakably vile has

63
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,520
affected me in more ways than i let

64
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,319
shown i just didn't want to address it

65
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,239
right away

66
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,360
and i didn't want to give the terrorist

67
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,120
any more attention

68
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,200
i didn't want to make it about me

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,360
because i i don't think it has anything

70
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
to do with me to put it plainly i didn't

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,520
want hate to win

72
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,000
but it's clear to me now the sub

73
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
subscribe

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
to pewdiepie movement should have ended

75
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,640
then lastly my feelings around the

76
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,800
subscribe to pewdiepie thing would not

77
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,920
be complete without mentioning t-series

78
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,640
uh i made two diss tracks that were made

79
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720
in fun

80
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
ironic jess they were not meant to be

81
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,440
taken seriously

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,120
and now high court in india demands that

83
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,519
they're gonna be blocked

84
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,599
and removed this was all made to be fun

85
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,000
but it's clearly not fun anymore

86
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,599
it's clearly gone too far and out of

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
respect for that i'm gonna

88
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,840
keep the videos blocked on a similar

89
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
note some people in some media

90
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,519
has made this sub to pewdiepie thing

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,440
about

92
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,000
race or about politics or nationality

93
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,200
and i don't agree with that at all and i

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,120
want that to stop

95
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,120
this negative rhetoric is something i

96
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
don't agree with at all and i want that

97
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,920
to stop and to make it perfectly clear

98
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,560
no i'm not racist i don't support any

99
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,280
form of

100
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,159
racist comments or hate towards anyone

101
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
finally

102
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,440
i don't want hitting 100 million

103
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,400
subscribers to be about

104
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,159
beating another channel i think what

105
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
we've accomplished is so much more than

106
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,239
that

107
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,080
and i just want to say i feel incredibly

108
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,360
lucky to have such an amazing group of

109
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
people supporting me

110
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,560
i think i can say that because i know

111
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,319
them better than anyone i

112
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,799
ironically i'm so proud of this

113
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,920
community and this movement started out

114
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,680
of love and support

115
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,200
so let's end it with that i hope that

116
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,840
you understand my perspective

117
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,680
and i ask you kindly to accept it thank

118
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,959
you for listening

119
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,959
that's all bye
