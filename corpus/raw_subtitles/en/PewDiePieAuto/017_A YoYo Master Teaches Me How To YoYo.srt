after many years of searching and long

59
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,750

went off and pursued the truth of life

74
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,070

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,070

the watch yes the diner lane your your

120
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,230
tricks notice that each trick has its

121
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,910
own color that's so that when you want

122
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,180
to refer to a particular trick for

123
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,530
review just fast forward your VCR until

124
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,930

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,740
release yo-yo in the sleeper position

129
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,760
spinning at the bottom of the string at

130
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,340
a high rate of speed

131
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,690
now the yo-yo master has his hand up in

132
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,760
the air the arm you don't have to do it

133
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,340
like that you can if you want but it's

134
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,230

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,210
a trick that's not a trick

139
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:23,190
thirty-year-old man yo-yo should have

140
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,690
invested in yo-yo stocks before this I

141
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,390
remember when I was a kid

142
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,220
yo-yo was a fad in school it was really

143
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:35,870

152
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,780
from the other tricks in that the

153
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:25,900
releases to the side and across the body

154
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:33,520

171
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,500
for thinks of us as the yo-yo in the

172
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,000
palm of the hand and as we live life we

173
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,260
go out into the world spinning around

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,880
and around seeing new places and making

175
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,530
yo-yo and philosophy to things I would

yo man gets more requests for oh my god

217
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:58,670
yes I already know this one we call this

the clock like the pendulum do you know

219
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,960
this is how literally I got Marzia I'm

220
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:05,770
not even joking this first thing I did

221
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,190
when I landed in Italy I was like girl

222
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,140
what's good

223
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,060
I actually catfished her but then I

224
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:18,350
showed that yo yo all right listen

225
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:20,920
loop-de-loop whoa holy moly slowly no

226
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,920
that's impossible

227
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:43,430
the timing yes yes oh yeah

228
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:50,540
wrist and finger action that's what I'm

229
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:53,360
all about okay okay okay not good it's

230
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,030

did a good bit terrible I just realized

235
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:14,630
I got to do it straight how do I do it

236
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:16,350
straight okay that was once okay okay I

237
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:22,590
see it

238
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:28,770
ah damn it I'm sweating oh that was

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:33,060
clean dude I'm gonna get so much gamer

240
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:35,490
respect after this Jesus I could have

241
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,380
died I nearly could have died but it

242
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:40,130
would have been worth it I'm not scared

243
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,830
of the yo yo yo yo you're scared of me

244
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,390
yo you're scared of what I'll do to him

245
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,590
okay that was too loop-de-loops that was

246
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,570
three loop-de-loops

247
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,120
wrist and finger movement come on Felix

248
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:55,470
wrist and finger movement wrist and

249
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:59,100
finger movement yeah wrist and finger

250
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:09,930
movement oh oh oh I got the trick I

251
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:12,300
understand that was amazing dude once

252
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,250
you get it you get it once you got it

253
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,500
you got it I'm ready for the yo-yo

254
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,970
Championships you have to understand

255
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,430
that I'm also being watched that makes

256
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,990
me a little nervous you know if I wasn't

257
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:28,710
filming I could do all of these tricks

258
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:31,380
on the first time it was good flying

259
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,540
saucer what is that not only is the

260
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,150
flying saucer fun to watch but it also

261
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,940
adjusts the twist or the tension of the

262
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,950
yo-yo string see the yo-yo comes out

263
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,350
takes an angle in the sleeper position

264
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,970
continues until it's fly absolutely flat

265
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,280
and then you bring it back to the hand

266
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,500
now the reason it does this is unlike

267
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,450
the other tricks the yo-yo release is

268
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,340
not straight down it's to the side see

269
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,770
that yo yo man just plug it to the side

270
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,390
about what that's so cool boom back to

271
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,100
the palm of the hand now let's see how

272
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:02,680
we do this trick you take your

273
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,940
to the side seat right from the start

274
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,889
45-degree angle

275
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,930
now watch in a sleeper position the

276
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:09,339
yo-yo is cocked a little bit see it now

277
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,050
it's even continuing till it's

278
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,970
absolutely that's impossible that's

279
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,440
physically impossible in the strings

280
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,930
where you say we get up four to six

281
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,420
inches above the yo-yo that's insane

282
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:23,829
physics don't make sense anymore I'm

283
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:27,459
serious I can't even make it spin at

284
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:36,399
that angle oh my god I did okay so it is

285
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:47,110
possible oh oh no your man can do it

286
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:50,050
this okay I understand I'm fine

287
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,540
didn't even hurt have you seen that meme

288
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,790
where the guy shows off his pokemons on

289
00:15:52,540 --> 00:16:01,060
Thanksgiving to his parents that feels

290
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:03,490
like what this is oh holy moly smoly

291
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,740
I did it almost this reminds me of a

292
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,680
time of one there you know when

293
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,019
everything wasn't discovered already you

294
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,560
can just do a bunch of cool [ __ ] you

295
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:14,709
know what I mean

296
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,199
oh wow this messed up the thread

297
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:19,360
completely oh god it's all ruined

298
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,399
do you know what I mean I understand the

299
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,579
mix of philosophy and yo-yo now it's all

300
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,990
coming together it's like my skating was

301
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,430
inventing it was like this new thing and

302
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,500
people are trying to test the limits of

303
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,970
what kind of thing you can do with it

304
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,130
yo-yo is in Venice

305
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,310

00:16:50,880 --> 00:17:05,750
too strong did he ask for gold silver or

313
00:16:53,100 --> 00:17:07,800
other material goods because

314
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,280
materialistic items will never make you

shows that we don't need complex video

319
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,620
games with fancy graphics and smash 6

320
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:26,550
we don't need movies with epic cinema

321
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:30,620
CGI we just need simple yo-yo to be

322
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,620
happy happy

perfect score it's safe to say it's the
