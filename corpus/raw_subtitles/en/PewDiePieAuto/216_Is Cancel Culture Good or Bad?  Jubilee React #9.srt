things sorry I forgot today we're doing

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,450
a video on you belays should we cancel

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,879
celebrities for their crimes where they

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,829
discuss about canceled culture they'll

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,239
gather people in a room some are for

13
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,250
canceled culture other people are

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,289
against it let's say what they have to

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,780
say and I hope I can give some insight

16
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,719
as well as a YouTube egg big person

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,489
let's go our Kelly bye I'm done with you

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,620
get out of here like but that's in your

19
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,930
opinion I'm not saying I'm here for our

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,800
our Kelly I just think if you support

21
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,390
him your dick right yeah and then there

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,280
you go everyone everyone hates our Kelly

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,010
no matter what sight on the spectrum

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,350
you're on we can all agree our Kelly is

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,930
done this should be a fruitful

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,760
conversation it's so funny because on

27
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,530
the internet everyone loves to be so

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,960
divided we have it's basically like

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,909
everyone is driving into cars so it's

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,130
okay to yell at each other but you get

31
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,960
people that don't agree on the topic in

32
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,030
the same room and all the sudden I think

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,710
this is a natural human trait that we we

34
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,960
are naturally agreeable it's kind of

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,270
funny I just threw that in there for no

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,189
reason it's just an observation that has

37
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,790
nothing to do with the point okay let's

38
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,970
keep watching

39
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,460
yeah I guess

40
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,790
guess who there cancel culture people

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,790
are

42
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,540
be a liability Eilish stand over here

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,690
doesn't like our Kelly hello my name is

44
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,550
a deep Kadir he's amped about science to

45
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,760
City and I'm a product manager in the

46
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:03,520
tech industry hi I'm will Kourt I'm a

47
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,130
music student at USC hi I'm joy Villa

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,680
I'm a singer-songwriter and I am anti

49
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:14,190
cancel culture like I she said that I'm

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:17,200
actually anti mm-hm they got a nice

51
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,720
diverse group I was saying and I should

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,860
be interesting ish cancel culture more

53
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,950
on this I'd been looking forward to this

54
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,720
conversation hi I'm Seth Fowler Law

55
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,490
School graduate there's a hot take I'm

56
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,290
against cancel culture but everyone

57
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,560
everyone that is for canceled culture

58
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,410
needs to be canceled they need a taste

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,760
on their own medicine we'll get into it

60
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,360
I have so much to say about this we'll

61
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,630
get into it

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,310
I would buy an artist work even if they

63
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:46,930
committed a violent crime mm-hmm I would

64
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,480
be inclined to say no because obviously

65
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,670
I don't want to support anyone that does

66
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,560
violent crimes but on the second hand

67
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,450
it's very circumstantial what if they're

68
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,490
defending themselves then I think is

69
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,930
fair game but then on the other hand I

70
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,440
probably supported a lot of rappers that

71
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,270
done for violent crimes

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,270
it's like rappers are not part of a big

73
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,220
group let's get real here it's teenage

74
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,290
girls in charge of any cancer culture

75
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,989
movement feel free to tell me if I'm

76
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,000
wrong there's a reason trap hasn't been

77
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:18,010
cancelled yet let's get real here humans

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,160
are a series of impulses on a spectrum

79
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,230
of time like we are constantly changing

80
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,239
we're constantly evolving I have any of

81
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,130
you have honestly never not told a lie

82
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,830
in your life of course we evolved us so

83
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,060
are you a liar today boom what an

84
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,160
argument that's a great point actually

85
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,290
that new ones has never put today you

86
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,880
can tell clearly with people digging up

87
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,740
old videos and using that

88
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,070
as evidence if we want to do castle

89
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,900
culture I feel like we need like a

90
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,520
certain time we need to get more

91
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,170
organized as what I'm saying certain

92
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,150
time frame I guess that's the thing like

93
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,580
you know a Shane is someone getting

94
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,740
cancer right now and you know you watch

95
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,690
it clips and you're like jeez but it

96
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,550
doesn't say when they're made or and

97
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,400
stuff like that same with Jenna you know

98
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,500
you watching her like but then knowing

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,870
oh that was actually 9 or 10 years ago

100
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,370
that to me at least I'd changes things

101
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,100
online and especially if I know that

102
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,680
person has grown out of that that

103
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,990
doesn't make it okay what they did but

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,520
at the same time I don't see a pretty

105
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,410
reason dragging someone to the dark

106
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,330
because of it I'm trying to argue both

107
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,060
sides here like I think it's good that

108
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,430
there's a clear line of what's okay

109
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,530
today by maybe referencing things in the

110
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,790
past but I also don't think there's a

111
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:33,060
good reason to cancel something for what

112
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,660
they did in my mind's eye I don't know I

113
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,920
don't say anything

114
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,470
yeah damn it I haven't thought about

115
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,720
this properly I think the issue with

116
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,010
canceled culture is it's kind of like

117
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
this like you have a cut on your arm

118
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,330
let's just chop the whole arm off yeah

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,790
it's also I like this guy's got good

120
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,060
points I like that very good good

121
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,370
metaphors it's true he's not wrong he's

122
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,140
not wrong he's right the amount of

123
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,730
people that work on some of these

124
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,140
projects like think of like a Harvey

125
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,670
Weinstein movie right he did terrible

126
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,620
things I wouldn't want to port support

127
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,420
Harvey Weinstein but most of his victims

128
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,650
are people that were in his movies by

129
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,790
not supporting the Harvey Weinstein

130
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,610
movie are also not supporting his

131
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:14,080
victims so it's kind of like you're in a

132
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:16,240
weird spot it sounds like a weird

133
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,930
argument but I actually agree with him

134
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,940
because for me example I mean oh [ __ ]

135
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,960
honestly Harvey Weinstein movies a

136
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,790
hundred percent

137
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,770
there will be more movies they will be

138
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,390
okay but at the same time looking at

139
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,280
from my perspective with the scare

140
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,470
PewDiePie getting cancelled I feel

141
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,480
terrible about every one that worked and

142
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,030
I hundreds of people that never got to

143
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,190
show all this all the guests that we

144
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,220
have all that so many people on the set

145
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,230
planning organizing money all this stuff

146
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,150
that never got to show anything for it

147
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,970
because of me and that doesn't feel fair

148
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,210
to them and I'm sorry like honesty is

149
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,490
point but with hard

150
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,110
one scene that you can't bring down the

151
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,840
kingpin without bringing down the

152
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,190
organization that he built I guess

153
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,720
that's the problem now everyone is a

154
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,500
kingpin apparently you got a YouTube

155
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,520
channel it's like people are massively

156
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,310
overestimating our influence when it's

157
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,789
convenient and massively undermining it

158
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,990
when they feel like it

159
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:14,990
ahem he's just irrelevant

160
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:19,819
can you believe he posted this for his

161
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,560
hundred of millions of subscribers many

162
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:23,030
times I hear that whenever it's

163
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,130
convenient the argument switches it's

164
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,110
great so he said something very

165
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,080
interesting to me about like the whole

166
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:33,259
cutting off the arm and to fix a cut and

167
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,810
I feel like the exact opposite because

168
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:40,250
when you talk about how like you get

169
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:42,380
another arm is that what you meant oh if

170
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,930
you're canceling people bond they have

171
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,449
good inventions it's like there's so

172
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,830
many smart people there are so many

173
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,319
smart people that's where you're wrong

174
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,870
that's why I can't cancel culture exists

175
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,500
there's too many dumb people that's the

176
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,090
problem oh my god remember last year

177
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,310
when James Charles was cancelled and the

178
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,169
entire world was so sure that he was a

179
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,659
creditor and the amount of people that

180
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:08,750
spread that message around causing him

181
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:11,360
to almost end up being suicidal did we

182
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,550
learn anything from that no no one

183
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,590
learned anything absolutely nothing if

184
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,690
anything is his worst now did we learn

185
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,659
maybe we shouldn't point fingers before

186
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:24,199
we know the full truth no no that does

187
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:26,449
not happen anymore those days are over

188
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,080
powers in our hands and I feel like for

189
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:31,580
me I'm doing my part by not choosing not

190
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,259
to like mess with that person anymore

191
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,719
look how conveniently they're putting

192
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:38,810
this what a hat facts argument right

193
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:40,159
that is not cancel culture saying that

194
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,960
you don't want to listen to someone who

195
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,550
[ __ ] cares no one's gonna stop you

196
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,680
the problem is that canceled culture

197
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,229
wants them to stop making whatever that

198
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,990
is they're making they want the the

199
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,639
platform or all these things that's the

200
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,580
point of cancer culture saying that oh

201
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,270
I'm just like I don't want to listen to

202
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,020
them anymore

203
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,310
no that is not how it works your music

204
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,190
should be continued to be sold and

205
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,050
available

206
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,030
personally don't think so just don't

207
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,130
listen to don't buy you yourself yeah

208
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,230
absolutely every individual has the

209
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,210
right to say hey I don't like this and

210
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,980
you can even tweet about saying no but

211
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,630
then to start a boycott that's what yeah

212
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,250
people are different morally I

213
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,350
personally have the right I withhold the

214
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,760
right I think all of us do to not go and

215
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,770
support these people we don't believe in

216
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,560
I would never tell you wait I'm gonna go

217
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,960
see XYZ movie and you have to - if you

218
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,300
say no you have that right what cancel

219
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,500
culture does is saying I'm not gonna see

220
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,620
this person because I don't like this

221
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,590
person is buddy I'll shoot that's why I

222
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,830
hate it and smart people I like them

223
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:42,450
like a militant so culture is out of

224
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,430
control what the hell is that

225
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,830
when was this film when it started a

226
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,680
2090 was a good thing it's like the me -

227
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,660
movement a good thing I agree you know

228
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,300
you had all these victims the police

229
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,480
didn't listen what else are you gonna do

230
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,610
now that now it's like wait you say you

231
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,750
were this and that why didn't you go to

232
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,360
the police oh they're not gonna listen

233
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:07,290
anyway you should still go to the police

234
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,390
if it's just easier I was right

235
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,790
something when you get the court of

236
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,820
public opinion involved I tell you it

237
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,130
becomes so horrible I am an artist I've

238
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:24,420
legitimately hit number one on Billboard

239
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:27,570
people think oh I wish you throw that in

240
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,580
there this is like I don't run my social

241
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,920
media I absolutely do I read comments I

242
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,680
respond even negative ones when people

243
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,870
say I hope you die somebody should kill

244
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,060
your family you should get raped so that

245
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,910
you you have a baby illegitimate you can

246
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:46,800
I mean it is online bullying cancel

247
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:49,200
culture rationally is overall a net

248
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,560
positive I think but there are sects of

249
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,630
cancel culture like the toxic people

250
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,820
that issue the death threats then of

251
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,250
course those need to be excised cancel

252
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,020
culture originated out of compassion the

253
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,150
voice for I guess that's the problem no

254
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,160
one holds the people the people that are

255
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,290
part of the hate mob accountable you

256
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,790
know I think I think the James Charlie

257
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,650
Singh is such a good example because

258
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,360
everyone wants so on board with

259
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,910
canceling games and

260
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,470
now people are definitely defending

261
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,060
James to the point where they go after

262
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,070
other people for whatever reason I'm

263
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,050
just saying that is the thing that

264
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,269
happened but wait a minute you were

265
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,589
first you were ready to cancel him you

266
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,140
don't get the right to switch around you

267
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:30,600
know if an influencer did that in turn

268
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,850
they would be held accountable but for

269
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,160
the amass group of people that that just

270
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,940
doesn't exist so it's like they're

271
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,140
expecting everyone else to be better but

272
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,420
everyone part of castle culture are no

273
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,670
better than self I think so at least

274
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,010
and speaking of which taught the upload

275
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,079
of the video and I wanted to address it

276
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,600
so badly because I hate her so much

277
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,930
but I'm just so done with all of this

278
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,910
it's so childish it feels pity to even

279
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,040
comment about like YouTube drama and all

280
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,440
this council stuff that's going on I'm

281
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,779
just like I don't want to participate in

282
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,940
this this is just ridiculous and I don't

283
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,800
even care who's right at this point it's

284
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,980
like let's say you wanted to boycott

285
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,990
coca-cola or Nike or something imagine

286
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,540
if stores started taking Nike shoes out

287
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,459
of the store before you could even make

288
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,680
the decision as a people to buy it or

289
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:22,980
not buy it and we need to have the right

290
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,589
and in the option that our love is I

291
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,769
mean technically I'm sure if something

292
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:31,320
really bad came out about a big brand

293
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:34,470
they probably wouldn't shelf it right

294
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,810
because it looks bad on them so that the

295
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,850
argument isn't really bulletproof I'm

296
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,579
just playing devil's advocate here for

297
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,610
the sake of it and also it's almost like

298
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:46,620
YouTube is still so new and people have

299
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,500
been doing it for so long when the

300
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,750
internet was basically the Wild West and

301
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,240
people said and did whatever they did

302
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,740
wanted and that's kind of when it's part

303
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,750
of the charm of YouTube people could

304
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,910
express themselves completely freely but

305
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,220
now with more advertising and more

306
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,740
people watching it's clearly slowly

307
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,199
developed into a mainstream

308
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,500
something more on the ground sub

309
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:12,149
corporate sort of cleanness and that

310
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,220
seems to just be the standard for now on

311
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,410
you know II from someone that's been

312
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,230
through all this cancer time I've

313
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,920
definitely become so much more aware of

314
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:25,079
not just what I say but how what I say

315
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,939
can be perceived because it's not just

316
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,970
what you meant

317
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:30,979
by communicating something it's it's if

318
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,659
you can take a portion or what you said

319
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:34,549
and it seems like something else that's

320
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:36,799
enough so that's how careful you gotta

321
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:38,119
be when you articulate yourself and yeah

322
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,739
a lot of times it's not even worth it

323
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:42,109
that's why I don't like doing piu news

324
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:44,959
anymore because it's just too much to

325
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:47,029
keep up with and I just and and then I

326
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,269
don't I felt done with drama and Papa

327
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,799
Gloria died as well which is so sad

328
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,209
I know people some people who think oh

329
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:55,249
that's so sad he doesn't do it anymore

330
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:57,379
and he it's not right but I also feel

331
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:59,269
like I'm too old man

332
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:01,189
I don't care this is not why I started

333
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:02,959
YouTube and I mean no way expressing

334
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:05,389
myself here so let's keep watching sorry

335
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,189
for all the rainbows trying to make you

336
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:10,249
not buy the product I think that they're

337
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:11,629
saying as a company we do not agree with

338
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:14,509
this so we're not gonna sell your

339
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:16,849
product here when record labels stop

340
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:19,489
playing their music or whatever I feel

341
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:22,249
like it's justified specifically for

342
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:23,569
victims because when it gets out that

343
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:25,669
that person did something like that

344
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:28,099
their music skyrockets and for the

345
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:31,249
victim seeing that they're getting so

346
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:33,199
much and then once your cases are over

347
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:35,329
sure you can play their music more if

348
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:37,999
they are innocent but it's also like the

349
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:41,509
justice system isn't always right I

350
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:44,949
gotta say people have a very childish

351
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:48,649
sense of justice it's almost like at a

352
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:50,720
childlike level it's probably just me I

353
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:53,539
don't think most people would agree on

354
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,849
this to me if someone did me bad I

355
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:58,639
wouldn't feel justice just because other

356
00:13:55,849 --> 00:14:00,229
people found out other people need to

357
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,059
know this person is bad because

358
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:03,829
otherwise it's not fair to me I think

359
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:05,209
that a lot of people think that way and

360
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:05,629
it's a very childish way of looking at

361
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,149
things

362
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:10,189
oh this person treated me badly I'm not

363
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:11,919
trying to downplay one no there's

364
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:14,419
obviously many bad things happening and

365
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,159
there's also things that seem come out

366
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:18,679
and seem very trivial you know again

367
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:21,649
referencing that as an example so people

368
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,509
don't take what I say out of context the

369
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:26,239
toffee and James situation where Tati

370
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:29,239
was mad Lizzy tobert was mad that her

371
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:31,279
friend promoted a brand that wasn't hers

372
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:34,009
and that was all it took to create the

373
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,079
biggest cancel drama in the history of

374
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:38,209
YouTube that's basically the mindset of

375
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,300
this person did something bad to me now

376
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,800
I need to do so

377
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,080
bad for them and other people need to

378
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,330
know about it that's what I mean this is

379
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,550
we're clear just to be clear don't

380
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,500
cancel me uh if I have a problem with

381
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,209
someone i other stop talking to them or

382
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,160
I work it out in private but that

383
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:55,829
apparently does not exist because

384
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,010
everyone on this website is a mental Lea

385
00:14:55,829 --> 00:15:02,130
develop underdeveloped child the public

386
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:05,130
should hold celebrities accountable when

387
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,570
the justice system fails have people not

388
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:10,529
being taught that the world isn't there

389
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:12,329
and is never going to be that doesn't

390
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:16,410
mean you should try obviously but it's

391
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:18,810
like it seems so basic I don't get it

392
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:24,450
I clearly don't get it this is my take

393
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:29,610
on it our Kelly is the first name that

394
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:32,940
comes to mind because he has sex tapes

395
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,290
that show his face and people are still

396
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,180
like didn't do it

397
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,130
we love our Kelly he would never and

398
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,310
most of the time when it's a celebrity

399
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,970
being convicted they can always buy

400
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,800
their way out

401
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,839
that's exactly they came to mind for me

402
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,120
too what does she mean buying her weight

403
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,790
their way out not getting good lawyers

404
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,959
yeah I can see that actually that's what

405
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:58,200
happened with I've seen them isn't it

406
00:15:51,959 --> 00:16:00,360
it's a fair point how many times in like

407
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,459
the United States justice system have we

408
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,890
seen guilty people get off innocent and

409
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:07,200
they find off years later that that

410
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,690
happened if such a lot of times it does

411
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,279
happen and I think especially it happens

412
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:16,709
when you are basing decision around

413
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,779
anger and this important sense of

414
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:21,300
justice now it needs to happen now

415
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,579
instead of in a court of law where it's

416
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,829
carefully examined and impartially

417
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,959
examined I think that's important

418
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:31,050
justice system doesn't come through we

419
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,399
as a people shouldn't that yeah again no

420
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,079
one's waiting for the justice anymore

421
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,420
everyone just found a shortcut that's

422
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,800
the problem what's important and what's

423
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,420
happening now is that we do look at

424
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,130
replacing whether it's the district

425
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,870
attorney or whatever the system is

426
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,490
that's causing it to fail people should

427
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,990
go and address this so the next millions

428
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,610
of people that go through that system go

429
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,870
through a justice this room I think we

430
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,550
all completely agree with that like the

431
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,550
justice system needs to be fixed but I

432
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,740
do think there

433
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,779
reason canceled culture started and when

434
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,720
it originally derived was because like

435
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:01,420
to be 100 like that takes so long like

436
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,399
for our entire government and justice

437
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,380
system to like evolve until you're

438
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,970
idealistic view of it is not happening

439
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,439
next year we're I think we're making

440
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,839
change I think it's happening but I

441
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,370
think our generation that spawned

442
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,170
canceled culture was like you don't have

443
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:17,260
time we have the same problems with kids

444
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:19,480
it doesn't matter how it started what

445
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,100
the problem is what it is now which is

446
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,530
ironically the problem with canceled

447
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,569
culture because they don't seem to draw

448
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,790
any distinction on the past and present

449
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,569
apparently I just think if you support

450
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:37,210
him you're a dick

451
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:39,429
right yeah I hate how they're bringing

452
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,130
up our Kelly yeah everyone can agree on

453
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:44,040
that but the problem is so much more

454
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,210
nuanced than name but I like

455
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,040
compassionate canceller culture if you

456
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,460
look at the history of somebody and you

457
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,350
look at how somebody responds when

458
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,420
confronted they're not discussing any of

459
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,220
the nuances they're just speaking very

460
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,350
broadly you know it's so easy to take

461
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,330
clip or a portion of someone said or

462
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,580
literally just spread rumors online

463
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,380
that's enough for people who jump on

464
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,419
board and cancel someone these are the

465
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,860
issues to me I I think it seems like

466
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,050
everyone agrees there should be

467
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,460
something happening to bad people yeah

468
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,740
we can all agree on that there should be

469
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,929
some repre caution but it they're not

470
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,750
discussing any of the issues that a

471
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:23,140
moles within it we all kind of have the

472
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:25,929
same opinion on a level we think that

473
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:33,730
people deserve console myself yes but I

474
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:36,880
feel like we oh my god

475
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,380
good talk yeah I appreciate a civil

476
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,670
conversation but Jesus Christ that was

477
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,910
at least productive thing I've ever seen

478
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,910
in my life

479
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,400
let's see what the comment has to say

480
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,260
cuz I'm curious it depends yep cancel

481
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,240
culture isn't activism it's virtuous

482
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,250
signaling on social media to get clock

483
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,350
points on the internet cancel culture

484
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,360
works in a way to where people are guilt

485
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,700
to improve until proven otherwise which

486
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,280
is a large reason why it's so toxic

487
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,840
[ __ ] sake is this aimed at James

488
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,760
Charles well yeah I think it must have

489
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,250
been uploaded at the same time it's such

490
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:14,010
a perfect example but no one learned a

491
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:16,630
single thing and it blows my mind dude

492
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:19,150
the same people that are like we need to

493
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:22,480
cancel James Charles can you believe

494
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:24,549
James Charlesworth suicide on we should

495
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,590
have canceled culture cards and pass

496
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:28,299
them out you get one alright yet one

497
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,549
everyone gets one and then you have to

498
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:32,020
shut the [ __ ] up that's my solution I

499
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,299
think people just have to be brave

500
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,580
enough to stand up you know I know I

501
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,799
referenced James Charles scenario

502
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,390
million times already but when I looked

503
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,740
at that I couldn't make sense of why

504
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,480
everyone was canceling James over

505
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,669
something so trivial and something

506
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,600
allegations that were not proven at that

507
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:51,090
point I think I'm probably more prone to

508
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,620
look at things more openly since I've

509
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,540
technically been cancelled as well and I

510
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,330
hope the public will catch on it seems

511
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,250
like in general most people in these

512
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,650
comments seems to be against it but the

513
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,540
problem is when you get a big group very

514
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,910
worked up no one wants to come in

515
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,390
between and say no because then they'll

516
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:11,620
jump on you and that's just how it is

517
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:14,020
everyone loves canceled culture until

518
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,000
you're the one being canceled curious

519
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,290
about your thoughts on this leave some

520
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600
comments down below maybe we can have a

521
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,639
discussion

522
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:26,159
thank you for watching I'm gonna take

523
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:28,889
two days off and see ya tomorrow no two

524
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,049
days thanks to all the members I've been

525
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:33,090
really happy that we can do support

526
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:35,909
different charities month thanks to all

527
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:38,429
the members and I'm happy to be able to

528
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:40,440
do something positive in these times

529
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,500
that internet just seems so incredibly

530
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,110
heavy when I said as well as the final

531
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,659
point whether that I'm careful with what

532
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,639
I say now because an effective council

533
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:52,200
culture it's not that I'm you know I'm

534
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:54,269
not even scared of being canceled it's

535
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,480
more the fact that I I just want to

536
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:59,879
enjoy YouTube like if people came after

537
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,490
me for dumb reasons I know how to defend

538
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:06,149
myself the problem is most people aren't

539
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:08,129
equipped with the tools to deal with the

540
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:09,570
giant hate mob and that's what leads

541
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:12,629
people to cancel themselves you know

542
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:15,090
people like Jenna Jenna Bob was to quit

543
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:17,220
YouTube recently because of the clips

544
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,230
she did always eight nine eight ten

545
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,649
years ago because she's just fed up with

546
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,360
it which is completely reasonable

547
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:26,879
completely understandable but I hope she

548
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,370
comes back IIIi think people don't

549
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:32,070
realize this sort of what kind of ball

550
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,629
of pain they're inflicting on an

551
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,789
individual by doing these things because

552
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:37,409
you might think over just getting them

553
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:39,720
canceled or we're just getting them to

554
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:41,610
monetize or whatever but it's so much

555
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,429
more of an item and whenever there's a

556
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,080
big hate mom going at someone you might

557
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,269
you might not see it but there are

558
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,909
people doing extreme things like sending

559
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:53,549
death threats Daxing go into addresses

560
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:55,559
calling parents calling jobs doing all

561
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:57,629
these things that maybe you don't even

562
00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:00,149
think about if you think we're just

563
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:02,220
doing this you deserves it there's so

564
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:04,679
much more to it that isn't it just isn't

565
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,690
right and it's not appropriate that was

566
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,700
my final thought for some reason I felt

567
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,700
like I hadn't talked enough okay

568
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,980
[Music]

569
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,090
it's time to race what was once

570
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:24,340
forgotten

571
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:31,830
what creatures fought spells and poop

572
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:31,830
troops awaits hoopty is coming to

573
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:44,580
Nintendo's wait and remember it has a

574
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:44,580
very big TV pre-order promotion I mean a

575
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:52,430
