the

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,480
elgato hd pro it's the thing you used to

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,520
record uh

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,800
game console capture with i had it

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,360
forever

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,600
and i just was so scared because it was

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,440
like oh you have to install it into your

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,280
computer

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,039
what can you hear me by the way

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
that'd be [ __ ] awkward if i have to

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,559
tell this story this is funny because

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,559
like you literally just

20
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,760
i was so scared because the idea of

21
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,159
putting something

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
by myself and my computer was so was so

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,080
much more difficult

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,840
in my head than it was in real life it

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,400
so when i did it it was like

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,439
changing the head of a vacuum cleaner

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,799
like it was so easy and i felt so stupid

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,640
for putting it off usually

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,880
computer related stuff is always more

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,880
difficult than you think it is

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,840
but this time it was the opposite so i

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,840
was like what the [ __ ]

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,920
this is funny now i can play on my

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,119

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,840

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,479

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
it's like oh this is a hidden thing we

75
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,800
shouldn't share it

76
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,800
but i still want my members to see it

77
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840

87
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,840

without hearing anything

92
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,880

meditation

100
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,440

yeah i know i know

107
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
certain type of drugs can help you reach

108
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,680
some sort of

109
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,120
ego association which makes you it

110
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:15,440
changes you as a person but i'd rather

111
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,440
if i wanted to reach some sort of

112
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
conclusion about myself and my ego i

113
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,720
want to reach that on my own and not

114
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,720
help through drugs because

115
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,879
i want to be able to return to that

116
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,639
place on my own

117
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:41,839
if i ever get there not

118
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:41,839
relying on drugs to get there

119
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,399
go sit under a freezing waterfall until

120
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,200
you realize well i guess that's

121
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,320
what i'm gonna have to do isn't it i

122
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,200
wouldn't mind

123
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,440
it's a journey there isn't it i'll get

124
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,440
there

125
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,680
uh i want to upgrade some stuff real

126
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,399
quick

127
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,120
how's the is it is the game play too

128
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,120
loud or too low

129
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,640
oh no

130
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,560
i like when you really practice your

131
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,160
mindfulness you can sometimes feel your

132
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,120
blood moving through your body i know

133
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,120
what you mean actually

134
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,120
that's a good idea i was a good minute i

135
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,160
didn't practice i'm

136
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,760
trying to really feel your body because

137
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:46,480
it takes you out of your mind to do that

138
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,480
uh do i want to upgrade this no

i think i'm really close

142
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,240
yeah we're almost maxed it out so i

143
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
might as well go for that first

144
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,399
all right let's do a main quest because

145
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,839
everyone wanted it last time

146
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,600
maybe i shouldn't do many questions

147
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,680
since no one's really watching right now

148
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,720
what do you guys reckon it feels a bit

149
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,399
like

150
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,120
because people really want to see them i

151
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,120
might as well wait

152
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
am i going to play ballarant again

153
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,000
honestly valerian seem pretty

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,519
things give you a glimpses into another

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,360
side of your consciousness

158
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,240
sounds like you are a proponent of drugs

159
00:10:47,360 --> 00:11:01,839
my dude no shame

160
00:10:50,240 --> 00:11:01,839
do what you want to do i don't care

161
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:15,839

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,839
isn't that crazy

165
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,360
it takes into a state of mind that when

166
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,600
you try to recreate

167
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:45,600
that sober assume it's not the same

168
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
well yeah that's drugs for you

this is like far cry japan yeah

181
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,000
i think with most drugs your body

182
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
becomes desensitized to the enhancement

183
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,720
to your constitution but mindfulness to

184
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,519
the effects

185
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,680
become more by now yeah i mean i guess

186
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,839
another word of mindfulness in this

187
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,040

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,040
i'm very much against it but i'm also

189
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,720
open to the idea that i

190
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,200
have never tried it so i can't really

191
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,760
judge it but i i just know it's not

200
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,890

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,839
foreign

203
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,839
nicotine is a drug

204
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
is

205
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,879
blue

206
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,879
[Music]

207
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839

i like the song is playing it's popping

209
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,400
there's hardly anyone in this stream i

210
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,400
don't don't understand why

211
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,080

it is very chill though so i'll take it

214
00:17:45,919 --> 00:18:00,320
it's a lot easier to stream and there's

215
00:17:47,760 --> 00:18:02,720
only a couple people

216
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,600
guess we got to climb this mountain [ __ ]

217
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,600
yeah i'm into it

218
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,400
which mountain though i can't even see

219
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,400
it it's so semrina

220
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,039
oh [ __ ]

221
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,480
so oh i see so you have to it's an

222
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,039
element of gameplay

223
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,039
i don't realize

224
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:42,880
if you can [ __ ] off mr dog because i

225
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:46,080
clearly need to hurry the [ __ ] up

226
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
oh it's taking damage now

227
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,360
oh my god it's right there

228
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,080
here we go

229
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,600
that's kind of fun

230
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,880
unexpected but yeah

231
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,840
i wish i could sit in the game

232
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
like dark souls style

233
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,880

234
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
glad you asked

235
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,720
because you see the gameplay is here so

236
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,200
it makes sense

237
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,600
that i'm like looking at the gameplay

238
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,120
nice attention to detail

239
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,080
do you understand let's see how my hair

240
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:39,840
looks like a [ __ ]

241
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,840
ball thank you

242
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,080

pretty quick

245
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,320
otherwise we are toast or the opposite

246
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,320
of toast i should say

247
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:08,000

248
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,640

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,840
oh i see it i see it

254
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,960
when i learned that word the first time

255
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:47,039
i always thought it was samus

256
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,039
it helps oh you're dead

257
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,520

267
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,159
i haven't seen game of thrones or read

268
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,840
it

269
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:45,840
but i understood the reference that's

270
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
epic

271
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:59,840
i can sit a little bit i guess

272
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,840
i can sit a little bit

273
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,000
i don't really have time for dogs

274
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,799
[ __ ] i was hoping there would be a

275
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,880
grappling hook place there and i just

276
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:41,840
went for it

277
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:41,840
guess not zero deaths cringe

278
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,840
well this is going great

279
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,640
it said it's so hard to see

280
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,840
i don't know where to go

281
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,760
maybe i'm supposed to go up on the side

282
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,760
here

283
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,960

that was beautiful we're almost there

293
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,480
cool quest

294
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,080
i'm not sure why the stream is not

295
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,080
alerting everyone

296
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,799
but uh it's a very chill chill group of

297
00:24:47,120 --> 00:25:00,240
people

298
00:24:48,799 --> 00:25:01,679
i think we're less than a hundred

299
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,120
this looks a lot easier than the other

300
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,799
ones because i keep getting lost

301
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,720
otherwise

302
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,720

303
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,440

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,159
yeah there it is

307
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,200
oh this is a close call dude

308
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,480
we made it

309
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
squishy

310
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,559
nice

311
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,559
nice

312
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,440
is our cool picture to be taken here

313
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:25,840
this is what it really looks like

314
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:39,840
if anything i just want like

315
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,400
i want like uh

316
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:56,159
this with the audio and uh

317
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,840
that's cool an animation like a

318
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,520
recording of it and then have that

319
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:07,840
animated like a

320
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:07,840
maybe use wallpaper engine or something

321
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:26,159
that'd be [ __ ] cool

322
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,159
that looks cool too much

323
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,840
too much looks good on its own

324
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,840
let me actually try and get a better

325
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
pose

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:17,840
oh i love how you can see the ocean

327
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,399
really struggling here

328
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,840
i feel like this would look better

329
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,840
without me

330
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,440
there we go that's what i wanted

332
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:27,840
yeah it feels like a loading screen

333
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:27,840
isn't it

334
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:55,840

places in pharah

454
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,440
locations a friend of mine told me about

455
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,200
a ramen place that's like

456
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,760
built on top of a mountain so you have

457
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,760
to walk all the way just to get it

458
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,319
it's like at the most obscure spot ever

459
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,319
but it's still

460
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,560
popular

461
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,359
i'm sure the ramen isn't that good but

462
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,160
it's like the journey to get there

463
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,480
all right we're gonna fight this guy why

464
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160

469
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,800
he said find a rock

470
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:06,319
i guess i wasn't paying attention this

471
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:21,119
is awkward

472
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:24,800

473
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,720

475
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:35,839
the bear

476
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:49,839
in before frostbite

477
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,520

478
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,839
well that's a little harder

479
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:20,000
this is going to be tough i don't have

480
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,000
any resolve in this battle

481
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:31,839
all right

[Music]

485
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
is

486
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,400
i didn't see the prompt i was so focused

487
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,880
on the combat i did not see the text in

488
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,880
front of me

489
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,839
[ __ ]

490
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,209
[Music]

491
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,920
you fight with no honor

492
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,599
you didn't study the blade deeply

493
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,599
oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] that's cheating

494
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:26,960
[Music]

495
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,920
he's letting me fight him that would

496
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,920
have been a lot easier

497
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,839
come on

498
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:02,160

charges

502
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,119
that's really useful

503
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,800
i kind of want to check out this guy's

504
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,040
dojo a little bit

505
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,839

506
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,839
know i'm saying

507
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,720
i love the the duels i wish they made a

508
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,079
whole game around it

509
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,079
it's like the most fun part

510
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,319
right and then have multiplayer aspect

511
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,520
to it kind of like for

512
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,839
honor if they made a second one skip all

513
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,359
the

514
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,359
cut scenes and [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ]

515
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,680

516
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,359
multiplayer options kind of like

517
00:45:45,680 --> 00:46:01,839
bloodborne

518
00:45:47,359 --> 00:46:01,839
that'd be so [ __ ] cool

519
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:14,480
that would that that went well this is

520
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,760
the back end

521
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,760
hopefully there's a cool little

522
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:29,839
view from point i expect it a bit more

523
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:57,839
oh i like the red in the sky

524
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:25,839
and every skype

525
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,240

526
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,280
i really like when you can't see

527
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,839

purity of war new mask huh

538
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,200
the fire of war is fury cannot be

539
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:05,760
contained

540
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,359
uh we got ourself a new mask check it

541
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,200
out

542
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,200
i do quite like the one we have

543
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,040
haunted dreams worn by those who have

544
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,079
seen

545
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,880
death that's pretty [ __ ] badass

546
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,880
kinda want that

547
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:45,839
is that the one

548
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:45,839
mask is really cool too

549
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:59,839
nasty that's cool

550
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:59,839
that looks cool

551
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:13,599
there it is it doesn't match it's just

552
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:16,880
kind of ugly

553
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,880
i think i like that one

554
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:27,839
which one is more aesthetic because

555
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:27,839
that's really what i give a [ __ ] about

556
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,960
i think this is the most aesthetic one

557
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,559
it doesn't look good in this light

558
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,559
though [ __ ]

559
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,400
the pain of being a man

560
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,200
they all look terrible in this light

561
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,200
what the [ __ ]

562
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,680
can someone change the light please it's

563
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,839
almost like the game lets you alright

564
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,839

569
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:52,400
that's the one let's go with that i

570
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,640
don't [ __ ] care anymore

571
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,359
we can upgrade our sword that's what we

572
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,359
can do right now

573
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:08,000
get the n95 mask [ __ ]

574
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,000
i didn't think of that

575
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,960
also i remember pete saying i didn't buy

576
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,880
the digital

577
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,640
deluxe version of this game what would i

578
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,800
do with it

579
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,240
okay yeah now i regret it maybe

580
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,680
it just i don't know they're just trying

581
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,400
to squeeze extra money out of you i'm

582
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,559
not down with actually

583
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,559
boom

584
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:35,280
boom

585
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,520
pewds growing as a channel yeah thank

586
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,520
you

587
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:44,480
we upgraded everything yes

588
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:47,839
yes where's the the boyers over there

589
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,839
where's the armor

590
00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:01,280
any gifts i shall accept guardians

591
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,640
scowl for someone aiming to disassociate

592
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,319
from

593
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,160
physical pleasures and striving for

594
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,760
minimus valley why are you building a

595
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,280
clothing brain

596
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:15,839
uh good question

597
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,839
it's step by step process i would say

598
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:32,240
it's also fun

599
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,680
i feel like if i cut i like i know what

600
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,359
i need to do to get there

601
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:43,839
but if i i know if i do it all at once

602
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:43,839
it's not a good idea

603
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,359
and it's also harder when some some

604
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:54,240
stuff are tied into your business

605
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:56,960
so it's like bigger decisions to make

606
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,920
but yeah i think i think especially not

607
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,920
tsuki per se

608
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:04,640
because we're more environmental

609
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,160
uh conscious but like the merchant that

610
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,440
i sell

611
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,880
is obviously not good for the

612
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,839
environment and i do feel kind of

613
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,839
strange about that

614
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:19,680
where is the armor like it

615
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,480
it is fast fashion and um i'm

616
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:26,240
technically against it

617
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,440
there's also problems because if i don't

618
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,800
sell it people will be like where is it

619
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,119
where is it i would not hear the end of

620
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,359
it

621
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,400
and i i don't know i guess there has to

622
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,000
be a way and

623
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,000
the problem is actually if i sell merch

624
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,040
for a higher price because that's what

625
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,200
it would cost

626
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,640
to produce like more i got on a

627
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,240
different tangent here that's not what

628
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:46,079
you asked but

629
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,079
um people would complain

630
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:53,839
because the prices wouldn't be higher oh

631
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,839
yeah step by step

632
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,839
i want to upgrade the ghost armor

633
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,960
what the [ __ ] are you doing get out of

634
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:20,319
my shot i'm trying to look at myself

635
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:23,520
are there any cool arm uh

636
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,520
like clothing options

637
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,319
i can't see anything

638
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,839

639
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,200
