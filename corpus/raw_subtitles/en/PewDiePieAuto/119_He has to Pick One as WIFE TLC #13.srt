00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,520
don't have much

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,160
too much of a personality either

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,599
why would a hot young guy travel across

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,680
the ocean to be with an overnight

61
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
divorcee with two kids in iowa

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,040
you got to have a couple months with

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,040
that some tunisian arm candy and he got

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,800
to come to the states transaction over

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,480
stop chasing after him like

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,000
he broke your heart or something damn

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,840
if he was truly here for the right

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,680
reasons to begin with he wasn't here

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,040
just for a green card

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,319
then it would still be a little bit of

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,400
compassion yeah and there's not

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,080
so why are you chasing after him if he's

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,720
completely compassionate i have the

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,959
courtesy of saying i'm leaving

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
he just walked up the door i really want

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,959
to know what the hell did i do to make

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,360

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,599
letting him walk

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,040
on you i don't think anybody's gonna

81
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,040
fault the fact that

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,720

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,680
didn't want to acknowledge the red flags

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,680
because you love the man

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519

the way that she's treating me it's like

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,120
not a husband she's treating me like

149
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,720

like daniel i gave i mean

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,000

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,880
another woman

191
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,240
partying it up muhammad always claimed

192
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,199
he was just friends with

193
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,360
louisa but i believe that there's

194
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,440
something more going on with them

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,360
she is a detective holy sh

196
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,720
oh my god it finally hit me danielle

197
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,280
looks like peter griffin

198
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
bruh come on guys he literally stuck

199
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,160
around for two to three years with a

200
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,360
lazy horrible woman

201
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,840
he aren't that beast it's so weird to

202
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,319
see who

203
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,840
the comments are siding with danielle is

204
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,800
so incredibly possessive

205
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,680
i mean it is it was his her husband i

206
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,879
can

207
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,560
to some extent understand but i just

208
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,680
don't know the full context as well i

209
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,240
don't think that looks like

210
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,759
friends he's still married and how's

211
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,919
that gonna look he knows that his

212
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,440
immigration his visa is on the line

213
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,599
since he knows that you figured out that

214
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,319
he scammed you

215
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,240
i think in the beginning he did love me

216
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,720
but then he started getting attention

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,080
from

218
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,280
prettier better looking women

219
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,360
that had more money i think he changed

220
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,560
all right some self-reflection here some

221
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,160
character development

222
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,680
that mohamed had sex with louisa

223
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,680
why would you ask that i'm still

224
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,919
yeah definitely here what the [ __ ] do

225
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,810
you think well let me make it very clear

226
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,980
he's a [ __ ]

227
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,980
[Applause]

228
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,429
let me make it clear did not expect her

229
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,919
to say that in that tone

230
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:46,160
[Applause]

231
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,560
how did she do that well let me make it

232
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,519
very clear he's a [ __ ]

233
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,120
i mean i don't know how else to say it

234
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,519
let me make it clear

235
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,240
i just think that when she has to say it

236
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
out loud

237
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,240
it makes it more real for her and that

238
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,320
makes it much more he's a man [ __ ]

239
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
and let me make it clear what a friend

240
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,040
muhammad doesn't do

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,040
anything that's not going to benefit

242
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,200
muhammad muhammad doesn't care

243
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,279
who he hurts to get there who he steps

244
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,519
on what lie he has to tell

245
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,959
or where he has to stick his penis he'll

246
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,360
do what he has to do to get what he

247
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,560
wants

248
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,200
stop you can stop him why why would you

249
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,760
do that

250
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,000
just break up with him i know a marriage

251
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,680
is a sacred thing but if you entered it

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,279
on these circumstances then i don't

253
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,399
think it was that important to begin

254
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,800
with danielle

255
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
all right jesus christ dude let it

256
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,040
[ __ ] go

257
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,480
god damn it but it's my husband yeah

258
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,000

private

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,200
instead of taking care of that problem

333
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,720
she was like fighting with me over it

334
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,079
no man in the world can accept that and

336
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,600

337
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:21,200

oh my god

357
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,680
you know i thought he would have some

358
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,279
subtlety because he said it's very

359
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,240
private it seemed like he wasn't gonna

360
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,600
say anything

361
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
and then he got to a point where she's

362
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,760
even saying i don't want to hear it

363
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,000
anymore

364
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,430
well it's so sad i can't believe it to

365
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,760
get him deported

369
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
oh if you want him deported i don't

370
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,480

372
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,800

385
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,480
he can't treat someone like this and

387
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,120

i'm in miami he disappeared i've been

389
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,000
trying to track him down for a while

390
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,000
and i finally found him he's gonna have

391
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,199
a visitor soon and i'm finally gonna get

392
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,279
some payback

393
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,959
oh god they're all crazy it's a

394
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,600
beautiful thing i love it

395
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,959
and i am damn sure he had sex after we

396
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,839
got married did you want to know the

397
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,680
last time i had sex with my husband

398
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,600
three months after we got married do you

399
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,839
think every guy in this world has sex

400
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,839
with his wife every freaking day

401
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,360
i highly doubt it to happen every day

402
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,600
well from the

403
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,279
from the way is that muhammad's friend

404
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
sounds like it so where is he getting

405
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,720
sex from

406
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
nobody needs to know your sex life

407
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,839
either but you're freaking

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,440
talking about that because you think

409
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,399
muhammad's all innocent

410
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
he's getting sex from someone he's

411
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,959
getting

412
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
it from somewhere else if he's not

413
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,839
having it with his wife

414
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
not necessarily

415
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,560
new england newlyweds are always

416
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,399
touching each other filling each other

417
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,240
making love with each other because

418
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,279

never thought i would like tom more than

449
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,360
elderly dead legend

450
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,160
now that he knows how bad my financial

451
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,160
problems are i'm afraid he'll want to

452
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,680
leave to go back to tunisia

453
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,560
oh so wait what now you're worried that

454
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,480
he's gonna wanna

455
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,720
i thought you wanted to deport him

456
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,720
basically a sugar mama with no sugar

457
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:50,320
jesus you need to explain me everything

458
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,680
so i can anderson are they back together

459
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,120
well you didn't tell me that you have

460
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,839
problems before i come here

461
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,000
or is this during before he left why

462
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,600
because i was scared that you would

463
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,279
you wouldn't want me to go outside i

464
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,439
thought you wouldn't want me

465
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,400
you knew the truth dude it's mean you're

466
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,079
you're lying

467
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,160
it's not about scared or not scared

468
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,280
oh so this is what happened during

469
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,199
everything there

470
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,400
why was this posted so much later family

471
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,400
my friends everything

472
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,600
are we gonna be able to figure all this

473
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,079
out before your visa

474
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,720
yeah like even if i even if i moved to

475
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,079
someone

476
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,600
and they had money and they turned out

477
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,520
to have they'll not have money or

478
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,960
whatever i'm just saying hypothetically

479
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,720
right if i find out they don't have

480
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,400
money that's not as bad as i find out

481
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
that they lied about it right

482
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,320
that's the issue here and it seems like

483
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,760
that's what muhammad thinks

484
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,840
that we're not god she sounds such a

485
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,840
fake cried isn't she i'm worried

486
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,320
you have to change a lot of things but

487
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,559
i'm afraid

488
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,799
yeah if we don't figure this out that

489
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,880
you're gonna leave

490
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,000
so now we know his actions were

491
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,360
justified problems

492
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,320
i will never leave because of the

493
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,400
problems or cause we don't have money

494
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,840
i will live only if you keep doing

495
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,360
things by yourself

496
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:17,120
and don't share it with people

497
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,559
because i have some bad news yeah this

498
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,960
