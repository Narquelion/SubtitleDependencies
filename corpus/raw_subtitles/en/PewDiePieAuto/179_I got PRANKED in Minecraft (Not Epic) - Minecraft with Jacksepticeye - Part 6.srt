to turn into a gaming millennium it

312
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,420
would be read in history books and this

313
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:00,519
is how a gaming week became gaming

314
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,500
millennia this is how the PewDiePie

315
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:09,939

his dad was very different at this time

320
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:20,620
of his life so he probably had some

321
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:22,480
impact we don't know yet what full

322
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,040
extent the influence it's not so much

323
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,649
about what he was saying it's about what

tried to move a fox bad things happened

643
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:07,139
because the leash is like to break if

644
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:08,009
you try and get foxes upstairs or

645
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:09,809
anything with a li show upstairs

646
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:10,799
sometimes it just keeps bouncing and

647
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:11,820
then you take the leash off and it

648
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,799

should we started putting a top on it or

663
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:54,830
you want it to stay flat on top or these

664
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,809
are the top and right questions always

665
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,190
have the hardest answer that's the power

666
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:59,780
of the pyramid just depends on how much

667
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,460
time we want to do the kids well we

668
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,909

00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:12,740
was just small too big we should build

673
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:15,740
it like that one prism angel in Neon

674
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,150
Genesis yes you know I'm saying I have
