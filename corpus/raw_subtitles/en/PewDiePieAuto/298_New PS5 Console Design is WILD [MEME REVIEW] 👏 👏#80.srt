sincerely the entire gaming community I

40
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:26,110
want to wear it as a hang that actually

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,180
looks real you see what I mean about the

42
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,550
old depictions of the future do you

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,920
understand

44
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,660
Jojo called it as always I knew it I

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,600
understand this because I watched the

46
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:42,430
anime and I am a fan of the anime big

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:45,460
announcement you see what I mean

48
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,830
what were they thinking I actually like

49
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:51,670
this iteration though what instead of an

50
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:55,710
AC or a fan or something I have a Wii I

51
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,000
have a doubt their place they should buy

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,650
maybe it looks better in person I don't

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,510
want to be that guy you know that just

54
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,280
sort of things but before I even saw

55
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,130
anyone's reaction to it I'm like that

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,790
looks really ugly I'm not gonna lie what

57
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:14,950
I am PlayStation 5 no an idiot's and we

58
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,400

mean

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:24,220
point proven again I would wear that as

61
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:26,020
a hat I guess the thing is people you

62
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,940
have to take in consideration is the

63
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,370
value Sony's always been on on the

64
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,170
frontier of cool designs with all their

65
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,459
consoles it might say had a good

66
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,320
suggestion where they they should have

67
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,239
done a new version of the first

68
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,800

69
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,959
been kind of cool I would rather have

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,060

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,070
when Sony releases places in 5 but

97
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,930
that's what cause what is the prize of

98
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,919
the Sony Playstation it hasn't been

99
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:55,970

joke console community freaking out

107
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:13,910
because the new PlayStation 5 would cost

108
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:17,450
plus $500 PC users who spend that amount

109
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:20,560
just for a graphics card what I get

110
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,120
believe it's so expensive I'm on red

111
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,729

113
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:31,310
though that's all I want to know Sony

114
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,120
I'll expect a comment very soon so the

115
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,520
starting price for the PlayStation 5

116
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,780
whoops we ran out of time guys didn't

117
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,510
they announce when they announced the

118
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,400
PlayStation 4 the prices is amazing and

119
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,690
they were so proud of it there was no

120
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,550
way that we're not gonna have a part of

121
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,169
that in their presentation so the fact

122
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,700
that they haven't announced the price is

123
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:55,849
not good news but again what we're all

124
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,099
wondering will it have Skyrim what's the

125
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:59,960
point otherwise come on Todd give her

126
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:02,060
Skype give us just give a Skyrim we

127
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,760
don't just get it over with

128
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:12,979
how old is Skyrim what was that release

129
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:16,320
this new games existence oh god damn it

130
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:20,670
what was gta5 early

131
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:24,370
2013 why do we hear about this still

132
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:26,170
well well well how the turntables yeah I

133
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,940
can't believe Xbox came out on top with

134
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,910
the help whenever there's ever so

135
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,850
vicious evil troll stirring mean stirs

136
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,220
make fun of a company product you know

137
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:39,190
someone somewhere it's writing an

138
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,680
article no this is not okay

139
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,510
it doesn't matter guys it doesn't matter

140
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,460
what the PlayStation 5 looks like I

141
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,350
agree with this I definitely don't care

142
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,260
what I put in my living room in front of

143
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,300
everyone I definitely do not care at all

144
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,100
that's probably why they spent millions

145
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,930
and millions on the design because they

146
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,850
it doesn't matter what the design looks

147
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,740
like that's probably why you're right I

148
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,560
am convinced it looks like an air

149
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,870
purifier yeah you know it's not a good

150
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,130
design when literally the mock-ups

151
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,380
looked better

152
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,210
I remember seeing like yeah does this

153
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,420
not look better I would much rather have

154
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,340

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,660
can you imagine of all the things we

230
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,060
probably try to milk as a species and

231
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,010
then finding out it doesn't milk that

232
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,260
sounds like a mr. B's video does it melt

233
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,330
or something I spend 10 grand to milk

234
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,100
see what I can milk you know what I mean

235
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,370

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,490
an argument against X pass notes halo

240
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,520
have you played halo I played all of

241
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,950
them on every single console I feel like

242
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,630
this might be the time for Xbox to

243
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,880
finally catch up on PlayStation I

244
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,040
obviously prefer places because cuz they

245
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,660
always have the better exclusives no

246
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,940
matter what they have that better

247
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,550
experience now it seems like consoles

248
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,500
are becoming more like computers they're

249
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,540
much bigger they're more expensive

250
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,360
they're focusing more and hardware to

251
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,230
try and really push it but Xbox has the

252
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,960
advantage because they're already

253
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,490
integrated with Microsoft so I think if

254
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,290
they focus on that they could have an

255
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:39,080
aged edge on Sony for the first time I

256
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,570

greatest year of all-time

262
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,490

ogia cup things all right I resent that

310
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,120
some people think this is comfortable

311
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,980
that does not make them gay okay

312
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,290
people who think spongebob is gay forgot

313
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,360
that he suffocated himself in the

314
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,360
ultimate sip my new verse Andy I

315
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,069
remember that episode fishy ain't gay so

316
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,800
y'all are gonna call me gay like Patrick

317
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:35,790
ain't do this people pointed out an

318
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,730
article from 2015 saying that Hilda Berg

319
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,660
reported that I consider them almost

320
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,550
asexual Wow

321
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,500
are you telling me a cartoon for kids

322
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:48,610
doesn't have to have anything to do with

323
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,920
sex they're responsible shame shame but

324
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,569
then again people pointed out that

325
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,370
people who thoughts bunch of boys gay

326
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:56,290
years ago people hearing spongebob is

327
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,149
gay now people when they hear he's

328
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,920
actually asexual because he's a sponge

329
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:03,010
and a cartoon character

330
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,800
apparently asexual counts as LGBTQ plush

331
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:09,040
so there you have it case solved

332
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,050
spongebob he ain't gay but either way

333
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,930
that's so gay

334
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,130
because respond she's a sponge I think

335
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,560
the main thing to learn from this is

336
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,689
that Squidward has a thick ass at least

337
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:24,330
that's what I'm gonna take from this i'm

338
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:26,640
