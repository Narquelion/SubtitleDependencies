oh god people gonna complain so much I

274
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,710
thought it was funny but then I realized

275
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,240
I just made everyone confused to be like

276
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,490
boy it's just the 12 hour live stream

277
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,130
here I live in through a highlight for

278
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,440
you right here it I think I think there

279
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,720
was two moments and the entire live

280
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,340
stream that was funny

281
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,080
like crazy number one was that I

282
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,120
discovered his skeleton spawn right next

283
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:03,470
to my house and I was like this is

284
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:06,230
awesome so I decided to build a mob farm

285
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,490
or a spawn forum and I never built one

286
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,050
before so I had to follow this tutorial

287
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,060
and it took like it was kind of

288
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,040
frustrating because it wasn't very good

289
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,320
tutorial as well I gotta say soon it

290
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,170
just me yeah we're five hours in almost

291
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,340
six hours in I'm almost done and I can't

292
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,190
people be like you should do something

293
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,210
else I'm like no that payoff is gonna be

294
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,400
worth it

295
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:28,060
so it's bling on hardcore as well so if

296
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,620
you die in hardcore it's obviously over

297
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,150
we just place away my items in case I

298
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,950
die Wow

299
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:37,360
foreshadowing Felix you've got to watch

300
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:39,730
my weight everyone no I would never make

301
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,830
such a noob mistake I did for it was

302
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,620
done and I forgot to remove a torch and

303
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:48,430
then he got all dark and I decided to

304
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:53,890
just go through it let me hold this in

305
00:15:48,430 --> 00:16:06,730
my friend and then they pushed me in my

306
00:15:53,890 --> 00:16:13,960
own trap no oh so bad

307
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:16,750

308
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:19,420

356
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,510
drop and if the ender pearl only drops

357
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,120
one testicle

358
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,010
