why am I so butthurt this is like it

1060
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:41,980
happened right away we've barely gotten

1061
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:49,210
started on the game and they just killed

1062
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:51,630
Joel why why can they wait at least if

1063
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:54,040
they wanted to kill up the character I

1064
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:58,800
made you a sandwich sorry about your

1065
01:21:54,040 --> 01:22:04,420
dead dad hey hey

1066
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:06,010
they let her go Joel was like a father

1067
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:09,930
to me let's sit down please

1068
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:11,740
for real it was such a great character

1069
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:13,870
it was so fun

1070
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:20,230
their interaction that was what made the

1071
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:29,230
game good what and now I'm no it's like

1072
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:31,960
this everything makes sense now

1073
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:39,600
oh the Debbie hey Marie wants to make

1074
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:39,600
sure you're eating she can't stop us

1075
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:49,940
so the point of the game is revenge then

1076
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:54,650
they have the guys that we would need to

1077
01:22:49,940 --> 01:23:02,840
do this smart we believe in Jackson

1078
01:22:54,650 --> 01:23:06,830
vulnerable so they just get to get away

1079
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:12,020
with this nobody wants that yeah but

1080
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:13,670
that's what's happening what if we get

1081
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:17,810
hit by hunters again is this you talking

1082
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:19,820
or is this her it's a valid point if it

1083
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:23,239
were you or me Joel would be halfway to

1084
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:25,430
Seattle already no he wouldn't

1085
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:27,110
absolutely [ __ ] would be well we

1086
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:29,600

1087
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:30,830
from Seattle Washington Liberation Front

1088
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,110

1089
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:36,800

different tone for the trailer

1107
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:18,420
except you waited seven years for the

movie to come out oh god I don't want to

1109
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:21,780
judge the game before I played it yet I

1110
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:25,620
mean maybe there's some twists and turns

1111
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:28,020
who knows clearly there's twists but

1112
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:34,680
it's like this is why I don't get hyped

1113
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:36,240

strings with iron sound brighter they

1177
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:06,719

1267
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:18,480
that pretty baby I think that's the way

1268
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:29,860
to get through this

1269
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:31,840
so how lost are we little that's that's

1270
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:34,630
the goal right now those crazy cannibals

1271
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:37,630

1272
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:40,979

1275
01:38:43,469 --> 01:38:45,599

god everything okay what was that sound

1446
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:23,640
I got that gate open got to figure out

1447
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:29,850
this one now well we believe in you

1448
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:32,310
Thanks can they have like a Oh Debbie's

1449
01:54:29,850 --> 01:54:36,870
bad we need to get her and still keep

1450
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:43,140
Jolla line when they justify wouldn't

1451
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:45,030
change anything then they can explore

1452
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:47,610
the whole concept that the game ended on

1453
01:54:45,030 --> 01:54:49,890
with the why Joel was an upfront with

1454
01:54:47,610 --> 01:54:54,000
her have this really emotional

1455
01:54:49,890 --> 01:55:00,920
conclusion to it and then maybe kill

1456
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:04,710
Joel in like the third one just thought

1457
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:12,090

the gate for the lazy [ __ ] see

1478
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:03,310

1568
02:03:57,010 --> 02:04:05,720

1569
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:10,030

nice yes yes yes yes dude all right I

1572
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:20,590
got an idea what if it turns out Joel

1573
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:24,230
was Jojo and he was he was packing

1574
02:04:20,590 --> 02:04:26,240
magazines under his shirt so he actually

1575
02:04:24,230 --> 02:04:28,520
didn't take any damage even though it

1576
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:31,160
looked like it was dead but but Jojo and

1577
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:39,410
Jojo Joel have similar names and they're

1578
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:41,120
both smart and epic oh [ __ ] so maybe

1579
02:04:39,410 --> 02:04:46,370
joel is alive and that's the plot twist

1580
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:49,160
and that's why you know I mean Buster's

1581
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:50,750
my theory and I like that there a lot so

1582
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:54,230
I'm just gonna stick with that Joel is

1583
02:04:50,750 --> 02:05:00,470
alive and he's packing magazines under

1584
02:04:54,230 --> 02:05:00,770
his shirt anyone yes but he was hit in

1585
02:05:00,470 --> 02:05:04,580
the head

1586
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:09,040
you can pack magazines in the head never

1587
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:09,040
done that crunch oh no

1588
02:05:13,030 --> 02:05:19,190

1592
02:05:35,210 --> 02:05:47,460
should we take these guys out and can

1593
02:05:39,150 --> 02:05:56,820
you progress with that let's try with

1594
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:57,719
that if we don't look at them and they

1595
02:05:56,820 --> 02:06:06,809
