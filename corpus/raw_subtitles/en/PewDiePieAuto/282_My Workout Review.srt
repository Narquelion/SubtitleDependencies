1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
how's it going bros my name is ohmygod

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,589
peered pie wreaked paid the price so

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,380
strong this has basically been all over

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:14,849
any form of social media oh my god ah

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,690
it's basically being plastered on my

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,920
subreddit

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,570
they even had to close send the

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,289
subreddit because people kept posting

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,990
about it this isn't the why however but

10
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:27,150
54,000 people want a workout review so

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,920
that's what we're gonna do today I'm I

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,570
wasn't planning to talk about it or make

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,880
a video like this in a long time at

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,649
least I don't know six months a year to

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,469
for me to actually gain some muscle

16
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,170
I'm not ripped okay I'm just lean or

17
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,239
what there's a difference I I feel like

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,829
I still have a long way to go but what

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,140
happened was I was putting up some light

20
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:51,360
outside I mean that was challenging

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:54,170
ceiling game as you can see my workout

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,379
routines hundred tambourine hits add a

23
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,840
hundred mics it came out and she was

24
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,370
like damn so she's not the photo of me

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,700
and they should we both looked at it

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,320
like what the even I was shocked I had

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,750
any workout that day it's not like I was

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,340
pumped up or anything so she shared it

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,310
on her social media because you know

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,490
it's lame if I share it and goddamn

31
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,590
people freaked out did not expect that I

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,509
guess since people always I've always

33
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,430
been very skinny for a very long time

34
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,110
and people always see me that that's oh

35
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,570
do you gain any form of muscle it and

36
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:32,220
people are like what yeah this is me

37
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:35,009
before yep oh yeah there it is I'm glad

38
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,259
that photo exists and yeah this is me

39
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,329
now I guess at the end at the end of the

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,170
montage I need a couple more montages

41
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,060
come on I saw people online debating if

42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,829
I'm using roids or any sort of

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,909
supplement it's like I don't even know

44
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,970
what they're talking about I don't know

45
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,430
what it means I'm not that strong and

46
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,530
other people were just going like oh oh

47
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,780
he's got a super-rich he's got like a

48
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,450
super good trainer pumping him every day

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,700
and he's got like this insane gym at

50
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,829
home he can afford it so I thought why

51
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,320
don't I just start off by showing what

52
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,440
my gym looks like welcome and here's my

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,620
gym set it Eggar spots me thank you very

54
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,140
much

55
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:20,170
so basically it's just as what is it

56
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:22,600
call Finch it's garbage it's so bad it's

57
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,920
so bulky I swear to God I feel like if I

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,090
ever die it's because this thing

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,740
collapses on me half the time the screws

60
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:35,620
are coming off and I have to keep

61
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:38,500
screwing them in so they ignite these

62
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,900
are super nifty and the way they work is

63
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,510
that you can very quickly change each

64
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,350
weight that you want you want 30 40 60

65
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,740
50 70 it goes up to 90 actually I have

66
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:56,560
90 here that's why and even ten without

67
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:58,870
anything okay for 130 BAM lifts up ready

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,480
to go and that's why I have this risk

69
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,930
protection because it hits my wrists

70
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,760
sometimes and it hurts a lot so I got

71
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,040
these I actually recommend it if you're

72
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,100
using these let me feel more badass

73
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,080
somehow I don't know why it does have a

74
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,930
problem which is that if I want to make

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,790
a jump it's a high jump to go from 80 to

76
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:24,430
90 pounds that's from from 36 kilos to

77
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,940
41 instead of going from 36 kilos to

78
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,660
maybe

79
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,850
38 or 39 it takes me a lot longer to

80
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,250
jump in in weight basically that's the

81
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,990
problem I have with these but it saves

82
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,150
you a lot of money and a lot of space to

83
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,370
not have a whole rack with dumbbells

84
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,660
which would be nice I should probably

85
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:47,950
get that but these are cheaper I also

86
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:49,870
have these which are good for it's good

87
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:55,900
for extra grip when you're doing pool

88
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:57,760
exercises they're okay they're not that

89
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,160
great it's just very frustrating

90
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,459
again I'm filming it is very frustrating

91
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,870
when you're trying to hit away and you

92
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,790
know you can do it but you're losing

93
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,840
grip I hate that so much so these help

94
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,900
and that's pretty much it

95
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:18,040
I put my workout Journal here next to

96
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:21,100
all day all the chemicals so I write

97
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,310
down all the this is me day one I was

98
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,710
doing flat press 50-member soon cemani

99
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,310
and then I could do it's not that bad

100
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,650
actually

101
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,139
I haven't improved that much it's just I

102
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,630
hurt my arm recently so I haven't really

103
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,970
I'm careful I'm careful what the show

104
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,360
here cuz sometimes I write down I get

105
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,990
angry and I write down about your show

106
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,990
do it [ __ ]

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,840
so it's notes for me for the next week I

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,880
always go through what I did the

109
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,040
previous week so I'm like yeah next time

110
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,570
do this [ __ ] you wimp

111
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:01,000
right arm weak very compared to left

112
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,400
yeah this is two weeks ago I hurt my arm

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,110
this is probably dumbbells and don't

114
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,530
make the mistakes I made properly

115
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,419
warm-up make the right movements because

116
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,700
if you get injured you're you're out for

117
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:14,650
three weeks at least it takes that long

118
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,990
for the muscles to recover it it's very

119
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,960
easy to get damage with dumbbells I also

120
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,120
hurt my back from lifting down the

121
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,160
dumbbells which is equally important so

122
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,229
if you're working out with dumbbells be

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,169
careful I'm saying it to myself in the

124
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:32,200
past it's not worth it to get injured

125
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,090
just take it slow but yeah I think it's

126
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,010
cool I like the idea that anyone can

127
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,419
pick up this with in their house it's

128
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,380
very small it doesn't take up a lot of

129
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:43,210
space and it's fairly cost efficient if

130
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,460
you have if you don't have access to a

131
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,220
gym this is a pretty good space I would

132
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,900
say gym is always better because you're

133
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,550
gonna have machines and you're not gonna

134
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,340
hurt yourself like I do like a skinny

135
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,380
again that's my setup setup for I know

136
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,390
my my setup is and I know I could get

137
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,190
more but I just really like the idea

138
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,020
that I can move it anywhere

139
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,370
it feels very liberating to have that

140
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,140
kind of set up and you can do a ton with

141
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,630
dumbbells like I said in the video so

142
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,300
just be careful that's all

143
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,580
so I've never actually spoken about my

144
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,380
workout history or whatever in 2016 I

145
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,570
had never been to a gym before in my

146
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,070
entire life and I I didn't know anything

147
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,630
I don't know how to properly squat I

148
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:23,110
didn't know what reps meant I didn't

149
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,910
know what sets meant I but I wanted to

150
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,950
try and get in shape in better shape at

151
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,760
least so I kind of forced myself to go

152
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:34,419
to a gym I I was terrified I had no idea

153
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,610
what to expect and it was just the

154
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,560
overconfidence in me

155
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,780
just said I'll cage you just go in there

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,159
and just how hard can it be you just put

157
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,509
up and down weights anyone can do that

158
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,580
don't be me basically what I'm saying if

159
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:50,069
you've never been touching before ask a

160
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,020
friend to introduce you or or even

161
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:53,159
better and ask one of the personal

162
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,219
trainers at the gym they'll definitely

163
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:58,050
be one and they'll help you out I keep

164
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:00,509
seeing the sentiment that people that

165
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,189
are maybe overweight or don't feel

166
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,590
confident about their body or I feel

167
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,340
like they're gonna be judged or

168
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,810
something like that that you just

169
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,849
couldn't be further from a true and I

170
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,979
gotta say the personal trainers that I

171
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:14,340
worked with have just been the most

172
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:16,680
motivating and supportive people because

173
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,000
that's their job you know it's so

174
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,340
definitely don't be scared to do that

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,349
and to just get started a lot of gyms

176
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,750
will offer one personal trainer for free

177
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:26,340
so it's a hundred percent worth it

178
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,860
absolutely you need to know what you're

179
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,719
doing going into a gym so I surely after

180
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,849
I switched gyms and I got started with a

181
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:34,259
personal trainer which was really good

182
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:36,800
he taught me to how to really push

183
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:40,050
myself how to workout with dumbbells

184
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,289
ironically this is me after going to the

185
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:46,289
gym you can tell there's some muscle

186
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:48,509
yeah okay maybe I don't know I think the

187
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:51,569
most strong I was at the time was in

188
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:59,370
this video you can sorta tell there's

189
00:07:51,569 --> 00:08:01,349
some muscle there but not a lot this was

190
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,779
really good the problem was that I

191
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:06,120
didn't have a goal with my exercise I

192
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:09,150
just sort of went with it which was a

193
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,589
big mistake and I knew you know at the

194
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,029
back of my mind I was working myself to

195
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:13,620
the point where I was throwing up you

196
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:15,210
know I was really almost I wasn't

197
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,669
actually throwing up but when you feel

198
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,409
like oh god I cannot give any more which

199
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,909
is common when you start off and you

200
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:22,560
haven't worked out before but in the

201
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:24,210
back of my mind I was like there's no

202
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,180
way I can maintain this for a long time

203
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,789
you know so lo and behold I got sick I

204
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,199
got a stomach flow that was really bad

205
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,349
and they knocked me out for two to three

206
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,539
weeks and after that I just I just never

207
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,339
picked it up again and any sort of

208
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,729
progress that I've gained from from

209
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:44,910
those months at the gym after a year you

210
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,260
know I was still fit but it most of the

211
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,510
games were gone

212
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,220
and so I decided to myself okay I'll

213
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,230
just set up a bench I'll set up some

214
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,550
dumb little side home and I can just

215
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,500
work out from that you know and this

216
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,540
time I'm not gonna make the same mistake

217
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,670
I'm just gonna be consistent and I'm not

218
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,340
gonna overdo it so I did that for a year

219
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,650
this really measly workout just to be

220
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,330
consistent because you know I've been

221
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,070
consistent on YouTube and that sort of

222
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,700
been my success so that can translate

223
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,160
into exercise and yeah it just got to a

224
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,020
point where I was fed up and I I wanted

225
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,340
to really start pushing myself and I did

226
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,260
that two months ago and that's when I

227
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,940
really started to notice the big

228
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,430
difference that you've seen in the

229
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,590
photos today and this is after reading a

230
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,900
lot of books reading a lot of philosophy

231
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,980
you guys know I'm a fan of Mishima so if

232
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,200
you know Mishima that's pretty

233
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,430
self-explanatory for those who don't

234
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,440
know Mishima was an author that was

235
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:38,460
absolutely ripped he talked a lot of my

236
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,620
body and action wishes a message today

237
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,880
that seems completely lost and I read a

238
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,310
bunch of other books as well that helped

239
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,550
me develop my philosophy around exercise

240
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,650
which seems kind of cringy and and like

241
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,450
it doesn't match no work at it that's

242
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,910
for dummies which couldn't be further

243
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,460
from the truth if anything body and soul

244
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,960
are are deeply connected and I wanted

245
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,520
them to match and that's why I really

246
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,680
wanted to start pushing myself with my

247
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,080
work AB so this time I had a clear goal

248
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,690
what I was getting into so I just needed

249
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,920
to push myself this time but how I

250
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,260
didn't have it I don't have a personal

251
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,940
trainer anymore so I sort of became my

252
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,860
own personal trainer I knew which

253
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,140
workout that was needed to be done I

254
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,400
just didn't know how to not slack off

255
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,690
because it's easier to slack off when

256
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,430
you work out on your own it's totally

257
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,080
possible to to work out on your own but

258
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,510
it's always better with a trainer or a

259
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,910
friend or with someone else so I started

260
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,280
tracking down my training I wrote down

261
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:33,740
in a journal which you saw earlier my

262
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:35,820
reps my sights the weights and how much

263
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,100
rest time I would keep and I would

264
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,510
really try and push myself each time to

265
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,250
make sure I was making progress

266
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,620
in retrospect I don't think that was the

267
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,380
most important thing to do their most

268
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,720
important thing is to really do it until

269
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,910
you fail like you can't push any longer

270
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,660
that should be the goal instead but it

271
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,540
worked out for me

272
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,960
so my workout routine finally we got to

273
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,740
it I'm sorry for so much talking

274
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,650
so Monday's I do push exercises I do

275
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,240
chest heavily on chest everyone keeps

276
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,430
making fun of my chest in the in the

277
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,250
photo but it looks better in person

278
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:13,430
trust me it's massive I got a huge tease

279
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,990
and then I finish off with shoulders I

280
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,970
don't remember it in my head but it's

281
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,510
something like that and then Tuesdays I

282
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:23,570
do leg squats deadlifts yada yada lunges

283
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:26,390
and then Wednesday I do pull exercises

284
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,190
then Thursday I do leg a and leg again

285
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,200
and then Friday I finish with a mix of

286
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,060
push and pull I know there's other

287
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,380
variations of this sort of workout that

288
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,450
are more efficient and I'm probably

289
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,270
gonna change my workout pretty soon but

290
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,460
it worked out for me so far I literally

291
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:43,010
just googled online like five day

292
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:45,620
dumbbell workout and you could probably

293
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,090
find it yourself and follow it so or

294
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,650
maybe I'll leave a link to an in

295
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,570
description if you want to try what I

296
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,030
did the most important thing is to

297
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,150
really push yourself until you fail but

298
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,680
the next thing which is very important

299
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,720
and people always say that it's

300
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,540
important but then they just ignore it

301
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,010
anyway but it is equally important

302
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,710
because when you're lifting weight

303
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,630
you're only burning so many calories no

304
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,880
matter how heavy of an exercise you

305
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,700
don't really lose weight more in lifting

306
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,740
weights ironically you have to change

307
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,660
your diet if you want to lose body fat

308
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,360
and the probably the biggest difference

309
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:23,330
for me was cutting out alcohol which is

310
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,430
something I talked about before I'd say

311
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,530
maybe a year ago I quit alcohol for the

312
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,750
first time yes you guys know I like my

313
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:32,750
whiskey too much I like my whiskey too

314
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,980
much which was not healthy I didn't feel

315
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,660
good about it so I quit alcohol

316
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,760
completely and I did that for a couple

317
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,800
months and I felt okay great you know I

318
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,810
can actually do this but then afterwards

319
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,610
I just fell back into my old habits and

320
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,680
I felt you can be and terrible about it

321
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,780
like I was slowly killing myself it's

322
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,640
great so I so I basically made the same

323
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,710
mistake I did with my workout as I did

324
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,150
with my eating or drinking rather and

325
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,680
there was obviously a lot of calories

326
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,870
and drinking that's not the reason I

327
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,510
quit but it helps to have another reason

328
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:03,290
to quit it I decided to just cut off

329
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:05,180
hard liquor from my palate I just

330
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,020
realized it's not for me if other people

331
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:11,920
like it that's great I just know I'm not

332
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,600
never again I do drink maybe like a pint

333
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,970
of beer once a week if I'm hanging out

334
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,560
with friends online or whatever I drink

335
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,510
socially basically if someone saying hey

336
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,950
as so as services and talk about how

337
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,470
it's important to let your spirit loose

338
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,270
and I kind of agree with that I was I

339
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,340
think the problem was before when I quit

340
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,020
drinking is that I was too strict on it

341
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,750
I didn't want to be that person in the

342
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,610
friend group and I think this way I'm

343
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,070
just gonna be able to to stick with it

344
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,110
and honestly quitting drinking it it was

345
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,750
hard it was a habit that I had develop

346
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,880
and like you probably have some food or

347
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,530
some craving that you really feel

348
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,450
strongly about maybe you don't realize

349
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,360
that you're addicted to it but once you

350
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,860
cut it out of your your diet that's when

351
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,870
you realize that you are addicted to it

352
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,910
and you sort of just like you trained

353
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,320
yourself to like that food and depend on

354
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,450
that food you have to train yourself to

355
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,730
not be dependent on it and that's really

356
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,200
tough in the beginning but once you get

357
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,510
out of it you've gained a whole

358
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,130
different perspective and youie even me

359
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,110
looking back on my old drinking habits I

360
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,780
have really looked back on it with the

361
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,210
test and in the shame of my past self

362
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,900
you have to realize that sensational

363
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,030
pleasures

364
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,850
don't bring happiness and as soon as you

365
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,500
take that first wipe it's already

366
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,930
fleeting it's not gonna make you happy

367
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,170
now I feel like there's almost a social

368
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,730
idea that you need food to be happy oh I

369
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,730
need these food because they make me

370
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,940
happy or whatever which isn't true

371
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:37,420
recently there was a comedian Kumail

372
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:40,030
Nanjiani who got really really ripped

373
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,680
for Marvel role this is really

374
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,990
impressive Jesus Christ those veins

375
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,990
breath and I saw he went on the Kimmel

376
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,670
show and they had prepared this like

377
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,320
funny idea where okay so you reached

378
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,640
your goal now now we're gonna set you

379
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,060
off with a bunch of cakes and a bunch of

380
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,660
pizzas

381
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:58,620
yeah something special for you please go

382
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,620
ahead and be careful

383
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,690
[Music]

384
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,360
and I get it it's it's just a funny

385
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,490
thing but I also feel like this shows

386
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,830
the to me at least the idea that oh you

387
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,950
like these sort of things are dependent

388
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,660
for for becoming happy or it reinforces

389
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:22,880
it at the very least it doesn't state it

390
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:26,210
necessarily gonna happen and I remember

391
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,470
very specifically the day we were like

392
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,970
is she gonna make it is she gonna make

393
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,280
it and I remember when I got to the

394
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:34,220
hospital one of those days and went and

395
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:40,190
she was up and sitting on her bed I'm

396
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:42,080
happier right now sorry this video just

397
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,390
became me ranting about different topics

398
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,160
hopefully it is helpful for people to

399
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,630
understand my mindset because I really

400
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,520
think mindset is one of the most

401
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,290
important things if you want to work out

402
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,120
you can obviously anyone can pick up

403
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,560
working out for a little while but

404
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,510
unless you have the right mindset you're

405
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,490
not gonna be able to be consistently

406
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:02,030
pushing yourself for it one of the best

407
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,860
things I done out of all of these and

408
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:07,430
and the change in my life that I'm the

409
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:10,160
most happy about is I looked up how much

410
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,650
protein I needed you can do this as well

411
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,910
I'll link a little website down below so

412
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,340
you can put in your weight you can put

413
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,410
in your height and then you can put in

414
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,630
how much you work out and then it tells

415
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,210
you okay well this is roughly what your

416
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:27,020
daily protein intake should be and mine

417
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:28,820
was just way off so I started just

418
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,400
stuffing myself with a bunch of protein

419
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,440
snacks you know protein bars nuts that

420
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,270
have a lot of protein it's not as great

421
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,840
but it's if you want something savory

422
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,150
it's good

423
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,950
this was life-changing for me because I

424
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,420
used to struggle a lot with anger I

425
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:45,200
never really I talked about actually my

426
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,600
sources and video about anger and I have

427
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,680
made the habit of being very angry often

428
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,120
and very confrontational and aggressive

429
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,070
at first I liked that part of myself

430
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,440
because I thought oh this is another

431
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,480
sort of image of a man kind of like

432
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,360
whisky is seen as manly you know it's

433
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,940
it's society looks at anger a lot of

434
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,920
ways as something manly as well and I

435
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,440
think recognizing these things as just

436
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,410
that and I started meditating on it a

437
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,450
lot

438
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,460
I was able to control my anger much much

439
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,890
better so this doesn't really help with

440
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,930
that as well but I would still you know

441
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,150
feel it I would still feel that anger

442
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,100
even though I didn't act on it the same

443
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,720
way I used to I will feel happy now with

444
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,520
virtuous by the fact that I wasn't

445
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,320
acting on my anger anymore but I wasn't

446
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,880
my happy self that I would you normally

447
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,880
used to be and as much as I would like

448
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,950
to at least but protein makes you self

449
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,350
so much fuller and it doesn't make your

450
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,540
at least for me my blood sugar spike is

451
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,730
much so if that problem for me which was

452
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,710
a big problem just completely

453
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:47,190
disappeared just by me trying to eat

454
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:49,680
more protein so I'm so happy I made that

455
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,450
change it wasn't intentional but it's

456
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,700
just something that just worked out

457
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,440
really well for me I guess last thing

458
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,280
working out will not solve all your

459
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,990
problems it will not fix any sort of

460
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,060
issues there's obviously many reasons to

461
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,820
work out that are very positive you you

462
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,040
will you'll look better you'll feel more

463
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,780
confident you'll be more healthy but

464
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:17,490
these are obviously degenerate reasons

465
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:19,470
to work out you exercise you extra lift

466
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,510
weights for Mishima okay you lift

467
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,970
weights for homework you lift weights to

468
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,640
escape abstract concepts like time and

469
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,500
death that's the only acceptable reasons

470
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,660
and just lastly if you feel good about

471
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,490
yourself already there's there's no

472
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,710
shape whatever size or shape you are I

473
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:37,440
don't care all right if you feel good

474
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,660
about yourself all right great excellent

475
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,820
this is not a video to make it like you

476
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,620
have to be like this or you have to have

477
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,090
this mindset to be happy then this is

478
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,280
just something that worked for me and

479
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,960
I'm very happy about it and it's been

480
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,090
really motivational as well to see so

481
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,330
many support around it I think that's

482
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,640
great

483
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,700
and I really appreciate it I really feel

484
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,740
like jimbros are the most supportive

485
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,780
people out there so yeah this is my

486
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,180
partner so far maybe in a year I'll make

487
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,040
another video when a more in depth on my

488
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,990
workout once I actually know how to do

489
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,790
it properly I don't want to spread

490
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,740
misinformation and stuff like that but I

491
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,950
I feel confident in what I said today at

492
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,470
least so there thanks for watching
