1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,099
Oh bro Ganga welcome everyone

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:11,250
ten years ten years

3
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:13,049
Manitoba silence ten freaking years we

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,929
did it if you don't know why I'm saying

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,910
ten years my channel just hit its

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,850
ten-year anniversary I've been uploading

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,580
consistently on YouTube for ten years I

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,119
think even longer but technically I

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,699
started pd pi channel ten years ago

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,230
amazing thank you for watching I wonder

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,110
how many of you have watched for like 10

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,550
years you literally grew up with me it's

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,079
pretty weird to think about I sometimes

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,360
see comments and people being like

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,629
alright I watched you when I was like 14

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,550
and I'm 20 now it's like I don't know

17
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,809
why that's so weird to me well skip all

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,969
this sappy [ __ ]

19
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,469
first I want to just I'm gonna go

20
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,780
through each year I want to watch a

21
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,579
video from every year that and kind of

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,530
see what the difference are I think it's

23
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,989
kind of funny to look how much has

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,370
changed over 10 years I almost at just

25
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,559
10 years like it's a short time or

26
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,239
something and I wanted to look at some

27
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,280
videos that I private it for whatever

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,960
reason make it maybe a bit more

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,750
interesting I found this one call of

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,170
duty black ops team deathmatch 48 for

31
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,299
season score I smash liked on it myself

32
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,220
I can't read the comments because I I

33
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,650
pry veted it but let's put a public

34
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,640
again alright what are the comments no

35
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,670
comments

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,439
that's so sad a ton review so that's

37
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,360
pretty good everyone keeps referencing

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,710
my first video as if I played Minecraft

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,810
just because it's the first one on my

40
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,030
channel no this is what I did I played

41
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,970
Call of Duty like everyone else was

42
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,130
doing but it was fun I said to myself

43
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,049
like is it a good idea to use a warlord

44
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,369
and you will mags with suppressor

45
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,640
because yeah that's really interesting

46
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,649
alright let's move forward it's fun but

47
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,820
yeah probably why people are hating on

48
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,890
them is because they die of them so

49
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,610
was I talking about the helicopter

50
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,470
that's how I make sense of it and they

51
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,120
shut it down anyway so it doesn't really

52
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,060
come on let's see some good gameplay I'm

53
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:05,200
curious now I think and my dog hates me

54
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,810
I got no feels I hate oh try to knife me

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,630
why I do wrong what am I talking about

56
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,690
no consistency the nuke though no

57
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,580
coherent thoughts I remember when I got

58
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,320
my to be fair though this was kind of

59
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,650
the style at the time I remember I

60
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,870
watching other people that were

61
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,310
successful on as Call of Duty commentary

62
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,340
it's the same sort of style like like

63
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,410
huh I said that that's weird so even

64
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,060
though I find it's very cringing I was

65
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,620
just mimicking what was popular at the

66
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,840
time all right first nuke

67
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,220
I was so excited I was screaming you

68
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,130
know everything I was like mom you have

69
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,690
to come see this she was like no all

70
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,510
right I'm gonna stop it right there

71
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,310
okay he doesn't tell me at 2010 I think

72
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,200
I had about 100 subscribers or maybe

73
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,989
something like that I remember someone

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,940
else like a big youtuber referenced in a

75
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:54,580
tweet somewhere saying like oh I

76
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,430
remember when I only had 300 subscribers

77
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,410
and I was like [ __ ] only 300 I'm

78
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,500
sitting here at 100 do you know how hard

79
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,950
this is like this is a long time to do

80
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,070
something without getting any disability

81
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,320
something clearly happened in 2011 let's

82
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:16,120
find out okay so this is me playing our

83
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,900
winni and I titled it funny that is very

84
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,900
funny

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,930
[Laughter]

86
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,670
[Music]

87
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:47,010
this is like the mark sample ice isn't

88
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,959
it the the Brad pity pot might have Brad

89
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,700
might say was this funny by the way I

90
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,579
was sitting on the floor here holy crap

91
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,950
I can't um I made the full circle we

92
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,260
moved into this place Myanmar since no

93
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,609
is this before maybe I don't know for

94
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,470
exactly when I did but I remember

95
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,120
sitting on the floor because we didn't

96
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,159
have a table it was so tiny I was like

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,920
I'm better off on the floor that's funny

98
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,359
full circle gamers Laura gave her life I

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,920
told you I'm consistent

100
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:16,739
I told you so let's jump to 2012 I was

101
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,900
at is that possible 3 million already

102
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,760
damn it was the time when I was in

103
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,109
Sweden that's why I had this video here

104
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,669
because look what I found

105
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:27,060
going through privates I found a video

106
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:30,530
that I made for Myers yet I would send

107
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,349
her videos because she'd really liked it

108
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:36,180
yeah this is to crunch dough and I don't

109
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:45,720
really want to show it but I want to see

110
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:47,520
like a little bit alright I can't I'm

111
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,710
sorry I know you probably want to see

112
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,490
more I can show with our dog family dog

113
00:04:49,710 --> 00:05:01,199
at the time and the quality of camera is

114
00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:03,360
the same it's incredible yeah 2013

115
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,159
bada-bing bada-boom

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,229
this is how many I gained it doesn't

117
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:09,930
show like it doesn't actually show like

118
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:12,360
yeah look it just so shows gain I guess

119
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,729
it gives you an a good idea 16 million

120
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,460
how's that even possible

121
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:17,950
2013

122
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:22,030
[Music]

123
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:24,880
yeah how's it going read my name and

124
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,310
welcomed so now we're in Italy I moved

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,810
to mindset to Italy that was part of the

126
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,150
deal she stayed in Sweden for a while

127
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,800
and then we stay in Italy for a while it

128
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,110
was really fun that actually I filmed

129
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:43,540
this is so weird I can't play a tune

130
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:45,850
there it's not Friday I would never get

131
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,200
it on Friday did I remember I got so

132
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,000
much hate during this time because my

133
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,000
channel just blew up and that was kind

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,650
of like the cringy I mean I was never

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,260
family-friendly but a lot of kids

136
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,930
obviously watched me cuz I it was just

137
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,570
swearing constantly that was the humor

138
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,000
and loud noises it obviously attracted a

139
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,460
lot of young audience it's a lot of

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,310
people are like who's this in screechie

141
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,310
annoying prick so I would say between

142
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,380
2012 and 2013 it was one I probably had

143
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,770
the most fun because it was just me and

144
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,410
my audience and pure acceleration but

145
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,270
then a lot I remember like a lot of

146
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,950
haters would sit in and it would be I've

147
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,750
never dealt with that before as well so

148
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,220
I didn't really know I didn't have the

149
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,140
tools to deal with it they didn't bother

150
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,700
me that much but I remember it was kind

151
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,740
of tough because he felt like oh

152
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,320
everyone just thinks I'm a dumbass

153
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,860
cool I did it throw my life that was

154
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,030
pretty cool

155
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:43,570
35 years I think I just drew penis my

156
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:47,980
real name given by my mama and Dada was

157
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:50,380
Felix Felix is Latin and means happy

158
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,390
since the day I was born I was living up

159
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,000
to this name what is wrong with me why

160
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,860
do I draw like that nothing has changed

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,960
when it turned comes to drawing so I

162
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,610
could work better in Photoshop but I

163
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,770
also bought it to do something I had

164
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,080
been wanting to make for years all right

165
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,370
I don't want to re regurgitate is that

166
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,530
the right word because I talked about

167
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,900
this whole summary how I started already

168
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:13,780
but I just want to know like what I did

169
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,550
during that time so we moved to UK the

170
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,860
same year actually and I want to be the

171
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,040
best boyfriend I can possibly be

172
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,590

sure of it

181
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,940
I thought it was pretty cool and I think

182
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,500

vlogging that's what I'm saying great oh

216
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:30,110
yeah because I was going on some late

217
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:34,160
night show I think it was Colbert like

218
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:38,270
30 minutes feel like I'm mushy

219
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,090
my network pushed me way too much I'm

220
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:43,310
signing posters so like I always had

221
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,570
something to do I mean fair enough like

222
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,190
that's their job and I could have said

223
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,250
no to a lot of things - oh yeah and we

224
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:55,790
were working on the game legend of the

225
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:57,890
brofist these guys were awesome like

226
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,500
Rufus season one we're great I think it

227
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,840
was in was into 2015 that I mean that I

228
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,100
was gonna delete my channel and I I know

229
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,680
I don't know if I said this before I

230
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,600
think I have but I was never I mean did

231
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,190
like haha I gotcha but the original idea

232
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,350
was intentional because I was just so

233
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,110
done I was so overworked there was way

234
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,720
too much and I was fed up with being so

235
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,030
famous like I just realized I wasn't

236
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,710
enjoying it I I wished it was the time

237
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,930
when I wish I had a smaller Channel and

238
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,880
no one knew who I was kind of because I

239
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,340
missed those times back in 2012 when it

240
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,190
was just like me and my audience and the

241
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,280
acceleration and the hype but and I felt

242
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,940
like I had lost time 2016 Bert about you

243
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,220

246
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,940
have done that

247
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,770
such a bad idea this is really the

248
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,020
breaking point and I really wanted it to

249
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:52,070

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:54,800

imagine but I feel like though as I've

293
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,019
done on that and done all these things I

294
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,000
realized at the end of it what I enjoy

295
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,569
doing is creating content just for my

296
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,670

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,689
busy as I've been I've always put that

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,850
