00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,099
eight Wi-Fi routers to make a meme

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,900
because it's cheaper than buying editing

8
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,260

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,059

to watch oh my god if life is a video

88
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,100
game the graphics are great but the plot

89
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,229
is confusing and the tutorial is way too

90
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,140
long if life is a video game the plot is

91
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:37,080
extremely boring and dragged out and the

92
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,470
payoff isn't that good in the end and

93
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,180
all the side characters are so annoying

94
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,650
truth hurts ready it's just social media

95
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,780
for people who think they're too smart

96
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,180
for social media never before have I

97
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,580
been so offended by something i 100%

98
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,260
agree with i can't really fault that i

99
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,870
can't really fault that peers are saying

100
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:58,440
i have big PP me being a girl

101
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,169
big PP people that walk fast are

102
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,090
reported to be less happy the problem of

103
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,430
being faster than light is that you can

104
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,780
only live in darkness the problem with

105
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,910
being faster than light is that it's

106
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,979
physically impossible so go

107
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,990
yourself sonic yeah I can see that it

108
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,820
seems like in big cities when people are

109
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,110
in a rush that's why I don't like a lot

110
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,210
of big cities cuz we I don't know

111
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,099
especially London people are so rude I

112
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,950
can see people like that being miserable

113
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,290
in 1953 due to high speed the eff Allah

the good old days of awesome fan arts

153
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,680
not five minutes scribbles I don't think

154
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,630
people would like this to just be fan

155
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,630
art it's nice to see every once in a

156
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:08,390
while no one would use this it was just

157
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:11,840
fan art that's a weird metric of its

158
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:14,480
being better I I'm sure this person has

159
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,180
good reasons to feel the way they do but

160
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,800
I found in general as someone that's run

161
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,220
communities for a long time on the

162
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,500
Internet

163
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,270
after a certain while people just tend

164
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,520
to complain and a lot of times it

165
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,920
doesn't seem completely funded I would

166
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,510
say I remember mild forum back in the

167
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,610
day the exact same thing happened like

168
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,900
it was it was a fun space and then he

169
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,300
grew bigger and big and then people like

170
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,720
it sucks now because before it was

171
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,920
better because fine art

172
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,530
people complaining doesn't help either

173
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,030
Lawai is fine I would rather see a

174
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,040
caramel whoring post than people

175
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,440

198
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,680
prequel mean and relevant meme at the

199
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,630
same time big PP well done I checked

200
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,040
this on Marzia few days ago I turn on

201
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,780
the lights just to see how she would

202
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,280
react and she wanted to turn it off it's

203
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,230
one of those things that everyone was

204
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,660
just taught not to do it for whatever

205
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,160
reason and then we both laugh how stupid

206
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,750
it was cuz once you realize like yeah

207
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,520
why why why is that an issue I think I

208
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,860
know why though I think I know why

209
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,840
because they're not automatic now the

210
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,160
car lights are automatic right so the

211
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,860
thing is like the kids in the back

212
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,360
forget them on right they click um when

213
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,520
it's dark and then they leave the car

214
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,220
but then the light is on during the day

215
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,140
which is annoying and then the parent

216
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,730
has to go back in the car to turn up the

217
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,590
light that's why they said it was

218
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,840
illegal it isn't actually legal guys

219
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,670
like I'm pretty sure pretty sure at

220
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,830
least don't take my word for it like if

221
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:40,120
you go to jail for it I can't help you

222
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:43,190
but I'm pretty sure her you okay Polly

223
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,440
come on how are you not looking at doggy

224
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,860
we're spring in Edgar's ear going there

225
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,880
I'm gonna murder their Bunch

226
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,079
Oh scare that is so good no we had a

227
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,779
great Christmas okay

228
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,610
oh by the way big PP forgot big PP I

229
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:00,190
think this is just some natural

230
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,200
awkwardness that's right the flash I'm

231
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,880
the fastest man alive the camera man are

232
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,360
you challenging me oh that's a good

233
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,339
point actually I never thought of that

234
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,839
how'd this camera follow them huh I do

235
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,640
hate this I don't know why I hate this

236
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,290
Scooby Doo mean so I'm downloading it

237
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,050
and I got a voice crack while I did it

238
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,300
so I think that naturalizes it media

239
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:22,779
study shows that video games cause

240
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:26,649
violence me which study media well I

241
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,640
don't freaking know what how am I

242
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:30,250
supposed to know that

243
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,010
it's toads video games that causes all

244
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,390
those violence in America we watched

245
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,640
that movie yesterday what was it called

246
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,410
mid-90s have you seen that it's a movie

247
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,390
about growing up in the 90s where these

248
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,839
really young kids goes out drinking

249
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:46,420
doing drugs car crashes and drunk

250
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,640
driving accidents while falling on

251
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,800
skateboards all these crazy stuff and

252
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,779
you're like maybe maybe letting kids

253
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,720
play video games isn't so bad all right

254
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:57,730
parents it could be like it used to be a

255
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,199
lot worse if the only difference that is

256
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,610
that they parents see the kids and

257
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:04,209
they're like oh my god they play game

258
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:07,089
with the stinky stinky boomers be quiet

259
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:08,560
I said it be quiet boomer PewDiePie I

260
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,870
think I almost discovered everything in

261
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,440
terraria terraria veterans watching PD

262
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,510
PI it's weird it always feels like I'm

263
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,709
done with the game I do think I should

264
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,690
probably end the series though because

265
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,190
I'm going on a break soon and I think it

266
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,500
would be awkward for me to come back

267
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,440
into it even though I do enjoy terraria

268
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,930
but I'm sorry it's over senpai of poor

269
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,410
what is your wish to this sub reddit has

270
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:34,089
GOG gadget it madly made every pouch see

271
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,040
this is thing I think the reason I don't

272
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:37,990
like this impulse is because alright

273
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,790
don't don't get personally attacked okay

274
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,720
I don't get personally attacked but

275
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,519
people don't know what to think I'm not

276
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,899
talking about you I'm saying as a group

277
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,850
it's one thing I learned about being

278
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:50,019
half in charge of a group on the

279
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,640
internet they can't think for themselves

280
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:54,699
a lot of them can't think for themselves

281
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,560
so when people start saying oh this has

282
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:57,790
gone edition it kind of spirals out of

283
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,500
the way and then people don't even know

284
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,619
why they think that they just heard that

285
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,600
other people said it's like oh it

286
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:05,430
some read it to me since the same as it

287
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,199
always been if you have any ideas on how

288
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,689
to improve it by all means but just

289
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:12,029
complaining it's just stupid to me I've

290
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:13,680
seen this happen so many times that to

291
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:18,899
know when it doesn't mean anything

292
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,720
all right so small PP that's so cool

293
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:26,939
know this so Bridget has gone to guys

294
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:29,069
can't you tell that's not I feel like I

295
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:31,290
should this should be could you make me

296
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:32,999
like an animation of this without the

297
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,309
background so I can use it in my videos

298
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:36,660
mr. Finn Bo because everyone else does

299
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:38,699
that so I feel like I have to do that

300
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,559
now sighs can you edit this in so this

301
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:45,689
is in the video so to remind people to

302
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:48,540

probably my least favorite type of humor

312
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,329
when someone says something that doesn't

313
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:19,980
really make sense and then you're like

314
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:22,589

was that the meme of 87 was that the

333
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,180
approach of 87 the only boomers we can

334
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,380

before where I said if you meet me say

345
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,530
this and then someone met me and they're

346
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,950
like oh god I know I'm supposed to say

347
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:45,110
something but I forgot what it is and

348
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:48,170
