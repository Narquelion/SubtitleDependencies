29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,200
begging me to do another photoshop video

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,720
idea

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,479

something please bye there has been a

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
couple things

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
that have been bothering me that i

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,560
haven't seen anyone do

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,119
properly so i guess i will have to do

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
this

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,600
number one will smith genie looks like

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,720
trash

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
how can we make it better everyone hates

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,799
this genie

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,280
you know i'm not supposed to give my

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,960
opinion but i think it's kind of hot

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,640
this really looks like a bad just

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,640
face slapped on

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,399
like it just looks terrible you could

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,920
literally add any face on top of this so

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,960
easily

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,000
i think i think what gives it away

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,400
it's honestly this line here i don't

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,239
know if this is intentional but this

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,599
it's almost like you can it's almost

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,000
like you can see like

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,080
where they cut his face onto this 3d

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,640
model or however they did it i don't

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,480
know

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,120
or maybe that's just like a small

60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,200
mistake is it in the other shots

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,160
i guess this is the shape of his face

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:37,360
but i think

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:40,560
i'm just curious

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,560
10 out of 10 baby

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,239
oh that's great

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,840
it's kind of purpley decrease the noise

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,400
fix the light thing there we go

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,760
starting to look decent fix his limp

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,440
really quick

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,760
i don't know why i did this it's not

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,480
funny there's nothing to it i just

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,800
wanted to see if i could do it better

73
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,319
which i clearly can't because before it

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,519

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,199
the genie

107
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
who who's that felix

110
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,520
a lot of people have been talking about

111
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,840
how will smith looks like

112
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,680
blue shrek so i'm curious how

113
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,240
exactly does blue shrek

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,479
actually look like you know every single

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
day i just sit here and i use the pen

116
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,880
tool

117
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
to crop myself out

118
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,560
you know i'd like to think at least you

119
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,639
know i'm getting better at photoshop for

120
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,880
doing these god awful thumbnails every

121
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,880
day

122
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,560
when in reality

123
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,600
i'm just god at using the pen tool

124
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,000
that's all it's ever done for me first

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,919
of all we need to put

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,600
him in the right location to really

127
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,440
immerse ourselves

128
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,639
into the landscape jazz

129
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,800
that looks terrible

130
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,639
you know i can work with it is there a

131
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,759
better ver

132
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,240
yeah okay here we go okay i like this

133
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,160
one

134
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,440
i think this is the keeper now of course

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,639
we're gonna have to turn them green

136
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,000
which is probably one of the most

137
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
difficult things

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,160
you could ever possibly do all right

139
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,319
we're done

140
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:16,639
[Laughter]

141
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,840
what is the color of shrek though like

142
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,319
is he that's a

143
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,039
disgusting yellow isn't it now of course

144
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,600
the most

145
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,840
iconic part of strength the ears

146
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,759
everyone

147
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,680
it actually works that's the weirdest

148
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,360
part

149
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,039
did you guys know that will smith was

150
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,960

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,240
shrek but he said no

152
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,479
because he was going to play in wild

153
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,520
west instead

154
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,520

needs more work

157
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,120

158
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,880
