know how did we go from a cute little

9
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,399
fudge ball to this

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,809
why on God's earth does this exist and

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,610
why on God's earth

12
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,710
Isis exists and why oh god why if I

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,829
could remove anything from planet Earth

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,809
it would be the sonic totem sonic totem

15
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,210
please I can't live with this I cannot

16
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,879
live on the same planet I cannot share

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,250
the same planet with this when people

18
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,219
talked about the new Sonic movie you

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,470
know there was a tiny shred of hope

20
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,750
people thought the dream is real maybe

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,130
Vin Diesel is gonna act in it maybe it

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,840
could actually be good you know maybe it

23
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,090
could be good maybe I could actually be

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,479
good people had all kinds of crazy ideas

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:20,070
the fantasies went wild but as you all

26
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:23,930
know sonic fantasies they released the

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,930
teaser and people were excited

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,020
well what people don't understand is

29
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:40,510
that Sonic has suffered too long

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,000
Sonic is already dead and there's

31
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:46,360
nothing that can bring him back at this

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,850
point but what makes his downfall so

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,090
painful is that he actually used to be

34
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,090
cool

35
00:01:52,410 --> 00:02:10,640
[Applause]

36
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,470
what people don't realize is that Sonic

37
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,260
retired long ago

38
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,410
he's living happy now these are all just

39
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,020
stunt doubles the thing is like even the

40
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,270
games have been bad for so goddamn long

41
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,160
and I know that anyone says who says

42
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,110
differently it's just purely out of

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,780
nostalgia or I am NOT gonna lie

44
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:33,220
the soundtrack fun Sonic R does make me

45
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,220
feel the sunshine okay

46
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,620
hey guys

47
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,969
[Music]

48
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,300
can you imagine a franchise recognized

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,520
by millions and millions and millions of

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:58,240
people that hasn't made a decent game in

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,550
what three decades I'm trying my best

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:30,700
gaza ming a little bit there I'm really

53
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:33,870
trying but I think what hurts the most

54
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,270
is that Sonic actually used to be cool

55
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,390
Sonic actually used to be somebody

56
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:42,490
goddammit

57
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:44,230
Sonic used to be the cool kid in town so

58
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,140
now that the trailer of the film is

59
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,510
finally out is anyone actually surprised

60
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:54,250
that this is the best they could come up

61
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:56,470
with it's a curse I am convinced it's a

62
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,720
curse at this point and you have to

63
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,900
understand that this comes from a place

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,760
of love I am the number one Sonic fan

65
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,700
okay maybe not that's impossible

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,580
has he not suffered enough isn't it time

67
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,270
to just exile Sonic and never speak of

68
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,459
him again

69
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,170
wouldn't that be better how much more do

70
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,709
you want to see this little Hedgehog in

71
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,690
pain

72
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,600
why aren't guards earth does he look

73
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,730
like the kid from human Jim mahadji you

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,580
know they spent multi million dollars on

75
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,160
this right you understand that for them

76
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,169
to then change it as they are now saying

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,030
Sonic the Hedgehog will be designed to

78
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,169
be changed following criticism you know

79
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,240
they're just gonna have to spend even

80
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:38,110
more multi millions and everyone going

81
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,210
oh it's a marketing strategy what if

82
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,070
paramount already have a good looking

83
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,500
sonic design and just showed us bad

84
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,900
version for marketing purposes see I

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,730
pulled a sneaky on you so many people

86
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,240
seem to share this sentiment you don't

87
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,120
understand no Sonic is cursed okay this

88
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,479
is the best they could do you had a

89
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:03,270
team of experts and the rest of frickin

90
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,160
Nicolas Cage literally put Nicolas Cage

91
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,070
in the Sonics if you know what put

92
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,570
Nicolas Cage and a blue spray can and I

93
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,720
will look like a better team sonic okay

94
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,430
ready

95
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,669
after knowing that they were the reason

96
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,100
behind the sonic remake unlimited power

97
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,930
now while God's earthly they listen to

98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,300
remake I know a lot of people are happy

99
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,340
about this saying like oh it's great you

100
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,979
know they're listening to criticism it's

101
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,350
too flippin late ok it's not gonna

102
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,240
change the build it's just gonna make

103
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,880
him look different it doesn't matter

104
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,370
okay it's just if they're already making

105
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,220
this incompetent decisions why am I on

106
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:47,280
ironically pissed off about this thing

107
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:50,940
I understand Sammy now I'm 30

108
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,490
god damn it Daniel the cooler Daniel I

109
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,039
guess people brought up the point of how

110
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,139
lil they have to change for Sonic to

111
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,970
look somewhat decent so I guess they

112
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,250
thought hey alright I guess we can just

113
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,380
change that but also from another

114
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,389
perspective at this point I just want to

115
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,599
see it for the memes that's all I really

116
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:11,970
care about even if your expectations are

117
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,669
completely destroyed and your hopes are

118
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,750
crushed you feel no excitement about

119
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,479
anything else in life

120
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,430
memes can cure that at least these are

121
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,380
three sonic designs made by three

122
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,389
different shoddy people you can't

123
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,530
convince the other one yeah what did it

124
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:30,780
look so different how did this happen

125
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:33,690
why do I care I don't care I look how

126
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:39,539
many blue animations are you gonna flip

127
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:42,539
up upgrade go back I said go back see it

128
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:45,389
shouldn't be so freakin hard man the

129
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,729
pupil can expand up to 55% when you look

130
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,199
at something you love

131
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:51,900

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,820

painful agonizing failure oh my god

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:06,080
guy from Team Fortress amazing we regret

137
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,419
to inform you that

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,280
he decided to let you go in favor of

139
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:14,900
someone better suited for the role of

140
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,330
Sonic I way cuter Sonic I know who made

paradise 12 years from now there will be

146
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,690
a live-action Sonic will be based on my

147
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:37,569
video this cannot be real I have to

148
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:47,180

change they make then I don't care it's

158
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,919
the only change they can make your Sonic

159
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,460
that is acceptable at least of my Sonic

160
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,460
standards

161
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:53,490
Wow see this looks really good - is that

162
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,560
true that actually happened

163
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,680
do they not test these things so they're

164
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,740
not like ask people being like a hidden

165
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,350
survey kind of thing hey so there's this

166
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,050
girl and basically why does he look like

167
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,890
that new CGI League wowie it looks

168
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,750
fantastic I love it

169
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,540
I'm getting a message live here from

170
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:19,700
meme review saying that the new improved

171
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,700
trailer has been leaked let's watch

172
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:39,130
[Music]

173
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:46,830
Jesus Christ I think I realized that

174
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,050
that Sonic is such a cultural phenomenon

175
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,110
at this point and how people perceive

176
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:54,330
him is so far away it's kind of like

177
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,510
YouTube in me when people who want and

178
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,970
what they put up are so different that

179
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,640
this is how war starts okay if they

180
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,250
embrace the meme okay if Sonic movie

181
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,630
kind of treats itself not so seriously I

182
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,160
think it could actually be pretty good

183
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,930
but of course they're not gonna do that

184
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,050
that's another acceptable character

185
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:15,870
design that I will let slide again with

loud and clear you aren't happy with the

204
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,200
design I wonder this makes me really

205
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,770
curious what they're gonna do

206
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,990
endgame or detective Pikachu sonic baby

207
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:14,050
founding boomstick why are they both

208
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,640
doing one at the same time surely that

209
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,050
can't be a coincidence right

210
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,780
Nintendo and Sega which has been

211
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,850
battling since the dawn of time releases

212
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,910
a live action of their biggest franchise

213
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,390
at the same time no no no I don't think

214
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,610

215
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:34,000

216
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:36,490

god Hollywood director says they'll fix

220
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,590
Sonic's design for the movie the movie

221
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,750
might lose me in potential a soul for a

222
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:52,840
soul I prefer the real style

223
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,490
