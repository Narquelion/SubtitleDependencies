guy said

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,559
they're high i knew you'd be here so i

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,199
made a fresh batch

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,920
and that's the most thoughtful anyone's

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,840
done for me

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,640
in a while this is the top voted of

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,080
all time a man literally just heated up

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,759
burritos for another man

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,400
cry god damn it it's funny when

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,439
when generally nice acts happen to

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,360
strangers

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,560

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,840

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,079
this world what

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,600
i play a lot of rocket league and uh

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,600
usually it's people telling you

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,759
but then i play this one game and my

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,119
teammate just left right away and the

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,320

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799

one

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,000
and then they took turns to play against

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,759
