79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,700
there forever anytime a creeper blow

80
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,260
something up anymore will pay this is a

81
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,000
message to all creepers watching this

82
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,060
video anyway I want to build an elevator

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think I know how to do it I just need

84
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,200
to do it and I will do it now thank you

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,970
that just will be pretty simple and

86
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:35,770
hopefully will work we'll see okay so

87
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:43,090
here we go there it is it if they should

88
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:45,990
do work you just play okay so I could

89
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,990
probably put the button closer

90
00:05:48,300 --> 00:06:00,670
okay did not work correctly Hey look at

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:03,850
that nice alright pretty cool the way it

92
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,430
works it's very simple this block pushes

93
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,840
up that activates the observer the

94
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,480
observer activates this block which

95
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,980
pushes this up rinse and repeat there's

96
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:17,610
probably like a million ways to do it

97
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:19,750
better but look at that all right so

98
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,390
let's just cover this up and we have a

99
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,250
fully working elevator okay so we have

100
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:28,780
one secret entrance here which is

101
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:34,590
obviously impossible to see and then we

102
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,590
have the elevator going right you know

103
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:42,029
and we're up look at that and then we

104
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:47,909
can make enchantment oh and I can jump

105
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:48,770
down for me actually oh nice look at

106
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:52,680
this

107
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:56,339
we went from burnt down house to epic

108
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,509
house of epic yeah where all the

109
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,469
chickens make more babies

110
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:07,050
beigey what do you have to say about

111
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:09,539
this okay all right cool oh they're all

112
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:14,039
in here ante oh my god come out little

113
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:19,409
children come out yes yes you're free

114
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:21,180
now you're free suffer eternally gosh I

115
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:24,469
wish you had machine guns cause like you

116
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:50,819
know terraria has oh my god it's so loud

117
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:55,309
she said it's so loud oh no I have to

118
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:59,459
stop this I will have to build the gun

119
00:07:55,309 --> 00:08:02,909
in Minecraft after row maybe that's what

120
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:07,199
I need to do to defend myself against

121
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:11,339
evil right I need to set up some sort of

122
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:15,120
defense so Outsider can't enter alright

123
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:18,809
let's build a gun in Minecraft oh I will

124
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,479
use cube hamster schematics on this I'm

125
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:26,729
not taking credit it is a really cool

126
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:28,819
way of building a a gun so the way this

127
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:32,000
works it's kind of confusing because

128
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:34,670
this will update this piston

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,140
by having something next to it and

130
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:40,410
that's the general gist of it because it

131
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,090
I think it moves quicker likewise if you

132
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,920
put this here thanks

133
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:46,400
so if that piston activates it will

134
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,380
activate this piston and we push this

135
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,800
and we'll have the same principle here

136
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:57,900
as here this whole series is just become

137
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:01,590
me building redstone I don't care okay

138
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:04,140
now we just need to connect this it

139
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,830
should work it should do Merrick oh god

140
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,990
it's scary

141
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:13,860
maybe I should test oh hey honey

142
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:26,580
okay I think it works now just need to

143
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:38,730
put that there and oh no oh no okay

144
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:43,710
alright back to building it that sucks I

145
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:46,800
have to okay all right I think the

146
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:50,090
forward the forward shot should work so

147
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,090
there you go look at that

148
00:09:53,070 --> 00:10:05,709
yeah maybe I should only do make it

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:10,540
forward shooting why is this so

150
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:16,480
satisfying oh no oh no abandon ship

151
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:21,970
abandon ship abandon all right so you

152
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:25,779
can't shoot infinitely fast noted okay

153
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:28,029
all right we know I'll just damn it why

154
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:30,520
does the upward not work I think I can

155
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:39,250
use it to launch myself as well it

156
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:40,149
should work now oh god let's try it yeah

157
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,680
it work

158
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:49,920
nice yes

159
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:52,470
we now have artillery to strike

160
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,990
[Music]

161
00:10:52,470 --> 00:11:01,720
and then one come near us you will pay

162
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:04,839
consequence it's so satisfying

163
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,080
oh shoot backwards so okay note to self

164
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:10,390
alright let's line up the chickens now

165
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,959
