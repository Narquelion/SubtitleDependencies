I thought a race was so weird like he

1850
03:16:29,810 --> 03:16:33,859
was the only one that had this power so

1851
03:16:32,090 --> 03:16:37,340
we could see the stories about this guy

1852
03:16:33,859 --> 03:16:41,180

cool

1950
03:27:56,220 --> 03:28:02,859
that's why samurais are so awesome it's

1951
03:27:58,899 --> 03:28:07,620
not just about killing obviously it's

1952
03:28:02,859 --> 03:28:07,620
epic but it's also about the softness

1953
03:28:13,560 --> 03:28:22,090
they can find like poems written in and

1954
03:28:19,840 --> 03:28:25,060
they were they were read there were

1955
03:28:22,090 --> 03:28:28,449
write poems before battle some people

1956
03:28:25,060 --> 03:28:30,460
would find them in if they passed away

1957
03:28:28,449 --> 03:28:33,040
they'll find it inside their head or not

1958
03:28:30,460 --> 03:28:35,109
ahead now what am I trying to say they

1959
03:28:33,040 --> 03:28:37,000
will leave the poems in there and helmet

1960
03:28:35,109 --> 03:28:39,189
some people find them so they had

1961
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:41,550
written this poem before battle that's

1962
03:28:39,189 --> 03:28:41,550
badass

1963
03:28:51,020 --> 03:28:59,930
and there's this general attitude that

1964
03:28:55,460 --> 03:29:01,789
you should spend as much time doing more

1965
03:28:59,930 --> 03:29:12,609
your things as you do

1966
03:29:01,789 --> 03:29:18,710
I guess calm things having that balance

1967
03:29:12,609 --> 03:29:24,430
that's what makes it interesting it's

1968
03:29:18,710 --> 03:29:24,430
cool it's cool samurais are cool say it

1969
03:29:32,380 --> 03:29:37,010
so yeah I read a sword and Kristen thiis

1970
03:29:35,510 --> 03:29:38,539
iam I keep forgetting how you say that

1971
03:29:37,010 --> 03:29:41,630
word but it was written by an

1972
03:29:38,539 --> 03:29:44,380
anthropologist American anthropologists

1973
03:29:41,630 --> 03:29:46,699
during World War two and her job was to

1974
03:29:44,380 --> 03:29:49,310
basically try and understand what would

1975
03:29:46,699 --> 03:29:53,689
happen if the Americans won the war and

1976
03:29:49,310 --> 03:29:56,689
how Japanese people would react I think

1977
03:29:53,689 --> 03:29:58,699
that that was the so she started

1978
03:29:56,689 --> 03:30:01,220
obviously as a foreigner and outside of

1979
03:29:58,699 --> 03:30:22,159
Japan so it's not very accurate but it's

1980
03:30:01,220 --> 03:30:24,520
still really interesting let's chill for

1981
03:30:22,159 --> 03:30:24,520
some dinner

1982
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:32,350
and they were they were explaining in

1983
03:30:30,220 --> 03:30:35,350
the book how the Japanese mindset was

1984
03:30:32,350 --> 03:30:38,710
was - during world war two was to fight

1985
03:30:35,350 --> 03:30:42,820
until the very last man or person able

1986
03:30:38,710 --> 03:30:49,180
to fight they have this dead-set mindset

1987
03:30:42,820 --> 03:30:52,630
to just keep fighting and then after the

1988
03:30:49,180 --> 03:30:54,760
war it was very strange for Americans to

1989
03:30:52,630 --> 03:30:57,580
be greeted by the Japanese and they were

1990
03:30:54,760 --> 03:31:00,880
greeted in such a positive and nice well

1991
03:30:57,580 --> 03:31:16,360
way going from being deadly as I am

1992
03:31:00,880 --> 03:31:19,560
talking about the dialogue I just had a

1993
03:31:16,360 --> 03:31:19,560
bath I'm good

1994
03:31:20,560 --> 03:31:26,140
and after the war even there were so

1995
03:31:23,230 --> 03:31:28,630
dead-set to fight up there until the

1996
03:31:26,140 --> 03:31:30,340
last man they completely changed and

1997
03:31:28,630 --> 03:31:31,600
Americans were so completely perplexed

1998
03:31:30,340 --> 03:31:34,200
by it the fact that they were so

1999
03:31:31,600 --> 03:31:36,460
welcoming to the American soldiers and

2000
03:31:34,200 --> 03:31:39,130
that's such a unique thing to the

2001
03:31:36,460 --> 03:31:40,720
Japanese of being able to change their

2002
03:31:39,130 --> 03:31:48,190
mindset and the reason behind that was

2003
03:31:40,720 --> 03:31:49,360
because of the orders of the Emperor as

2004
03:31:48,190 --> 03:31:52,270
far as I understand I don't know how

2005
03:31:49,360 --> 03:31:54,100
accurate that means but so first the

2006
03:31:52,270 --> 03:31:55,390
Emperor had ordered people to yeah we're

2007
03:31:54,100 --> 03:31:58,060
gonna fight until the last man and

2008
03:31:55,390 --> 03:32:00,070
people honored that obviously some

2009
03:31:58,060 --> 03:32:04,690
people were against it as well but and

2010
03:32:00,070 --> 03:32:07,020
then when the Emperor said okay now it's

2011
03:32:04,690 --> 03:32:09,400
time for peace people wanted to excel in

2012
03:32:07,020 --> 03:32:11,500
being peaceful and that's why the people

2013
03:32:09,400 --> 03:32:14,980
were all the sudden so welcoming to jump

2014
03:32:11,500 --> 03:32:19,020
to the Americans after the war because

2015
03:32:14,980 --> 03:32:19,020
they wanted to live up to the Emperor

2016
03:32:22,221 --> 03:32:31,130
it's interesting I think that's so

2017
03:32:25,170 --> 03:32:33,181
unique to Japan that mines 10

2018
03:32:31,130 --> 03:32:37,591
apparently back in the day they used to

2019
03:32:33,181 --> 03:32:39,540
have like obligations so you have

2020
03:32:37,591 --> 03:32:42,660
obligations to fulfill to your Emperor

2021
03:32:39,540 --> 03:32:44,311
and there's some or it's almost like

2022
03:32:42,660 --> 03:32:50,511
you're owed someone something and some

2023
03:32:44,311 --> 03:32:55,320
cannot never be repaid but some can and

2024
03:32:50,511 --> 03:32:59,700
they compared to stark circles to be

2025
03:32:55,320 --> 03:33:02,730
fulfilled I don't think it's really

2026
03:32:59,700 --> 03:33:04,681
accurate to say that but in general what

2027
03:33:02,730 --> 03:33:06,721
the book said at least is that Japanese

2028
03:33:04,681 --> 03:33:08,521
don't have it they don't look at good

2029
03:33:06,721 --> 03:33:12,240
and evil the same way as we're used to

2030
03:33:08,521 --> 03:33:15,150
with virtues it's rather how you your

2031
03:33:12,240 --> 03:33:22,830
actions are more based on the things

2032
03:33:15,150 --> 03:33:26,750
that you owe and how you fulfill them so

2033
03:33:22,830 --> 03:33:26,750
you owe your Emperor you own your family

2034
03:33:29,000 --> 03:33:34,530
and there's obligations that come to

2035
03:33:31,891 --> 03:33:40,431
that and then there's stories around

2036
03:33:34,530 --> 03:33:41,580
where samurai had to disobey their

2037
03:33:40,431 --> 03:33:43,561
obligations

2038
03:33:41,580 --> 03:33:46,670
I think it's called kink or something no

2039
03:33:43,561 --> 03:33:46,670
wait that's not it this bank

2040
03:33:53,180 --> 03:34:04,000
confront the impostor nice was I saying

2041
03:34:05,560 --> 03:34:10,729
with the what was called the story of

2042
03:34:07,939 --> 03:34:15,560
the 47 samurai or Ronin I'm sure you

2043
03:34:10,729 --> 03:34:17,210
heard about it it's so famous let's

2044
03:34:15,560 --> 03:34:22,790
confront this guy first and I'll talk

2045
03:34:17,210 --> 03:34:26,449
about it they made movies out of it I'm

2046
03:34:22,790 --> 03:34:30,529
sure people know about it whoa that

2047
03:34:26,449 --> 03:34:46,149
glitch did you see that that

2048
03:34:30,529 --> 03:34:46,149
[ __ ] anybody like him find him I

2049
03:34:49,359 --> 03:34:54,529
don't remember exactly what this story

2050
03:34:51,739 --> 03:34:58,100
was but it was that there were these 47

2051
03:34:54,529 --> 03:35:01,609
samurai and their leader was dishonored

2052
03:34:58,100 --> 03:35:05,779
so he killed someone that was part of

2053
03:35:01,609 --> 03:35:12,560
the not the Emperor but a Shogun or

2054
03:35:05,779 --> 03:35:17,120
whatever it's called [ __ ] I don't

2055
03:35:12,560 --> 03:35:19,910
remember so well read into it it was

2056
03:35:17,120 --> 03:35:25,489
good this was a the Keanu Reeves movie

2057
03:35:19,910 --> 03:35:27,410
was 47 Ronin no way but in the example

2058
03:35:25,489 --> 03:35:30,470
of it is that they were in this state

2059
03:35:27,410 --> 03:35:32,600
where they had to obviously avenge their

2060
03:35:30,470 --> 03:35:35,630
master which they owe him but they also

2061
03:35:32,600 --> 03:35:43,310
can't go against the Shogun wishes

2062
03:35:35,630 --> 03:35:45,260
against their moral code or whatever so

2063
03:35:43,310 --> 03:35:49,069
to avenge their master they they went

2064
03:35:45,260 --> 03:35:50,930
into so such extinct lengths to trying

2065
03:35:49,069 --> 03:35:52,310
to avenge him because it would be to

2066
03:35:50,930 --> 03:35:54,260
obviously if they just try and kill him

2067
03:35:52,310 --> 03:35:56,600
right away so a lot of them sold their

2068
03:35:54,260 --> 03:35:58,819
wives to pretend like they didn't care

2069
03:35:56,600 --> 03:36:01,550
about it and became degenerate and did

2070
03:35:58,819 --> 03:36:03,080
all these horrible things everywhere

2071
03:36:01,550 --> 03:36:05,210
they got exiled from their family just

2072
03:36:03,080 --> 03:36:06,290
to pretend like they didn't care about

2073
03:36:05,210 --> 03:36:08,510
getting

2074
03:36:06,290 --> 03:36:12,200
and then finally when the right time

2075
03:36:08,510 --> 03:36:14,440
came they obviously got it and but by

2076
03:36:12,200 --> 03:36:16,870
avenging their master they had

2077
03:36:14,440 --> 03:36:20,180
dishonored their fulfillment to the

2078
03:36:16,870 --> 03:36:24,290
Shogun or whatever it's called so that's

2079
03:36:20,180 --> 03:36:27,740
why afterwards they committed seppuku or

2080
03:36:24,290 --> 03:36:32,510
harakiri afterwards and it's used as an

2081
03:36:27,740 --> 03:36:34,640
example of sometimes those fulfillments

2082
03:36:32,510 --> 03:36:36,740
or whatever you have obligations are

2083
03:36:34,640 --> 03:36:43,521
collide with each other and it leads you

2084
03:36:36,740 --> 03:36:45,800
to do things that don't make sense

2085
03:36:43,521 --> 03:36:47,570
it's hard to understand that it's hard

2086
03:36:45,800 --> 03:36:53,000
to understand as a foreigner living in

2087
03:36:47,570 --> 03:36:56,840
such a different time these concepts

2088
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:58,250
that seem so insane that you would first

2089
03:36:56,840 --> 03:36:59,630
of all kill yourself with a sword

2090
03:36:58,250 --> 03:37:02,180
because of your master and all these

2091
03:36:59,630 --> 03:37:03,590
things you really think about it seems

2092
03:37:02,180 --> 03:37:06,680
like why I would never do that

2093
03:37:03,590 --> 03:37:09,790
what the [ __ ] such a different mindset

2094
03:37:06,680 --> 03:37:09,790
such a different way of living

2095
03:37:15,920 --> 03:37:24,710
I think I should end the livestream here
