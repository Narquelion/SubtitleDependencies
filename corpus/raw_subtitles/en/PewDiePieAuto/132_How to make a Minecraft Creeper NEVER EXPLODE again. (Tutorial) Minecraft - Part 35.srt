this series maybe if we we trap him

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,440
right look at him here I wonder if

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,180
there's an achievement for freaking a

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,060
creeper in this game if not I'm very

49
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,150

thought into anything so I'll put a okay

53
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,859

175
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,720

with a boat this is my tutorial you just

177
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:57,270
build a line for five squares make it

178
00:11:52,350 --> 00:12:00,690
even you get a you got a boat actually

179
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:04,680
needs to be eight right yeah this will

180
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:07,740
be where the piston will be so you'll

181
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,570
want to put the water flowing towards

182
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,490
there so in this corner for example you

183
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:15,420
see it's gonna be pushed towards there

184
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:18,480
so that there can be no avoidance of of

185
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,370
any penetrate this is just a method I

186
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,650
use other people probably have other

187
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,630
ideas and and ways to do it and

188
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,880
