200
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:20,550
when you open a room in area 51 and find

201
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:23,129
one of the boys who went missing oh this

202
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,040
is so dice the US Air Force has also

203
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:27,750

they're trying to bargain with us

205
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,889
but don't listen no matter what tricks

206
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:33,809

208
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,649
