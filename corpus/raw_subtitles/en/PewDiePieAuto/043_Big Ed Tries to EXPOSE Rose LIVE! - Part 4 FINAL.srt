00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,670
I would argue nothing in common I would

193
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,140
say that I think this but then again you

194
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,070
don't have to have things in common for

195
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,570

you that's how she talked the whole time

234
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:24,350
but okay do you did you have true

235
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:26,029
feelings for him yes I believe her

236
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,669
because to be honest from from what I've

237
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:30,669
seen it mean it didn't really seem like

238
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:57,049
don't get a tone with me

239
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,600
someone just snapped I guess she doesn't

240
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:03,709
know what she said right away okay I can

241
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,129
tell Rose is very upset I'd like for the

242
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:08,850
translator to tell me what Rose is upset

243
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:11,399
about okay

244
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,129
Rose is saying that she feels that it

245
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,739
doesn't see or appreciate all the effort

246
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:20,009
that she did for for the relationship

247
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:23,100
and that what effort but Rose is playing

248
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:25,619
that is lying and trying to hide the

249
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,749
fact that he wasn't really a good person

250
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:28,529
to her but what about almost all the

251
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:32,429
secrets

252
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:35,759
what about all des secrets and maybe his

253
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:37,289
height which I'm not quite sure how how

254
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,889
you can't hide that considering you guys

255
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:42,600
would video chat and Skype but yeah it's

256
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:45,389
impossible to not see someone's height

257
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:49,499
from a video because I am actually 6

258
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:51,869
feet tall as you all know 611 actually

259
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:54,479
as you can tell because I am on camera

260
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:56,039
right now you can tell my height there's

261
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:59,850
no way for me to hide my height from you

262
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:02,039
guys because I'm on the simple things

263
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,720
that you should be honest about as far

264
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:31,049
as past relationships especially when

265
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:32,759
you're wanting him to call him what what

266
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:37,589
was he saying that she really doesn't

267
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:40,139
care about this oh my god and actually

268
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:42,809
asked her to go on video calls on

269
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:46,399
multiple times and even acceptable on

270
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:46,399
sex did you follow with him

271
00:14:47,459 --> 00:15:01,180

274
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,089

what about them

276
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,990

277
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,269
they happen right if in a relationship

278
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,680
using that kind of stuff but I don't

279
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:15,070

you I love you I love you so first of

317
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:19,220
all I don't think I was wrong in asking

318
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,579
alright it's the same answer I don't

319
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,480
care when you were asking rose to shave

320
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,290
her legs

321
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:30,890
I love the daughter frenching I

322
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:33,799
apologize for asking you to shave your

323
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:36,890
legs but let me explain women in

324
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,210
California they laser their legs so I

325
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,660
don't know how I feel about this it's

326
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:43,429
obviously very rude and presumptuous

327
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,350
that a woman should just change the way

328
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,090
you prefer them but I feel like in a

329
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,850
relationship if you like certain things

330
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,850
about another person I think you have

331
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:56,240
the right to it ask and I expect them to

332
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,580
ask me to do the same kind of thing

333
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,780
right I wouldn't demand it and I

334
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,850
wouldn't be angry if they didn't want to

335
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,799
do it I don't have this kind of probably

336
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,260
my dad okay cuz she's perfect

337
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:08,120
but I don't think is that crazy I think

338
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:11,210
it's all the things stacked up though he

339
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,740
has for this D test yes for shaving

340
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,600
likes your breast things and all this

341
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,059
stuff it's all came on once at a time

342
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,260
and it just comes off more as all you

343
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,900
need to change if you're gonna be with

344
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,880
me kinda that's not cool obviously we

345
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,110
understand what I'm making here they

346
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,850
argument okay cool

347
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:29,780
it was something that I wasn't familiar

348
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:33,590
with but I apologize I apologize I did

349
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,940

350
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:38,900

351
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,580
weird but I apologize if I hurt you for

352
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,940

353
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,940
intention

355
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:04,170

ability I made a fool out of myself huh

understand what she's talking about

365
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,360
she's Olli they needs to feel real it's

366
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,890
an eye on you and she's queen I

367
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,300
understand she's standing up for Rosa

368
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,220
but what the [ __ ] is she saying this is

369
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,390
not an argument I feel like no woman was

370
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,610
ever good enough for big yet he always

371
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:44,010
has to find something wrong with him and

372
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,450
also like right after they met he put

373
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:51,720
all these things on her too that is

374
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:53,370
definitely not help either where do you

375
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,780
come from you're not part of the council

376
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,500
I understand that I know but I have

377
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,660
trust issues

378
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,520
she wasn't being honest with me I had

379
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:07,560
the right to ask and she has trust

380
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:10,200
issues that's ironic why don't you tell

381
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:17,670
her before you enter that you know what

382
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:18,840
kids yes yes yes it's wrong raising kids

383
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,250
in America's you know you have two

384
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:36,630
beautiful daughters they're expensive

385
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:38,940
they cost money do you feel as though

386
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,460
like throughout your life you've had a

387
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,590
problem with relying information

388
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,570
correctly of course I have I'm not

389
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,810
saying it's right I'm not saying I'm

390
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:52,080
perfect but another council member

391
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:55,170
speech are you gonna tell me that you

392
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,120
genuinely love rose yes I did love her

393
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,920
why is rose saying that you used her

394
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:05,820
that's what I want to know that's your

395
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:07,140
prerogative yeah definitely not think

396
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,000
this whole thing would blow up in his

397
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,920
face it seems like oh I'm meeting this

398
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,540
girl I might owe and I get to get famous

399
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,400
in the process I don't think it was like

400
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,070
going in into one of these things

401
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,700
completely he was thinking he could get

402
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,559
all of it

403
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,409
I can get famous so I can get this oh

404
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:27,990
wait people realize I have a really ugly

405
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:29,519
personality I like to believe that

406
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,750
people can change because otherwise

407
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,610
what's the point we're just gonna tear

408
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,950
each other down constantly over and over

409
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,620
and over again even though maybe my

410
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,510
hopes are not so high for it but who

411
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,840
knows what will happen in the future

412
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,470
another episode but I believe for once

413
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,690
and for all

414
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,880
