terrorize my villagers yes I have this

71
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,560
new system set up which I think you guys

72
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,520

73
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,970
guarding them to make sure good jobs win

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:07,790
so I have a I have a very well-hidden do

75
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,640
what is it absorber here which if you

76
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,530
can see there's a line of thread here so

77
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,070
if anyone passes this thread observer

78
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,169
will notice and the trap will activate

79
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:22,540
now so far not a single soul has managed

80
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:26,000
to escape this prison right Sven yes

81
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,820
but just for a safety mesh no the boat

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,570
is not for you Sven you want to be the

83
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,040
guard boat fine okay fine

84
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,200
all right let's remove this and let's

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:47,750
watch them walk into the trap you're

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:51,380

90
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,669
only need one right now let's actually

91
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:07,669
feed them a bit more I need more babies

92
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:09,860
keep eating and keep fricken oh it's

93
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:11,780
working excellent I have to cover up the

94
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,690
whole thing because babies can still

95
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,280
crawl in through tiny holes

96
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,610
which is kind of an oceans and I haven't

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:24,440
made this with babies and oh well how do

98
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:27,199
you do okay this is perfect so this is

99
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,130
my new transportation system oh yeah I

100
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,650
showed her already

101
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:34,819
well the reason you featured to it you

102
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:37,310
see the track doesn't go up now I put

103
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:42,530
the track over here and then it will go

104
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:46,160
up up into there was that which so oh my

105
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,870
God where huh in my spawner so I

106
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,620
improved my spawner based on one of you

107
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,360
9 rolls oh it works I'm supposed to me I

108
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,120
made it one by one but it's better if

109
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,070
you make it 2 by 2 so now you can see my

110
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,820
training is a little broken I get the XP

111
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:05,449
bang bang BAM it's full and the loot

112
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,159

115
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:13,759

116
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:19,490
