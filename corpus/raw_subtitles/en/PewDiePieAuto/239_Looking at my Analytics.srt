little bit into Google Trends but I want

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,710
to really dig deeper

13
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,410

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,370
so funny he's so good alright let's just

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,350
go into this so here we get an interest

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,390
overtime grant pretty interesting I

25
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,920
would say you know it's it's there you

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,650
don't really get the full picture unless

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,229
you hit the whole graph so let's start

28
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,030
up here in 2012 this is where I'm nice I

29
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,350
guess I started becoming more popular

30
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:24,659
I'm not exactly sure what they represent

31
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:28,610
what but I hit my peak at 2014 what

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,290
happened in 2014 I need to understand so

33
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:36,860
someone made a playlist I guess I played

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:40,880
games in 2014 no controversy no nothing

35
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:43,890
huh I'm actually in the same room

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,780
nothing's changed five years Jesus

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,200
Christ when did I become the biggest

38
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,290
channel in 2013 damn it's been a long

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,110
time it's 2013 and then I I peaked in

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,210
2014 and then it all just it all just

41
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,600
went down I think it's interesting to

42
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,790
note at least for me cuz anyone that

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,399
came before me almost every single

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,680
channel that has been before me has is

45
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,450
disappeared okay everyone that's been

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,310
bigger than me they've all they're all

47
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,260
gone because of this fact I've always

48
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,680
just looked at YouTube like it could end

49
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,540
at end

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,040
like I should just be ready to pack my

51
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,989
dad bags out any day

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,700
I actually oh wait let me see if I can

53
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,680
find that sorry I'm this is video is

54
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,310
just gonna be one giant engine so I did

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,469
a I think in 2012 I did a I did a

56
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,540
presentation do not google it for the

57
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:35,760
love of God but I I found the pictures

58
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,799
and I talked about you know doing Let's

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,230
Plays as a job people didn't really know

60
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:42,389
anything about it at the time look here

61
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,299
I'm showing off my stats being like hey

62
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:47,069
guys it's going pretty well

63
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:49,049
there was one information that I I was

64
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,299
really interested by sick of boring

65
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:53,519
Let's Plays I am you're salivate er I

66
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:57,000
found the presentation where is it

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,040
beautiful faces of horror okay so how

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,329
did I get to where I am full time job to

69
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,040
videos every day do something different

70
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,750
let myself into the game blocks so what

71
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,819
happens in the future I thought it was

72
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,459
interesting how I kind of questioned how

73
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,560
it was something stable or not with laws

74
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,069
and regulations and copyright I thought

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,319
these things would hit quicker I really

76
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,000
I was so unsure whether he would even be

77
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,949
allowed to monetize the gameplay on

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,329
YouTube I think it's it's one of those

79
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,879
things where people really fought for

80
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,430
and to try and convince companies as

81
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,769
well that it's benefit fitting for them

82
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,260
like these big cup publishers like EA

83
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,549
but that's that whatever they benefit

84
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,500
from people playing their game and they

85
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:39,209
them understanding that has really had a

86
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,310
huge impact on on YouTube and gaming I

87
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,379
can easily see it go in another way

88
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,479
where gaming would just not be allowed

89
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,790
on YouTube and I that's always been in

90
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,159
the back of my head you know and now in

91
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,720
the future 2019 nothing's really changed

92
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,939
its article 13 all these stuffs

93
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,400
happening I think this is where wall

94
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,109
street journal' happened I think it

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,430
happened in February because it was

96
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,319
literally on Valentine's Day

97
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,079
it was here so this is a Wall Street

98
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,780
Journal and then Barbara Babbitt above

99
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,819

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,770
that's what it is and then the third

142
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,610
most related is my net worth

201
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:14,829
give up goddammit

202
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:17,109
subscribe god damn it I need a hundred

203
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:19,269
million there's another website that

204
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:22,600
lets you look at statistics and

205
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:25,359
analytics of course socialblade I used

206
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,249
to be obsessed with social Blaine and I

207
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:29,079
think a lot of youtubers are a lot of

208
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:31,299
youtubers go on social blade and they

209
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:33,100
look at their own stats and they compare

210
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:35,319
it to other people and they they

211
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,889
frantically I think that makes a lot of

212
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:40,779
people really really depressed why my

213
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:43,479
lack Finke what's wrong with me

214
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,879
it's just that imagine that you have a

215
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:50,529
job and how well you are performing in

216
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:53,589
that job is 100% public and 100%

217
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:55,499
comparable to all your peers like

218
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,509
there's some deep psychological

219
00:09:55,499 --> 00:10:00,519
emotional stress that is always

220
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:02,919
lingering for a lot of youtubers I

221
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,289
literally have not gone on social blade

222
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,579
in like four years I just stopped I

223
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:09,129
don't know why what happened

224
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:11,709
after a while it just luckily it just

225
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:13,869
ironically it hit me it doesn't matter

226
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:15,999
like I don't care how many subscribers I

227
00:10:13,869 --> 00:10:17,859
have it doesn't matter and I don't have

228
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:20,169
to waste time just obsessing about this

229
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:21,759
stuff but I do remember I used to obsess

230
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:23,559
about this stuff and I think a lot of

231
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,909
youtubers do especially comparing

232
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:34,389
themselves so my views are up yay my

233
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:37,689
subscribers are doing estimated monthly

234
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:39,879
earnings it seems about right I used to

235
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:41,470
complain so much when I saw these

236
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,939
estimated monthly earnings but like

237
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,799
that's ridiculous

238
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:47,379
how can I possibly make that much money

239
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,929
and then clearly I have been very poorly

240
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:52,089
monetizing my channel like before I

241
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:54,069
would make 4-minute videos you barely

242
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:55,959
make any money on those like that's

243
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:58,359
impossible how can everyone make so much

244
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,999
money oh oh I'm not monetizing my

245
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:04,149
channel oh okay cool well maybe that's a

246
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:07,809
part of the reason 21 billion views

247
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:10,269
that's nuts dude okay so what I

248
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:11,279
really want to investigate here is the

249
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,259
top

250
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,470
subscribers who's gaining the most

251
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,209
subscribers right now okay 300,000 in a

252
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:22,499
day Jesus Christ

253
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:24,209
knowledge TV teach me clearly I need to

254
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:27,089
become Indian I'm beginning to see a

255
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:29,040
pattern here okay well that was

256
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:31,470
analytics with PDP I hope you guys

257
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,079
thought this was interesting I've

258
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,420
literally uploaded every single day for

259
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,600
as long as I can remember taking minimum

260
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,360
breaks as much as I can possibly take

261
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,769
take it's crazy to me how I still enjoy

262
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,930
it I don't get it either

263
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,240
why am I here it's fun I don't know what

264
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,490
to tell you one thing that I am thinking

265
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,800
about is like I've never had a proper

266
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,600
break like I never had a long break

267
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,249
where I'm just a normal person

268
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,439
that isn't constantly thinking about

269
00:11:56,249 --> 00:12:00,629
YouTube but literally if I took a break

270
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:03,180
it would kill my channel the way YouTube

271
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:04,579
is shaped at this point it's like you

272
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,199
just have to keep making videos

273
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:08,730
otherwise there won't be anything to

274
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,589
come back to we've seen this happen

275
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,959
through so many youtubers they go on a

276
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:15,629
break and then hey guys what's up Oh

277
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,850
everyone is gone oh no didn't light and

278
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:19,680
leave the algorithm made it so you know

279
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,480

280
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,639
the back of your mind bring youtuber

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,439
