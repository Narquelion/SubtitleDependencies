1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,560
how's it goin browse it is me my voice

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:13,500
is completely ruined

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:15,210
ah so I thought if there's ever gonna be

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,150
a perfect time for me to do an update

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,039
blog it is now because it's gonna be

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,369
chill it's just gonna be a nice little

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,220
sit-down and I honestly I am way overdue

8
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,170
to make one of these obviously I don't

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,279
know if you noticed this but the channel

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,800
has undergone some changes lately anyone

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,300
picked up on it but not just that but I

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,340
personally have undergone some changes

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,100
lately as well and I haven't really

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,800
addressed any of it in a video because

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,899
I've been too busy playing Minecraft so

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:54,120
I thought now would be the perfect time

17
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:57,870
minecraft minecraft has completely taken

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,210
over and I gotta say I absolutely love

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,190
it and it's just been so fun there's

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,899
just been so much positivity with the

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,510
channel and all the content and people

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,100
just wanting more videos and feeling

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,770
like oh I was such a good episode I

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,960
really enjoyed that that for me has been

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,960
so fun to follow and to hear from you

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,250
guys you know when you make youtube

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,770
videos or at least gaming videos and and

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,560
frequently at that sometimes you hit

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,170
certain things that maybe get really

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,360
popular but maybe you don't enjoy making

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,880
it yourself or maybe some things that

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,920
you really enjoy recording doesn't get

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,900
very popular for whatever reason or

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,450
maybe people don't like yet because it

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,759
doesn't translate as well too into video

36
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,590
format so it's almost like you have

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,090
these different you have these things

38
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,850
that you want to hit as a youtuber but

39
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,619
and sometimes you hit one or two of them

40
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,869
but with Minecraft it's just been

41
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,520
everything this has been all positive

42
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,409
but the channel is getting more abuse

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,390
than has ever gone everyone seemed

44
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,210
really happy and positive about it

45
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,149
I absolutely loved recording it and ad

46
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,119
revenue is absolutely fantastic like it

47
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,530
could not be better I know some people

48
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,479
are saying oh he's only playing

49
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,160
minecraft you guys see now he's getting

50
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,850
ads

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,710
no I would have done it anyway but it is

52
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,360
epic I'm not gonna lie I feel like I'm

53
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:22,070
finally earning what people think I'm

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,360
making out of YouTube videos merch is

55
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,100
still the best way to support the

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,160
channel thank you okay

57
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,060
it is funny looking back as well because

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,760
I did a podcast with cold ones like a

59
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,280
month ago or before minecraft took off

60
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,170
and we were talking about like oh what's

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,810
the next thing gonna be like wonder well

62
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,920
the next is gonna be yes I think people

63
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,110
are getting tired of those type of

64
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,820
videos yeah well it's hard to say

65
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,520
because no one wants to be the guy that

66
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,500
makes the everyone wants to be the

67
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,580
[ __ ] follower of that let's just wait

68
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,850
you should do what everyone else does

69
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,770
YouTube resolve is changing so quickly

70
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,780
it's pretty crazy but whenever my

71
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,060
channel gets like a second wind like

72
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,160
this for the hundredth time at this

73
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,740
point it feels like I'm always so

74
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,280
grateful it just feels amazing and

75
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,830
honestly like I can't believe I'm I

76
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,780
think I'm this year is my tenth year as

77
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,230
a youtuber uploading every single day

78
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,470
and to still be on top of what I do is

79
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,960
just unbelievable especially looking

80
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,450
back at other youtubers at the time you

81
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,990
know the longevity of youtubers was so

82
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,370
short

83
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,200
I always thought like oh I could

84
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,780
probably do it for like another year and

85
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,460
then people won't care so there's still

86
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,200
be able to make videos that I feel

87
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,610
really good about and then our audience

88
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,750
really like as well it's pretty crazy

89
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:44,360
when I started off youtube I made videos

90
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,280
for like a whole year and no one really

91
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,630
watched it I'm sure you've seen some of

92
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,209
my older videos youtube like to

93
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:55,310
recommend them very specifically like my

94
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:57,530
hundred subs special or whatever and

95
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:02,110
yeah today we're gonna celebrate because

96
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,110
I got 100 subscribers oh my

97
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,920
but once I started playing amnesia which

98
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,350
was the thing that really took off for

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,960
my channel because I played this horror

100
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:17,820
game and I was giving these little

101
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:21,750
objects in the game names never Stefano

102
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,820
there was barrels which was even I mean

103
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:28,110
it's the same cause as I'm doing now

104
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:32,700
that I think about it but it was like a

105
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:36,870
very endearing time for my memory and my

106
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,790
heart at that time and you know that's

107
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,260
what I really fell in love with YouTube

108
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,120
doing that stuff and that's when I

109
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,010
decided I'm gonna pursue being a

110
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,800
youtuber because this is amazing and

111
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,780
then you know it kind of went down a lot

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,390
after a while after a few years people

113
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,320
kind of got bored of scary games and so

114
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:57,810
did I so that was a very stressful

115
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,000
period when you're trying to transition

116
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,700
into something else as a youtuber so to

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,960
be here again doing the same thing like

118
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:10,230
with Minecraft having that moment that I

119
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,750
had when I started off I never thought I

120
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:15,480
would relive that ever I never thought I

121
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,580
would experience that again and I'm so

122
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,980
happy that I get to do that with mine

123
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,410
crime and I feel like such a douche bag

124
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,170
or like peeing on this game would be

125
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,570
like no it's too popular I don't want to

126
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:30,030
play it and then Here I am like oh it's

127
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,740
actually good but also looking back I

128
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,710
feel like now was the perfect time for

129
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,410
me to play it you know it's not just

130
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,960
about the game it's also the timing I

131
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,330
think at least it feels like I've come

132
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,490
to a full circle with a channel now

133
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,940
coming back to gaming this way and

134
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:53,130
looking back you know it's been a rocky

135
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:55,380
road and I think that's almost why a lot

136
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,140
of people appreciate the channel at this

137
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,820
point and I appreciate everyone sticking

138
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,400
through with me throughout like all the

139
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,620
controversies and and all that stuff and

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,980
obviously looking back now I kind of

141
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,220
feel like

142
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:13,030
very stupid about it and how a lot of it

143
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,330
just wasn't worth it so basically I'm

144
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:20,160
sorry for all the bad things I've done I

145
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,160
just want to play minecraft please I

146
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,670
guess I just realized it's like this is

147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,430
why I started making videos it's what I

148
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,810
enjoy doing obviously I'm not gonna be

149
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,160
able to be minecraft forever there's

150
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:34,810
always gonna be the next thing or

151
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,150
whatever but then again if I stop

152
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,690
playing minecraft then my pit

153
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,870
sven is gonna be alone and I can't let

154
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,480
that happen

155
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,480
another big change in for the channel

156
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,130
has been Brad who's been editing for for

157
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,260
those who don't know I used to have two

158
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,780
editors Brad and Syme so I was still

159
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,660
working with me but Brad left to do his

160
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,790
own thing Brad and I have been working

161
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,290
together for five years and we made a

162
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,430
lot of really amazing videos that I'm

163
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,430
really really proud of

164
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,229
you're wearing a life jacket beats Mouse

165
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,470
264 should I be wearing a life jacket oh

166
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,470
absolutely

167
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,100
ever man

168
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,820
get it and make it

169
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,430
I see swallowed him so now it's just me

170
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,500
and and sighs and I was looking for a

171
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,170
new editor right away but in the

172
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,000
meanwhile I was editing my own Minecraft

173
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,130
episodes and for those of you don't know

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,470
for five for the first five years of me

175
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:48,620
making videos I was editing every single

176
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,420
day and as tedious that can be n s

177
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,790
tedious and time-consuming that can be

178
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,800
it's also something I've missed for a

179
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:58,760
while and I realized while editing the

180
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,710
Minecraft videos that I actually really

181
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,370
enjoy editing those and I can tell that

182
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:07,010
you guys enjoy it as well because

183
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:11,480
instead of just trying to record the

184
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:13,970
video and just get it up because

185
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,520
tomorrow we have another video so it

186
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,680
doesn't matter you know that's kind of

187
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,570
the attitude we had to keep with the

188
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,690
frequency of the uploads on this channel

189
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,220
and considering most of the time it's

190
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,940
two people involved to get the video

191
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,160
down instead when when I get to edit it

192
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,750
I can sort of shape it in a way that

193
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,640
makes more sense than I can really make

194
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,940
it exactly how I want it and I can put

195
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,030
that little extra effort in which a lot

196
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,349
of times I've seen is unnecessary but

197
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,480
it's been really fun to do that and

198
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:47,090
there's a lot of Minecraft episodes now

199
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,810
that I always sounds crunchy but I

200
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:54,860
generally feel very proud of like the

201
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:58,790
the whether episode and you get all that

202
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,160
stupid stuff I love that I think it's so

203
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,050
fun to make that stuff and I'm very very

204
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,370
happy with that it's been a while since

205
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,620
I've been able to say like oh I feel

206
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,180
really proud of this video so that feels

207
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,010
really good as well you know they said

208
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,110
what I said I feel like I'm naturally

209
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,940
coming back to where I started with this

210
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,640
channel and I enjoy it

211
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,580
I really did another thing is that I'm

212
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,070
getting married soon right yeah I can't

213
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,290
wait to be your husband I'm very excited

214
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,240
but it's also been a lot of work and

215
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,180
then to also edit my own videos it's

216
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,610
been hard to keep up so there's no I'm

217
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,070
trying my best with the time that I have

218
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,560
each day for anyone that's a youtuber

219
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,420
that you know it's a grind and for a lot

220
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,490
of other businesses whenever you start

221
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,800
something and

222
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,920
reach a level of success you can kind of

223
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,290
like slow down a bit and let other

224
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,959
people take over the work but to still

225
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,699
have me here to like doing all that it's

226
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,679
kind of crazy if you think about it but

227
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:56,139
at the same time this is what I enjoy

228
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,699
doing this is what I want to do so I'm

229
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:59,350
actually just happy about it I think

230
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:00,970
it's fun the final thing I wanted to

231
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,449
address now is that you know I'm getting

232
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,029
married

233
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:06,160
brides left get hitting a hundred

234
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,660
million subscribers did use an insane

235
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,660
number it's the dumbest number I ever

236
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,939
heard but I still have believe it

237
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,619
like before YouTube I was that weird kid

238
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:17,199
with no friends and then all the sudden

239
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:19,899
there's so many people that enjoy what I

240
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,699
do it's pretty insane to me I like I

241
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,559
still can't wrap my head around it

242
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:26,559
honestly thank you everyone for

243
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:29,230
subscribing whether your been here since

244
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,879
the beginning or on and off or for a

245
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,319
little while I really appreciate

246
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:37,179
everyone immune I there's been a lot of

247
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:39,399
speculation that I'm gonna quit the

248
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:41,980
channel because first of all these

249
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,499
pieces kind of falling together I still

250
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,230
really enjoy YouTube and I'd have no

251
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:48,610
plans of quitting I do think it would be

252
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,579
good for me to take a break at some

253
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:55,929
point just to feel what it's like to

254
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:57,429
have a break okay I don't take breaks I

255
00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:00,279
just keep going and going and going

256
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:03,339
because I'm so in the routine of making

257
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,619
videos but it would be nice to just not

258
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:08,410
have YouTube in my brain for the first

259
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:10,389
time in ten years I'll probably do that

260
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,980
at some point in the future at least but

261
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:15,069
I just wanted to address the whole he's

262
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,889
gonna quit thing other than that I just

263
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:20,439
want to say I'm really happy um you guys

264
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:22,929
seem happy as well and that just feels

265
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:25,029
really good and I think that's the

266
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:27,850
bottom line is that I just really enjoy

267
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,040
making uplifting content and it was good

268
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,379
to do that so thank you everyone for

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,939
