oh that's so cute found this on

220
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,880
pinterest

221
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,279
pinterest it's disgusting

222
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,200
pinterest more like a cringe arrest

223
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,760
everyone cybers are simple cyber is a

224
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
sim

225
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,519
say that i could just edit everyone out

226
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,560
of the video are you really in charge

227
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,839

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,480
you think you can call me let's see

229
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,480
how dare you

230
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,320
no you know what that actually makes a

231
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,279
lot of sense because if saiv actually

232
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
was a sim

233
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,160
he would try and hide the fact that he

234
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,959
was the same like we were talking about

235
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,519
before

236
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,800
so he would edit out all the sip memes

237
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,080
but the fact that sai

238
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,800
puts the sip memes of him being a simp

239
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,320
n is actually kind of a chad move save

240
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,959

252
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,720
when youtube realizes they still have to

253
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,800
make the rewind for this year

254
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:33,839

apparently

259
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,959
so i have the thousand zero one and

260
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,920
someone else has the zero one that's

261
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,839
illegal

262
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,440
how did this happen probably just a

263
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,120
photo of one of the people that worked

264
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,000

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,920
to them shipping the toy and the pick

267
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,880
was probably made for advertisers

268
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,240
purposes

269
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,320

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,760
americans trying to figure out what

335
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,360
month 19 is what's up

336
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,880
why would you start on the month it

337
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,120
makes no sense

338
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,480
honestly i think it's time america just

339
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
stops with it

340
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,920
with their date system the way you order

341
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,000
it and your

342
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,839
uh whatever metric system you're using

343
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,320
just stuff with your fahrenheit all

344
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,040
right it

345
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
makes no sense to use fahrenheit we all

346
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,160
know

347
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,959
it doesn't make any sense just stop from

348
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,680
now on

349
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,120
if you are caught saying fahrenheit uh

350
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,279
what should the punishment be

351
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,320
like uh we need some sort of punishment

352
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,040
to make people stop

353
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,639
shoot them that's right okay how about

354
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,639
that all right maybe that's about

355
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
you see a meme that uses fahrenheit

356
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,040
download it this is how we make a

357
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,800
difference

358
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,079
