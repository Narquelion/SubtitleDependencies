says it enough we know your name is

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,850
Karen stop questioning in it stop trying

18
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,280
to make us doubt it you're just

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,710
confusing after a long day of talking to

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,390
managers and driving her kids around she

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,299
sits down with her mom friends at the

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,820
book club and drinks lots and lots of

23
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,400
wine we talk about 50 shades of grey

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,229
Karen took the kids guys Karen took the

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,360
kids when you spend so much time making

26
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,970
Karen took the kids means that your wife

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,320
actually leaves and takes your kids just

28
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:27,990
like this why Karen why did you have to

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:31,140
take the case so this Karen Mimas going

30
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,090
on a long time on the Internet but what

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,640
makes it so funny is when people try and

32
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,460
silence a meme because that just makes

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,930
it ten times over more effective it's

34
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,159
just like the Burma means that was

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,320
around for a long time and it wasn't

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,399
until people said hey you shouldn't say

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,530
boomer because he hurts our pitch it's

38
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,780
now it's the same with Karen and it's

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,899
got their beautiful dear Millennials ok

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,579

41
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:59,219
stop saying Karen even though I'm boomer

42
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,500
karen is a sexist thanks for

43
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,990

you like lighting certain words Garrett

46
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,190
is a sexist and racist term equivalent

47
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,560
to the

48
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:22,740

women super it gets better and better to

53
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,830
stand up for themselves

54
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,500

inside to talk to the manager during a

149
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,190
pandemic this is so sad

150
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,900
karen has lost all their power what

151
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,279
Karen does now is she takes photos of

152
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,900
people from the outside

153
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,979
she's got camera equipment that is

154
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:59,169
better than any paparazzi 5,000 zoom if

155
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,159
she catches you outside she's reporting

156
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,379
that that's Karen

157
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:04,360
you shouldn't go outside by the way I'd

158
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,789
like to talk to the manager I need to

159
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,699
speak to the regional director I demand

160
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:12,219
a parley with a chief executive officer

161
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:16,300

162
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:18,190
directors I rudely request a one-on-one

163
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,560
conversation with the company founder

164
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,139
it's imperative that I receive my way

165
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,690
with the President of the United States

166
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:29,050
I will leave up one star review unless I

167
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,330
have an argument with the UN I demand to

168
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,300
be made an equal without your Lord and

169
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:36,339
