  abstract = {What does it mean for a language to have flexible constituent order, and what are the sources of variation in this domain, both within and across languages? This thesis addresses these questions by combining methods from traditional linguistic fieldwork with those from psycholinguistics, focusing on Malayalam (Dravidian), in which all six permutations of subject, object, and verb are grammatical and have the same truth-conditional meaning. I propose a novel operational measure of flexibility in constituent order which uses formal acceptability judgment experiments: a greater preference for canonical versus non-canonical orders is associated with decreased flexibility. I demonstrate the cross-linguistic validity of this measure by comparing English and Malayalam (Experiments 1 and 2). After considering in more detail the relationship between information structure and constituent order in Malayalam (Experiment 3), I show that formal acceptability experiments can measure variation in flexibility within Malayalam, with older participants exhibiting greater flexibility than younger participants (Experiment 4). I consider language contact as a potential source of this variation, and conclude with a discussion of the role of flexibility in contact-induced syntactic change. The approach proposed in this thesis not only allows for an enriched typology of constituent order, it also has implications for our understanding of how languages interact and change.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the relation between word surprisal and pupil dilation during reading. Participants’ eye movements and pupil size were recorded while they read single sentences. Surprisal values for each word in the sentence stimuli were estimated by both a recurrent neural network and a phrasestructure grammar. Higher surprisal corresponded to longer word-reading time, and this effect was stronger when surprisal values were estimated by the neural network. In addition, there was an early, positive effect of surprisal on pupil size, from about 250 ms before word ﬁxation until 100 ms after ﬁxation. This early effect, which was only signiﬁcant for the networkbased surprisal estimates, is suggestive of a preparation-based account of surprisal.},

Experiment 1 measured the change in pupil size of younger and older adults while they listened to spoken digit lists that varied in length and retained them brieﬂy for recall. In Experiment 2 changes in relative pupil size were measured while younger and older adults listened to sentences for later recall that varied in syntactic complexity and sentence length. Both age groups’ pupil sizes were sensitive to the size of the memory set in Experiment 1 and sentence length in Experiment 2, with the older adults showing a larger effect of the memory load on a normalized measure of pupil size relative to the younger adults. By contrast, only the younger adults showed a difference in the pupillary response to a change in syntactic complexity, even with an adjustment for the reduced reactivity of the older pupil.},

The present paper proposes a method based on dependency treebanks as a typological means. This paper investigates 20 languages using treebanks with different sizes from 16 K to 1 million dependencies. The results show that some languages are more head-initial or head-final than others, but all contain head-initial and head-final elements. The 20 languages can be arranged on a continuum with complete head-initial and head-final patterns as the two ends. Some data about subject–verb, object–verb and adjective–noun are extracted from the treebanks for comparison with the typological studies based on the traditional means, the results are similar. The investigation demonstrates that the proposed method is valid for positioning a language in the typological continuum and the resources from computational linguistics can also be used in language typology.},

This approach makes it possible to introduce new criteria for language classification, which would be difficult or impossible to achieve with the traditional, type-based approach. This point is illustrated by several quantitative studies of word order variation, which can be measured as entropy at different levels of granularity. I argue that this variation can be explained by general functional mechanisms and pressures, which manifest themselves in language use, such as optimization of processing (including avoidance of ambiguity) and grammaticalization of predictable units occurring in chunks. The case studies are based on multilingual corpora, which have been parsed using the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme.},

  title = {Quantifying {{Word Order Freedom}} in {{Dependency Corpora}}},
  abstract = {Using recently available dependency cor-pora, we present novel measures of a key quantitative property of language, word order freedom: the extent to which word order in a sentence is free to vary while conveying the same meaning. We discuss two topics. First, we discuss linguistic and statistical issues associated with our measures and with the annotation styles of available corpora. We find that we can measure reliable upper bounds on word order freedom in head direction and the ordering of certain sisters, but that more general measures of word order freedom are not currently feasible. Second, we present results of our measures in 34 lan-guages and demonstrate a correlation be-tween quantitative word order freedom of subjects and objects and the presence of nominative-accusative case marking. To our knowledge this is the first large-scale quantitative test of the hypothesis that lan-guages with more word order freedom have more case marking (Sapir, 1921; Kiparsky, 1997). 1},
