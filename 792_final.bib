  abstract = {The present paper discusses the benefits and challenges of token-based typology, which takes into account the frequencies of words and constructions in language use. This approach makes it possible to introduce new criteria for language classification, which would be difficult or impossible to achieve with the traditional, type-based approach. This point is illustrated by several quantitative studies of word order variation, which can be measured as entropy at different levels of granularity. I argue that this variation can be explained by general functional mechanisms and pressures, which manifest themselves in language use, such as optimization of processing (including avoidance of ambiguity) and grammaticalization of predictable units occurring in chunks. The case studies are based on multilingual corpora, which have been parsed using the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme.},

Properties with a distribution supporting a discrete feature analysis in many languages are likelier to be represented in WALS and to be represented accurately. This bias has important consequences when WALS typologies are interpreted theoretically or further processed statistically.},

  abstract = {Word-order typology often uses the linear order of binary grammatical pairs in sentences to classify a language. The present paper proposes a method based on dependency treebanks as a typological means. This paper investigates 20 languages using treebanks with different sizes from 16 K to 1 million dependencies. The results show that some languages are more head-initial or head-final than others, but all contain head-initial and head-final elements. The 20 languages can be arranged on a continuum with complete head-initial and head-final patterns as the two ends. Some data about subject–verb, object–verb and adjective–noun are extracted from the treebanks for comparison with the typological studies based on the traditional means, the results are similar. The investigation demonstrates that the proposed method is valid for positioning a language in the typological continuum and the resources from computational linguistics can also be used in language typology.},

  title = {Quantifying {{Word Order Freedom}} in {{Dependency Corpora}}},
  abstract = {Using recently available dependency cor-pora, we present novel measures of a key quantitative property of language, word order freedom: the extent to which word order in a sentence is free to vary while conveying the same meaning. We discuss two topics. First, we discuss linguistic and statistical issues associated with our measures and with the annotation styles of available corpora. We find that we can measure reliable upper bounds on word order freedom in head direction and the ordering of certain sisters, but that more general measures of word order freedom are not currently feasible. Second, we present results of our measures in 34 lan-guages and demonstrate a correlation be-tween quantitative word order freedom of subjects and objects and the presence of nominative-accusative case marking. To our knowledge this is the first large-scale quantitative test of the hypothesis that lan-guages with more word order freedom have more case marking (Sapir, 1921; Kiparsky, 1997). 1},
